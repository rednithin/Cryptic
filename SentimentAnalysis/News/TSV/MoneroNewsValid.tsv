vitalik buterin has expressed an interest in incorporating privacy features into ethereum. he is partial to the zk-snarks technology that is used in privacy coin zcash. nonetheless, his senses appear to be particularly keen about any developments surrounding privacy protocols. this became clear when a research paper was published entitled: &#8220;floodxmr: low-cost transaction flooding attack with monero’s bulletproof protocol.&#8221; the researchers decided to explore what they call a &#8220;flooding attack with monero&#8217;s bulletproof protocol.&#8221; in a nutshell, it involves an attacker flooding the network with their own transactions and then eliminating &#8220;mixins from transaction inputs.&#8221; in doing so, the	1

a recent article in fast company got me thinking. the article talks about how bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (particularly dash, which the article doesn’t mention) have helped venezuelans deal with insane inflation and the problem of liquidity. the piece says: many of us take for granted that we can use our money privately, without fear of reprisal or compromising our prospects. evidence suggests that for many this may not long be the case. those intent on social control see the shift to digital money as an opportunity to tighten their grip on civic life and close off financial	1
