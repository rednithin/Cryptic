Bitcoin Fees Are High, But They Will Decrease With SegWit Soon	<p>Bitcoin transaction fees are high and it is costing users around $1 to $5 to send a single transaction. Wallet platforms and their fee estimators are recommending users to attach a fee of 250 satoshis per byte, which is substantially higher than the estimated fee before SegWit was activated. The Bitcoin Core development team’s transaction malleability and scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit) was expected to optimize bitcoin blocks by 75 percent. However, upon its completion, experts including former Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik criticized SegWit and the bitcoin network, primarily because fees remained high. Garzik’s criticism disregarded the fact that </p>

All kinds of horror scenarios are brought up. Granted, the fact that you can send Bitcoin from one person to another over the internet makes it vulnerable to hacking attempts.

Bitcore Team developing A Multisignature Wallet	<p>The Bitcore team has been developing Cosign: A Multisignature Wallet. This technology would provide additional layers of security to protect Bitcoins. This wallet would allow for a multi-signature wallet to validate all transactions before they are sent, thus significantly reducing theft that occurs within businesses that deal with digital currencies. Let&#8217;s say we have a 5 signature wallet, one person can spend the Bitcoins like normal; however, the transaction will appear as partially signed and not be broadcast to the Bitcoin network unless it is signed by 3 of the co-signers of the wallet. &#160; &#160; Let&#8217;s look at this </p>

Mt gox ‘Discovery’: US Lawyers not convinced.	<p>Mt gox&#8217;s announcement, yesterday, that it had &#8216;Discovered&#8217; an old format wallet containing almost twenty-five percent of the missing bitcoins is being viewed as highly suspect.  The bankrupt exchange has found the missing coins at a time when many are paying careful attention to blockchain transactions. Indeed I wrote on this myself on March 9th in an article entitled &#8220;$113 Million of missing bitcoins may be moving through blockchain.&#8221; Mt gox has announced that they immediately informed the relevant authorities of the substantial recovery, however, one man isn&#8217;t quite buying their story.

Bitcoin and the issue of Trust	<p>Bitcoin (unlike many other cryptocurrencies) does meet many of the requirements of fiat money but as an institution some of its advocates have been doing it few favours. Many members of the general public see Bitcoin as a scam and in order to sell it to these  people we must deal with the thorny issue of trust. In order to establish trust I would contend that we, as advocates, should consider changing our emphases to improve stability and thereby increase acceptance. We will have an immersed society when a citizen can pull up at a shop and order a pizza </p>

Bitcore Released By BitPay – Access to App Tools	<p>BitPay has recently created Bitcore, based on removing centralized API systems and allows apps to interact directly with the Bitcoin network itself. This allows apps to continue working even if the server hosting the API goes down, and allows more decentralization.&#160; Bitcore uses node.js, which is a Javascript runtime.
