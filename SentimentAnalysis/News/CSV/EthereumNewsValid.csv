<p>By CCN: Ethereum’s status as a legitimate transactional currency was confirmed once again this week &#8211; by none other than the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC’s recent lawsuit against Kik (KIN) details the particulars of the KIN token sale &#8211; the public phase of which was carried out against ETH, as opposed to the U.S dollar. Throughout the official court document, the SEC appears to accept Ethereum as legitimate legal tender.

<p>By CCN: Bits of Gold, Israel&#8217;s largest broker of bitcoin and Ethereum, can keep its bank account with the country&#8217;s biggest bank. That&#8217;s the decision from Israel&#8217;s Supreme Court on Monday.

<p>By CCN: Ethereum wunderkind Vitalik Buterin maintained his hardline stance on Bitcoin SV in a recent interview, calling Craig Wright’s cryptocurrency a “complete scam.&#8221; Speaking with YouTuber Hardcore Crypto, Buterin left little room for interpretation regarding his thoughts on BSV. The Ethereum co-founder also gave his thoughts on decentralized exchanges and the worryingly centralized accumulation of power by Binance. Ethereum Co-Founder: Bitcoin SV is a &#8216;Complete Scam&#8217; Just in case there was any doubt remaining about Buterin’s thoughts on Bitcoin SV, he told Hardcore Crypto: “Obviously BSV is a complete scam, but the delisting from Binance &#8211; that was interesting. </p>

<p>By CCN: Ethereum has had a fantastic – if expected – turn-around the past few weeks, launching the second-largest cryptocurrency above $250. In the glory days of the ICO run, when transaction fees were high &#8211; and demand for Ether was also high &#8211; the ETH price sailed over $1,000. What are the odds of that happening now, or soon? Ethereum: Can ETH Join Bitcoin in Four-Figure Territory? Ethereum has faced stiff competition from other smart contract platforms, notably Tron and EOS. In the “enterprise” space, there are also several competitors, including NEO, Aelf, and more.

<p>By CCN: Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper is one of the biggest advocates of the cryptocurrency space. He is famous for his bullish $250,000 bitcoin price prediction, which would reflect a 5% market share around the world in the coming years. Draper supports competition in the space and in addition to bitcoin is also a fan of smart contract technology, other blockchains including Ethereum, artificial intelligence, and big data. But something he reportedly takes an issue with is Ethereum economics, particularly the issuance of between 2% and 4% of ETH supply each year. In an interview with Ethereum Classic Labs, </p>

<p>By CCN: Ethereum price(ETH) has depreciated more than 10-percent against the US dollar as the global cryptocurrency market undergoes a massive correction. The ETH-to-dollar dropped to $235.44 on Coinbase as on May 30, 2100, UTC after rallying for five weeks consecutively. The pair attempted a small pullback from its newfound intraday low, but could not extend it to cover the intraday losses. The price action, overall, appeared weak, indicating that Ethereum could continue its plunge to test new downside targets. Ahead of the correction, the Ethereum price established its year-to-date peak at $288.77 on Coinbase. However, the level experienced a huge </p>

<p>&#160; By CCN: CryptoKitties, a smart contract-fueled decentralized app (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, was supposed to be the one to jumpstart mainstream adoption of crypto. You know, kind of like the Mario Bros of crypto, but instead of Luigi and Mario, there are digital cats. After all, it was the app to clog the Ethereum blockchain, causing a bottleneck from the game&#8217;s popularity that slowed transactions to a snail&#8217;s pace. Nonetheless, the crypto ecosystem is still waiting for that one &#8216;killer app&#8217; now that CryptoKitties and other promising dApps failed to gain scale. The digital collectibles are worth </p>

<p>By CCN: The crypto ecosystem often explores which blockchain will emerge as the &#8216;Ethereum killer.&#8217; So far, no network has been able to muscle the second-biggest blockchain off its perch, but now there&#8217;s a new kid in town – Ava, and it has Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Visa in its sights.

<p>By CCN: It has been almost a year and a half since bears took over crypto markets. Bitcoin took a massive beating as it shed 84% of its value. Other large-cap coins shared more brutal fates. Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS were all devalued by more than 90%. Last year was full of trials and tribulations for retail investors. Thankfully, the ordeal is finally over. With bitcoin’s unbelievable run over the last few days, altcoins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS have responded with massive technical breakouts.
