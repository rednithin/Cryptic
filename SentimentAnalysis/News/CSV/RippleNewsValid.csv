<p>By CCN: People are feeling notably bullish about Ripple, or XRP, depending on what you’re talking about. The token price is earning bullish calls on Twitter. .50 cent and beyond incoming $xrp &#8212; Sir Gordon Gekko (@gordongekko369) June 2, 2019 Fifty cents would go a long way to making longtime XRP investors whole and earning handsome returns on long-held investments.

<p>&#160; By CCN: With bitcoin creeping within inches of $9,000 on Bitfinex a few days ago, it seems that all eyes are on the king of cryptocurrencies. While the digital coin looks bullish, we believe that it has topped off for now. Thus, it will serve you better to look elsewhere, specifically at ethereum, ripple (XRP), and cardano. These three cryptocurrencies are showing unbelievable strength, and they are not getting the attention they deserve. Ethereum Price on the Verge of Surging to $365 Far too many traders are sleeping on ethereum. Some even bet that the cryptocurrency would fall below </p>

<p>By CCN: Ripple is arguably the most divisive cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, the company surpassed a 200-customer milestone as financial institutions such as Transpaygo, WorldCom Finance, and Euro Exim Bank signed up for RippleNet. If Ripple was like any other cryptocurrency, enthusiasts would have celebrated this accomplishment. Except for the XRP Army, the company is not getting any love from the crypto community. In this article, we explore the reasons why corporations love Ripple while almost everybody else hates it. Why Corporations Love Ripple It is quite easy to understand why corporations love Ripple.

More importantly, the bank-friendly cryptocurrency’s escrow process diverges significantly from the way it was presented initially.

<p>By CCN: Ripple&#8217;s honeymoon in the cryptocurrency market may be over. The XRP-to-dollar exchange rate on Friday established an intraday low towards $0.359 on BitStamp amidst a flash crash action. The pair attempted to bounce back, but the volume was not adequate to erase its latest drop. On the whole, it plunged up to 25-percent in just two days, implying that its previous bullish sentiment is close to fading. XRP&#8217;s market mirrored sentiment as that of other top cryptocurrencies. The last 24 hours witnessed bitcoin, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency, depreciating against the US dollar by 8-percent. Meanwhile, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, </p>

<p>One of the issues casting a shadow on the XRP cryptocurrency is just how decentralized it is. After all, Ripple owns the lion&#8217;s share of XRP&#8217;s supply and relies on the cryptocurrency to power its cross-border payment products. Ripple CTO David Schwartz, however, insists that the blockchain startup is not pulling the strings on the cryptocurrency. Schwartz participated in a Quora session, saying in response to a question on whether XRP is controlled by Ripple: &#8220;Absolutely not.

<p>A group of us received an e-mail first thing this Sunday morning. A Ripple/XRP aficionado wanted to let us know we’re “very unprofessional” for interchangeably using the terms “Ripple” and “XRP.” The “XRP Army,” as it were, likely has its sights on CCN. We have no editorial policy regarding these terms in place. A writer is free to use whichever term makes their meaning clearer. Ripple fanatics believe that calling XRP “Ripple” is simply wrong. They want to be “crystal clear” – on what? Does anyone give a damn besides them? Why is a company 100% dedicated to the advancement </p>
