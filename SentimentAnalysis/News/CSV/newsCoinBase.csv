<p>By CCN: The markets may be moving into the green, but 30 Coinbase engineers will be seeing red tonight after they were reportedly laid off and the firm&#8217;s Chicago office closed. It&#8217;s a sure sign that despite positive sentiment returning, the crypto bear market is still determined to shrink a few more businesses before it&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s also a signal that mainstream financial players haven&#8217;t been ready to take the plunge into crypto. A Coinbase spokesperson told CCN: &#8220;Coinbase has consolidated our matching engine efforts into our San Francisco office. This means we are shutting down the matching engine efforts </p>

<p>Blockchain.com, one of the oldest non-custodial wallet services on the web, has decided to #delistBSV. While the official note on the subject offers no justification or reasoning, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith posted a few Tweets earlier today which indicate the philosophical drive for the decision: At @blockchain, we added support for close out only transactions (sell, send) for #BSV in January in the @blockchain Wallet and have encouraged users to sell or take their #BSV elsewhere&#8230; &#8212; Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) April 15, 2019 In the next thirty days, we will end even close out support for #BSV transactions.

<p>CCN received a ‚Äúconsumer warning‚Äù this morning from a crypto tax preparation firm. The warning outlines two aspects of crypto tax that the firm believes have been done wrong by other outfits ‚Äì namely Bitcoin exchange Coinbase and Intuit, the creator of TurboTax. As regards Coinbase, the firm writes: &#8220;The online tax guidance provided by Coinbase implies that airdrops are taxable as ordinary income‚Äîwhich is reported on Line 21 of Schedule 1 of Form 1040‚Äîrather than as capital gains that only become taxable when the positions are sold.&#8221; Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Clarifies Crypto Tax Guide We reached out to Coinbase, </p>

<p>Coinbase is the most popular U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. The company boasts more accounts than the likes of Charles Schwab. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has the ambitious goal for Coinbase to become the &#8220;Google of crypto,&#8221; suggesting that its relevance to Web 3.0 could rival that of the internet search giant&#8217;s stamp on the early version of the internet. Armstrong himself was named among Fortune&#8217;s 40 under 40 list and has influenced Americans for bitcoin. Unfortunately, rather than being celebrated, Coinbase increasingly resembles a victim of its own success. Despite having more to lose than many of its peers, Coinbase at </p>

<p>Miguel Vias, the head of XRP markets at Ripple, denied allegations of paying off Coinbase to list XRP on their cryptocurrency exchange. The response followed a series of bribery accusations shot towards Coinbase after its sudden¬†announcement¬†of adding XRP trading pairs to its platform on Feb 26. In contrast, the US exchange had earlier remained cautious of the said listing. As many speculate, Coinbase&#8217;s careful approach was due to XRP&#8217;s controversial history with Ripple Labs, a San Francisco startup that owns 60% of XRP &#8211; a stock worth billions of dollars. What also concerned the company was a pending $167.7 million </p>

<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has responded to criticisms about betraying the values of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly with its recent acquisition of Neutrino. Those Neutrino team members who previously worked at Hacking Team will ‚Äútransition out of Coinbase,‚Äù the chief executive said late Monday. Hacking Team, one may recall, was a pioneer in selling hacking tools exploited by authoritarian governments to crack down on journalists and dissidents instead of criminals. Congrats to Coinbase on the acquisition of chain analysis startup Neutrino! FYI, the CEO, Giancarlo Russo, was ex-COO of HackingTeam (https://t.co/qyQ6mLU8XE), who sold &#34;offensive intrusion and surveillance capabilities to </p>

<p>Coinbase‚Äôs controversial acquisition of Neutrino was motivated by a desire to ditch its existing tech partners because they ‚Äùwere actually selling client data to outside sources,‚Äù the head of sales at Coinbase said on Saturday. In an interview with Cheddar, Coinbase‚Äôs Christine Sandler explained the rationale for buying Neutrino‚Äî a blockchain intelligence firm whose founders used to build hacking tools to sell to the police. We are aware of the backgrounds of some of the folks that were involved in Neutrino and we are looking into that. I think the compelling reason for making the acquisition was that Neutrino really </p>

<p>Privacy has been a heated discussion for decades. Recently, legislation has been passed to provide greater protections for consumer data including GDPR, BDSG-New, and CCPA. The age-old question is: ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt doing anything wrong, why do you need privacy?‚Äù The answer isn‚Äôt so simple. Ranging from the mental health impacts of not having privacy to determining what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or who decides what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, arguments have no bounds on the topic, hence a base-level provision for personal privacy. In acquiring Neutrino, Coinbase is gearing up to strip away privacy from their users, regardless of their intention of use: </p>

<p>Coinbase announced the listing of Ripple (XRP) on Coinbase Pro yesterday. The massive-supply token saw a significant price rise on the news. However, as first identified by Diar, Coinbase‚Äôs listing of the bank-friendly coin appears to violate its own Digital Asset Framework, which outlines requirements which cryptocurrency assets must meet prior to their listing on the US exchange. Coinbase: We Won&#8217;t List Cryptocurrency if Company Controls Majority Stake Coinbase‚Äôs GDAX Digital Asset Framework outlines the types of crypto tokens it will list. On page five of the document, it states: &#8220;The ownership stake retained by the team is a minority </p>

<p>For years, supporters of the Ripple blockchain network and its native cryptocurrency XRP have anticipated the listing of the asset on Coinbase, the largest digital asset exchange in the U.S. Many investors have believed that the integration of XRP by Coinbase could be considered as a confirmation of regulatory clearance on the nature of the digital asset as a nonsecurity. However, Jake Chervinsky, a government enforcement defense and securities litigation attorney at Kobre &#38; Kim LLP said that there are too many variables to directly conclude XRP as a nonsecurity. Why Did Coinbase Integrate Ripple (XRP) Now? Like any other </p>
