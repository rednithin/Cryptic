There are 17 million Bitcoins outstanding, each costing about $8000. Are there 17 million people in the world who could afford 1 Bitcoin? That would </p>

<p>Uncertainty in the cryptocurrency mining market has led to the world&#8217;s leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor, to lower its revenue forecast for the year. Adding insult to injury, weakness in demand for Apple&#8217;s iPhone, for which Taiwan Semi is the supplier, is also weighing on this year&#8217;s expected sales. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining was the champion of 2017, helping to drive Taiwan Semi&#8217;s 2017 revenue results higher by 6%, including a 10.1% increase in the fourth quarter alone. Now volatility in the bitcoin price, which has cut into miners&#8217; profits, is taking its toll. &#8220;For the whole year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, </p>

<p>Microsoft has released a blog post discussing the emerging threat of malicious cryptocurrency miners. The post from the Windows Defender Research blog noted that the number of enterprise computers encountering unauthorized coin miners doubled from December to January 2018. Microsoft suggest that the reason for this rise is that cyber criminals are moving to this form of attack due to the exponential increase in cryptocurrency valuations. Along the way attackers are ditching ransom and other attacks, which have seen a marked fall. According to Microsoft, malicious coin mining can come in various forms and can be distributed in many different </p>

<p>Electronics bazaars in Asia are receiving a flood of international buyers looking for cheap cryptocurrency mining equipment.

One key destination is Hong Kong&#8217;s Sham Shui Po market, which is made even more attractive due to the lack of sales tax. However, the boom in sales is being felt across Asia &#8211; a welcome respite. Sales had been falling in recent </p>

There is a great concern about what the environmental impact would be from all this electrical usage. Most of this electricity is generated from Carbon dioxide fossil fuels. Large amounts of energy </p>

<p>The Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than 159 individual countries including ireland, a new report by CBS revealed. In contrary to most claims, bitcoin’s massive consumption of electricity is a positive aspect of the cryptocurrency, as it provides more security value to the network.

We planned to add this feature to the code to empower customers to control their miners which often times can be hosted outside their premises. This was after more than one incident of miners being stolen from </p>

<p>Gregory Maxwell, Blockstream’s CTO, has made an astonishing statement in the mailing list regarding an algorithmic optimization called AsicsBoost which was revealed last year. Maxwell states: “Due to a design oversight the Bitcoin proof of work function has a potential attack which can allow an attacking miner to save up-to 30% of their energy costs (though closer to 20% is more likely due to implementation overheads).” It’s not clear what Maxwell means by “design oversight.” It could simply be the fact that proof of work allows for the use of specialized software which can be optimized leading to an arms </p>
