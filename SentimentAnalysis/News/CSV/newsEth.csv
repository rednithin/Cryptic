<p>By CCN: Elon Musk might have the SEC breathing down his neck about Tesla, but he&#8217;s having some fun with crypto Twitter. In a one-word tweet, he single-handily drew in the entire crypto community to his thread.  The Tesla CEO simply said &#8220;Ethereum.&#8221; After he let the cat out of the bag, the ETH price started moving, erasing declines that have weighing on the second-biggest cryptocurrency all day and turning them into gains, albeit briefly. Elon Musk might want to tread lightly or he&#8217;ll get the SEC after him yet again for a completely different reason this time. jk &#8212; </p>

<p>By CCN.com: The blockchain bug seems to have bitten French banking giant Societe Generale to a point of no return. A little over a year ago, the third largest bank in France by assets unveiled a blockchain-based trade finance platform for all its corporate clients, the we.trade platform. Now Societe Generale has found another use case for blockchain technology – bond issuance. In a statement, the giant lender has revealed that its covered bond unit, Societe General SFH, has issued its first covered bond on the Ethereum blockchain worth over $110 million.

<p>By CCN: These are heady times for Binance Coin (BNB), the in-house cryptocurrency launched by the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Binance. BNB hit a new all-time high a few days ago and the exchange successfully launched Binance chain, which features BNB and marks the coin&#8217;s independence from Ethereum. The cryptosphere has been filled with noises about BNB possibly being the new &#8220;Ethereum killer.&#8221; Weiss Ratings took the conversation a step further, suggesting that BNB might even be the new bitcoin. It seems #BNB is leading the market now – when BNB is up, the market is up – and vice </p>

<p>By CCN: Years ago, a thief had a simple idea: figure out a way to guess Ethereum private keys and write software to sweep the crypto funds from the blockchain. Guessing the 72-character private key is no small feat – your odds are about 1 in 115 quattuorvigintillion. No, we didn’t make that number up. The researchers told Wired that trying to do this without the help of high-powered computers would be like: “ Choosing a grain of sand on a beach, and later asking a friend to find that same grain among a ‘billion gazillion’ beaches.” The Fatal Flaw </p>

<p>By CCN: An official announcement from the British Virgin Islands says that the island protectorate has entered a partnership with a blockchain company. The company, LifeLabs, makes a wallet and has a token called LIFE on the Ethereum blockchain. The wallet supports Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the firm&#8217;s own crypto tokens.

<p>By CCN: Vitalik Buterin is known first and foremost as the creator of Ethereum, but he&#8217;s also famous for his disdain of centralized exchanges. After previously wishing that centralized exchanges would all &#8220;burn in hell&#8221;, now Buterin is coming to their defense. In an exposition reminding the crypto community about the pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Buterin tackles one of the most controversial issue dominating crypto at the moment &#8212; Craig Wright and his brainchild Bitcoin SV. &#8220;I personally have been a critic of the power wielded by centralized exchanges.

<p>By CCN: In four-to-six weeks, a blockchain product developed by Ernst &#38; Young (EY), one of the “big four” professional services organizations, will be made public domain (open source). Privacy and Public Blockchains: A Tall Order From Large Enterprise Dubbed “EY Ops Chain Public Edition,” the technology uses zero-knowledge proofs to give permissions to transaction information similar to Monero and other privacy coins.

<p>By CCN.com: Ethereum development studio ConsenSys is struggling financially and is now trying to raise $200 million from outside investors to stay afloat. The fundraising drive comes just four months after the Brooklyn-based blockchain startup laid off 13% of its workforce. ConsenSys has not yet commented on the rumors, which were reported by The Information. Sources say the crypto company wants its valuation to top $1 billion, but prospective investors believe that&#8217;s unrealistic given its current financial woes.

<p>At the Community Ethereum Development Conference (EDCON 2019) in Sydney, Australia, Vitalik Buterin set an interesting precedent for prominent crypto developers: he got on stage and rapped about Ethereum scaling. Vitalik Buterin: Crypto&#8217;s Next Rap Genius? In case you&#8217;re wondering, this isn&#8217;t a punishingly delayed April Fools&#8217; joke.  Here&#8217;s the proof: Buterin’s rap debut starts: &#8220;Proof-of-stake is hard, but one thing I do know is when we  and shard, we’ll change the whole thing though. Eth 2.0, yo. Eth 2.0, yo…&#8221; The rap refers to the upcoming scaling upgrades that Ethereum will undergo, including its move to proof-of-stake and </p>

<p>The ethereum price has ballooned by nearly one-third so far in April, but without bitcoin&#8217;s bullish tailwind, ETH might be stuck in a rut. According to Dapp.com, the second-largest cryptocurrency&#8217;s network suffered defections in Q1 2019 as users fled the network for rival platforms. If users would only stay loyal to decentralized apps (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain, the ETH price might finally recapture its former glory. Crypto Gamers and the Ethereum Price As one of the largest and most high-profile blockchains, Ethereum has every reason to be leading the dApp race against rival platforms such as Tron, EOS, and </p>

<p>Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun recently announced on the CryptoChick podcast that his crypto project would be officially collaborating with Ethereum. Wait, what? Justin Sun: Tron Will Collaborate with Ethereum This Year Justin Sun appeared on an episode of Rachel Wolfson’s TheCryptoChick podcast this week where he discussed the launch of the Tether stablecoin on Tron. While most of the podcast came off as a marketing opportunity for Sun, he did also take the time to address the prospect of a collaboration with Ethereum. When asked by Wolfson what he thought of Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin’s recent jab at </p>

<p>During what has become the longest bear market to date in cryptocurrency, it’s no surprise that anxious investors are eager to find alternative strategies to continue making gains during the downturn. One of those strategies, which has become a hot trend in crypto, is the practice known as staking. Staking: Crypto Investing&#8217;s Hot New Trend In staking, investor-owned tokens are placed in digital crypto wallets and then used to validate transactions that create new blocks in blockchain networks. This, in turn, produces coin rewards that can increase the holder’s total asset value. While vaguely similar to traditional banks’ interest-bearing accounts, </p>

<p>In the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin Cash surged from $287 to $322 by more than 12 percent as the valuation of the crypto market increased by around $4 billion. The 3 percent recovery of bitcoin led major crypto assets in the likes of Litecoin, TRON, and Ethereum Classic to record relatively large movements against the U.S. dollar. Why are Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash Surging While Ethereum and Bitcoin Settle For Minor Gains? Bitcoin spiked by more than 20 percent in the past week which played a vital role in changing the sentiment around the cryptocurrency market. But, </p>

<p>Readers may remember the legendary moment last year when Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin responded to a talk by Craig Wright to call him a “fraud.” Buterin had endured enough of what he viewed to be baseless claims on the part of Wright, who at the time was talking about “dishonest miners&#8221; in the crypto economy. Bitcoin SV Proponents Rant about &#8220;Legal Ramifications&#8221; of SegWit As the year wore on, Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre increasingly engaged in in-fighting with Bitcoin Cash developers and community members.

<p>By CCN.com: In a further sign of the blurring of the lines between crypto and mainstream assets, it will soon be possible to trade bitcoin on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE). The exchange which was founded five decades ago has inked an agreement with Canadian fintech firm Blockchain that will ‘enable live trading of digital assets and security tokens in a regulated and secured environment’, according to a statement. Under the agreement, Blockstation will offer the end-to-end crypto trading platform for JSE’s network. This followed a test-run in which the broker-dealer members of the JSE participated.

<p>Several outlets and crypto programmers have pointed out for a year or more that MetaMask, by default, broadcasts your Ethereum public key (address) to websites you visit. The assumption is that this is a privacy vulnerability – most sites have no need for such information, after all. The Next Web’s David Canellis writes: &#8220;Sharing Ethereum addresses with any tracking service that requests it is certainly a little unsettling, but there are wider implications. Think of your Ethereum address as a unique identifier, you want to keep it separate from the rest of your online footprint at all times.&#8221; Public Addresses </p>

<p>Throughout the past month, the price of Ethereum (ETH) increased from $126 to $140, by more than 11 percent against the U.S. dollar. Similar to how several strategists expect the bitcoin price to increase substantially if it breaks the $4,200 resistance level in the near-term, traders foresee Ethereum rising to as high as $200 if it rebounds over crucial levels. $148 For Ethereum is Key According to a cryptocurrency technical trader recognized by the community as “The Crypto Dog,” the price of Ethereum could surpass $200 if it breaks out of $148 and continues to demonstrate momentum in the weeks </p>

<p>There’s a buzz in the cryptosphere today. Bitcoin dominance hasn’t been this low since last August. Google trends show that interest in Bitcoin hasn’t been this low since last April. Are we in the quiet before the storm or status quo? Dominance is hovering just above 50%. A result of “alt season,” money rapidly flowing into altcoins and a relatively stagnant Bitcoin price conspire to lower the actual position of Bitcoin. But not by much. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization can still fit hundreds of other cryptos within it. This Isn&#8217;t 2015 or 2017 &#8211; The Market Is Far More Crowded Some </p>

<p>The bitcoin price is demonstrating a similar movement as late 2018 and traders have started to express concerns over the extended stability of the asset. From early September to November, for more than three months, the bitcoin price remained stable in a tight range between $6,300 to $6,500. However, in a matter of weeks, the bitcoin price plunged by around 50 percent from $6,500 to $3,200.
