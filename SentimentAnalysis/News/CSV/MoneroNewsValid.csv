<p>By CCN: According to self-declared Bitcoin creator Craig Wright, everyone who runs a Lightning node, uses privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero, or uses mixing services like CashShuffle will be guilty of money laundering and eventually suffer the brutal legal consequences. Wright says that once courts figure out the money transmitter nature of various blockchain products, swift action can be expected. Satoshi Nakamoto Calls for Government Regulation? Wright believes that a few government orders could swiftly lead to the destruction of several blockchain systems. He acknowledges that this will not be good news for crypto investors, but he insists it’s probably on the </p>

<p>By CCN: Monero recently hard-forked once again to stave off ASIC miners, who take over the network after a time and are disliked by the Monero community. Monero would prefer to be a CPU and at-most GPU coin, which is mined by the people who use it. Binance discusses Monero’s moves in a new report released over the weekend. Binance noted that there were some negative consequences associated with permanently kicking ASIC miners off the network. Decreased Monero Hashrate Worries Binance For one thing, a steep drop in hashrate, which was to be expected. For another thing, block times increased </p>

<p>By CCN: DAPS stands for “decentralized anonymous payment system.” DAPS Coin’s motto is “privacy is a right, not a privilege.” Mixing Privacy and Proof-of-Stake They’re launching in a growing market of privacy coins, hoping to deliver a superior product that might shake things up. DAPS Coin borrows all of the best ideas from other privacy coins like Dash and Monero and integrates them into one blockchain using proof-of-stake. It sports the Bulletproof Protocol, which drastically reduced the cost of Monero transactions last year. From a technical standpoint, DAPS Coin is intriguing because of all the things it incorporates. In an </p>

<p>By CCN: Vitalik Buterin has expressed an interest in incorporating privacy features into Ethereum. He is partial to the ZK-SNARKS technology that is used in privacy coin Zcash. Nonetheless, his senses appear to be particularly keen about any developments surrounding privacy protocols. This became clear when a research paper was published entitled: &#8220;FloodXMR: Low-cost transaction flooding attack with Monero’s bulletproof protocol.&#8221; The researchers decided to explore what they call a &#8220;flooding attack with Monero&#8217;s bulletproof protocol.&#8221; In a nutshell, it involves an attacker flooding the network with their own transactions and then eliminating &#8220;mixins from transaction inputs.&#8221; In doing so, the </p>

<p>At press time, interest in Monero had increased 400% over the past hour. Five US states lead the charge, according to Google Trends: &#160; Top 5 US States for Monero The five states listed are: • Indiana • Arizona • Arkansas • Colorado • Louisiana Interest in Indiana came primarily from Terre Haute, while curiousity in Arkansas came mainly Little Rock and this reporter’s city of Pine Bluff.

<p>By CCN.com: A recent article in Fast Company got me thinking. The article talks about how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (particularly Dash, which the article doesn’t mention) have helped Venezuelans deal with insane inflation and the problem of liquidity. The piece says: Many of us take for granted that we can use our money privately, without fear of reprisal or compromising our prospects. Evidence suggests that for many this may not long be the case. Those intent on social control see the shift to digital money as an opportunity to tighten their grip on civic life and close off financial </p>

<p>A warning has been posted to the Monero subreddit regarding Monero version 0.14 and Ledger 1.1.3. The bug appears to incorrectly process change transactions. One user appears to claim they’ve lost 1600 Monero, worth nearly $83,000 at press time. No proof of this claim was offered, but the user says: I didn&#8217;t get it back. I restored my seed on another Ledger and the balance was still 0.

<p>Dr. Craig Wright is back. And this time, he is out to destroy the societally menacing anonymous coins. The Australian computer scientist and alleged creator of Bitcoin told CNBC Africa&#8217;s Ran Neuner that he knows how to kill Zcash and Monero. Dr. Wright said that he was going to expose these anonymous coins sometime this year, adding: &#8220;If you have a privacy coin, I will show you that it is basically as private as running through Times Square with your pants around your ankles.&#8221; If what Dr. Wright is saying is correct, then it is a piece of troubling news </p>

<p>Norwegian Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen (68) has been missing since October 31st last year according to the Norwegian Police. Her husband, Tom Hagen, is Norway&#8217;s 172 richest person according to Kapital. Serious threats have been made by what appears to be the kidnappers, which is why the police has kept a low profile since they started investigating the missing person case in November 2018. The police explain that they have chosen to go public as their massive investigation has produced few leads. They need more information and believe the public might be able to help.

<p>Fortnite fans can now buy merchandise for the blockbuster online video game using the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Bitcoin payments are not yet accepted, reportedly due to privacy concerns. While Fortnite did not make an official announcement, fans shared the news on Reddit on January 1, where it received a very positive reception. Monero enthusiasts said the move signals that crypto adoption is expanding, since Fortnite is the most popular video game in the world, with more than 200 million registered users.

<p>Bitcoin Price Recovery Alongside Network Changes The Bitcoin price came back from the brink this week, reaching nearly $4,000 by Sunday. Analysts were at times throughout the week worried that it would lose support around $3,400 and then drop beneath $3,000, but this hasn’t happened. At the same time, however, two important Bitcoin network metrics saw reduced performance over the week. For one thing, mining difficulty – which signifies the number of miners on the network – dropped by 7% during the week. David Hundeyin explained: In the light of the bitcoin blockchain’s reduced hashrate caused by withdrawing miners, the </p>

<p>There will be a total of 18.4 million Monero&#8217;s XMR coins in circulation by May 31, 2022. And the project has already mined more than 90% of it. Per data available at MoneroBlocks.info, a Monero blockchain explorer, the privacy-enabled cryptocurrency have emitted close 16.6 million XMR. As the emission forms parity with the total supply, the Monero project will switch to a new supply program, dubbed as tail emission. The project&#8217;s earlier announcements indicate that miners will obtain a consistent mining reward of 0.6 XMR per block that would likely maintain the overall security and integrity of Monero blockchain. &#8220;Miners need </p>

<p>According to a recent post from Z-Cash’s official blog, more services are now offering the use of shielded or private addresses now as a result of the Sapling upgrade. The upgrade was touted as significantly improving the speed and efficiency of Z-Cash and enabling it to require less resources. The goal of the Zcash project is that all people inevitably prefer to use shielded or private addresses, as they wrote, “this is just the beginning for Zcash’s mission toward a shielded ecosystem.” Shielded addresses are different from transparent addresses, which anyone can see the activity of. In private cryptocurrencies, the </p>

<p>Within the past 24 hours, the crypto market has added $19 billion to its valuation as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $4,300. After dropping to the low $3,000 region, Bitcoin engaged in an unexpected price rally, rising by more than 15 percent on a single day. The newly established momentum of Bitcoin allowed the rest of the cryptocurrency market to recover. Major digital assets like Stellar (XLM), Cardano (ADA), Monero (XMR), and TRON (TRX) recorded gains in the range of 7 to 25 percent.

<p>Privacy-focused Zcash, currently worth just over $110 per coin, has completed a network upgrade dubbed “Sapling” that it says will vastly improve transaction speed as well as reduce the actual size of transactions themselves. Zcash hopes that this will make mobile and other types of transactions more common and feasible on the network, saying it “introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of Zcash shielded addresses.” Zcash has two types of addresses. A standard “t”-type (transparent) address works in the same way as most cryptocurrencies: sender and receiver </p>

<p>Following the successful execution of Monero&#8217;s hard fork on October 18, average transaction fees for XMR users have fallen a massive 97 percent from 60 cents to an average of just 2 cents according to information from CoinMetrics. Known as &#8220;Monero 0.13.0 Beryllium Bullet&#8221;, the recent hard fork implemented a trustless, non-interactive, zero-knowledge framework called &#8220;Bulletproofs&#8221; for the privacy coin, which enabled XMR transaction details to be hidden from public blockchain validation. &#8220;Bulletproofs&#8221; Makes Monero &#8220;Unfairly Cheap&#8221; Writing on Twitter, CoinMetrics confirmed the massive drop in Monero transaction fees, adding that average transaction size has fallen over 83 percent from </p>
