<p>Startup financing took a dramatic turn in 2017 as initial coin offerings (ICOs) burst onto the scene. In 2017 and 2018, more than $14 billion flowed into blockchain projects as investors looked to capitalize on crypto euphoria and the low barriers to entry made possible by the ICO funding model. It has been less than a year since the market for ICOs went bust, but the impact of the new crowdfunding model will endure for many years to come as startups look to tokenize real assets and leverage the power of the crowd to finance their next major project. But </p>

<p>Regulators can be blamed for just about everything. The team behind the Thor token is pointing the finger at them for the shuttering of their own operations. However, given Thor raised an impressive $21 million for its crypto project just last year, the excuse is falling on many deaf ears. There was speculation that something was amiss at the company before it made its announcement this week. For example, Thor reportedly locked its Telegram account so that users could not make comments. Some Thor token holders took matters into their own hands: because the main Thor Channel is muted we </p>

<p>A couple years ago, a person named Nick Ayton and his partner, David Lofts, launched an ICO to fund a television show. They then went on to found Chainstarter, which helps ICO-backed projects get off the ground. Chainstarter&#8217;s Use of 21 Million ICO Money A deep-dive by Cointelligence paints a much darker picture of the project and its goals. On Yavin, a researcher at Cointelligence, tells the story from beginning to end.

<p>Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a portal that would screen Initial Coin Offering projects (ICOs). The securities regulator told the Bangkok Post they interviewed &#8220;roughly&#8221; 7-8 portals for the job of selecting ICOs, conducting due diligence, reviewing smart contract codes, and verifying the know-your-customer process. Eventually, the SEC&#8217;s board of directors approved one ICO portal out of all. The commission refused to share any further details about the selected company, except that it was a non-Thailand venture. Archari Suppiroj, the SEC&#8217;s director of Fintech, confirmed that the commission had forwarded its selection to the relevant government agencies, including </p>

An ICO is when a company issues blockchain tokens that it will then sell in exchange for common cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are more fungible. The fuzzy regulatory status of ICOs and their resulting tokens </p>

<p>According to a report released by Kate Rooney, a markets reporter at CNBC, two congressmen &#8212; Warren Davidson and Darren Soto &#8212; are preparing a bipartisan bill to exclude crypto from the country’s securities law. The bill, entitled “Token Taxonomy Act,” is set to be introduced to the House in the months to come in an attempt to facilitate the growth of the cryptocurrency sector of the U.S. Could it Relieve Pressure on Crypto Assets and Tokens? If passed by the House, the bill will eliminate cryptocurrencies and initial coin offering (ICO) tokens from the scope of the U.S. Securities </p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours, the prices of both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have fallen by more than three percent against the U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency market experienced an abrupt $4 billion drop in its valuation, by just about 3.5 percent.

<p>Recently, Sirin Labs, an initial coin offering (ICO) project that raised $158 million during the bull market of 2017, made the headlines for its controversial pivot from a hardware-based business model to supplying software to mobile phone manufacturers.

<p>Envion AG, a crypto-based firm that aimed to combine cryptocurrency mining with green power, has been shut down by the cantonal court of Zug, Switzerland. The company was reportedly dissolved due to an alleged unauthorized Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on November 28, local German news outlet Handelsblatt reports.

<p>According to Kobre &#38; Kim government enforcement defense and securities litigation attorney Jake Chervinsky, the second phase of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s enforcement on crypto is a painful and slow grind for the sector.

The SEC is said to have targeted EtherDelta, Paragon, and AirFox as guidance settlements and to establish a precedent across the cryptocurrency sector, and is expected to clean up </p>

<p>Over the past two years, initial coin offering (ICO) projects in the crypto market have raised more than $30 billion. Yet, most ICO projects have little to show, especially pertaining to user growth, blockchain adoption, and overall user activity on decentralized systems.

Binance Coin (BNB), for instance, which already operates as the base cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, will be extensively utilized to process peer-to-peer trades upon the launch of the Binance </p>

<p>The recent crackdown on two initial coin offerings (ICOs) Paragon and AirFox by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could lead to many blockchain and crypto projects declaring bankruptcy in the coming months. As CCN reported on November 16, Paragon and AirFox were ordered to pay a $350,000 fine to the U.S. SEC and refund investors who participated in the token sale. The problem for the two tokens is that they have been asked by the US SEC to refund $12 million and $15 million respectively to investors, and since their ICOs, the prices of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and </p>

<p>Here’s something we don’t hear every day: a Swiss bank has opted to enable its clients to participate in initial coin offerings easily. The bank, Swissquote, has previously allowed customers to trade in cryptos. This is, to say the least, an unusual service for a fiat banking institution. Additionally, Swissquote offers traditional FOREX trading and the range of services that traditional banks offer.

<p>This morning, the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is holding a hearing on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, featuring testimony from New York University economist Nouriel Roubini.

Here are some highlights: 1. ‘Sh*tcoin’ Entered the Congressional Lexicon By the time this article is published, Roubini will have likely become the first person to use the word “sh*tcoin” in congressional testimony, </p>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is assessing every single ICO operating within its jurisdiction, Reuters reported on Oct. 8. ESMA chair Steven Maijoor — who warned crypto investors in Jan. 2018 that they could potentially lose all of their funds by investing in initial coin offerings (ICOs) — said that he had been observing the current regulations that can fit an ICO.  He added that, so far, these ICOs have been unable to reveal their &#8220;extra benefits&#8221; when compared with traditional capital raising companies. Maijoor explained to the EU&#8217;s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that some ICOs are similar to financial instruments and </p>
