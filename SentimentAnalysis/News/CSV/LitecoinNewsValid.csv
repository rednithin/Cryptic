<p>By CCN: Litecoin may not be immune to today&#8217;s crypto market sell-off, but the No. 5 cryptocurrency has been one of the leaders of 2019. In addition to the crypto market&#8217;s expanding value, the hashrate – which is a reflection of computing power dedicated to the network – has also been on the rise. Litecoin&#8217;s Hashrate Reaches an All-Time High Once again, Litecoin has been a standout, with its hashrate achieving a new all-time high, according to Litecoin Foundation Director Franklyn Richards in a recent blog post.

<p>By CCN: Crypto-mania has once again gripped mainstream financial outlets. CNBC’s Fast Money panel were beside themselves yesterday as they analyzed bitcoin and litecoin’s parabolic rise in recent months. The panel whooped and cheered at the mention of litecoin’s 400 percent price rise. The anchor ended the segment yelling: “Sell the house, sell the car, sell the kids.

<p>By CCN: As the bitcoin price barrels toward $9,000, the cryptocurrency community is riding high. Litecoin Creator Charlie Lee is among them, retweeting a meme from 2017 when the bitcoin price was nearing the $9K level for the first time ever. Now that bitcoin&#8217;s seemingly on its way back and beyond, other cryptocurrencies are also enjoying a bull run – including Lee&#8217;s Litecoin. LTC has added nearly 13% in the last 24 hours alone, bolstering the per-coin price to $115 on trading volume of roughly $7 billion. Litecoin Foundation Director Franklyn Richards recently evaluated some of the network fundamentals, suggesting </p>

<p>By CCN: Litecoin price (LTC) rose above $100 Friday for the first time in eight days, a move that marked the asset&#8217;s likelihood of retesting its 2019 high at $107.60. The world&#8217;s fifth largest cryptocurrency by market valuation bounced to 100.88 at 1106 UTC &#8211; the highest since May 17, 2019, according to San Francisco-based Coinbase exchange. The surge appeared in the wake of a market-wide upside correction, in which all the leading digital assets posted impressive intraday gains. Nevertheless, the session profits noted in the Litecoin market were higher than those in other assets&#8217; market. The past 24-hours alone saw the </p>

<p>By CCN: The Litecoin price has enjoyed a breakneck bull run in 2019, launching the cryptocurrency nearly 200 percent higher in less than six months. But while cautious investors might be tempted to take their profits and run, a crucial upcoming event could send Litecoin another 140% higher over the next three months, enabling LTC to eclipse the $220 mark for the first time in more than a year. The trigger from this mammoth ascent? Litecoin&#8217;s long-awaited &#8220;halvening,&#8221; which will slash block rewards by 50%, from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. Historically, such halvenings (or &#8220;halvings&#8221;) have proven to be </p>

<p>By CCN: It has been almost a year and a half since bears took over crypto markets. Bitcoin took a massive beating as it shed 84% of its value. Other large-cap coins shared more brutal fates. Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS were all devalued by more than 90%. Last year was full of trials and tribulations for retail investors. Thankfully, the ordeal is finally over. With bitcoin’s unbelievable run over the last few days, altcoins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS have responded with massive technical breakouts. This prompted us to declare that the crypto winter of 2018 is now behind </p>

<p>By CCN: The Litecoin price has surpassed $100 once again and nobody is more pumped about it than UFC Fighter Ben Askren. The LTC price hasn&#8217;t been trading in the triple digits since June 2018, according to CoinMarketCap data. It&#8217;s up more than 13% today and Litecoin disciple Askren is shouting it from the Twitter rooftops. Earlier this year, the Litecoin Foundation sponsored Askren, whose nickname is &#8220;Funky&#8221;, for UFC 235, his Ultimate Fighting Championship match in which he faced Robbie Lawler. Askren was named the winner of the match after three minutes and 20 seconds, but Litecoin won, too. </p>

<p>By CCN: Charlie Lee is selling more Litecoin, but not of the digital variety. After liquidating his LTC portfolio at year-end 2017, the Litecoin creator is now auctioning off what he describes as &#8220;unique collectibles&#8221;. These are more than a dozen physical coins with labels that are signed by Charlie Lee himself. Lee stated on the Bitcoin Forum: &#8220;I got some of my Lealana 25LTC &#38; 10LTC coins graded by ICG.

<p>By CCN: With the exception of bitcoin, Litecoin is arguably doing more than any other coin for mainstream adoption. Most recently, Litecoin Creator Charlie Lee has inked a partnership with Travala.com, a blockchain-based hotel booking platform. Even though Travala.com is another blockchain company, it&#8217;s a play on the travel industry and represents a use case that can serve as a model for future deals. While Expedia has shied away from accepting bitcoin, it could change its tune if Travala.com&#8217;s Litecoin payments take off. Charlie Lee stated in the announcement: &#8220;We are excited to work with Travala.com to make it easier </p>

<p>By CCN: Charlie Lee can&#8217;t seem to shake his reputation for offloading his Litecoin holdings near the peak. The Litecoin creator was featured in a podcast with Morgan Creek Digital Partner Anthony Pompliano where he fielded some tough questions both about his LTC portfolio and the state of the crypto industry. Something that you might not know is when Charlie decided to sell his Litecoins when the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $300 he expected the price to go much higher. He said on the podcast: &#8220;I actually personally did think it was going to keep going up. I didn&#8217;t </p>

Major crypto assets such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash spiked by 4 to 11 percent against the U.S. dollar. The unexpected recovery of the crypto market overnight comes after the office of the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against iFinex, alleging Bitfinex of mismanaging the cash reserves of stablecoin Tether.

<p>By CCN: The litecoin price has been one of the cryptocurrency market’s top performers in 2019, climbing a ridiculous 162 percent since the new year. Among large-cap cryptoassets, only binance coin has performed better, and litecoin’s year-to-date rally leaves the bitcoin price’s 40 percent advance in the dust.

<p>By CCN.com: Crypto trader Mike Novogratz fails to see the value in Litecoin. Novogratz, who is at the helm of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, blasts Litecoin&#8217;s size and in doing so seems to comes across as threatened by the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency. The Litecoin price has seen its value expand by 40% in April alone, gains that if you ask Novogratz would be better served by bitcoin. The former Fortress hedge fund manager capitalized on Litecoin&#8217;s reputation as being digital silver to bitcoin&#8217;s gold, comparing the size of the respective precious metal and crypto markets.
