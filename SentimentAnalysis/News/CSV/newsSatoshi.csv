<p>Elon Musk is many things. A billionaire, a visionary, the owner of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX and overall one of the most inspiring and intriguing figures we have in business today. With this appeal comes a never-ending supply of rumors and fake news, from quitting Tesla to join a bitcoin startup, to being called national disgrace and thief. Given the meteoric rise of mainstream cryptocurrency popularity, it should be no surprise that the elusive hunt for Satoshi, often referred to as the father of Bitcoin, has led to the theory that Elon Musk has been hiding a big secret </p>

<p>The bitcoin scaling debate has driven many people in the bitcoin community to assume a cult-like viewpoint, an observation Vinny Lingham makes with despair. In a blog titled, “Satoshi’s Choice,” Lingham observed that the bitcoin community has failed to maintain a level attitude aimed at achieving the greater good for the community. Hence, he doesn’t see a resolution to the current impasse on bitcoin scaling in the short term. Without a reasonable resolution to the current impasse, it will be difficult to avoid “exogenous pricing pressure” or another external catalyst for change. Emotions Get The Upper Hand Lingham noted that </p>

<p>Could the NSA build a quantum computer that could break bitcoin? Bitcoin visionary Andreas Antonopoulos addressed this question in an audiotaped presentation posted on SoundCloud. “It is certain that the NSA has already built quantum computers because Google has one at their data center, and if they have one, the NSA has one that’s ten times better, that costs as much as a moon mission, and can break encryption systems at a much better rate and with much more efficiency,” he said. Will The NSA Attack Bitcoin? The interesting question is: will they use it to break bitcoin? The answer to </p>

<p>Bitcoin is by default and by nature a currency which shows no respect for borders. One of the less popularized advantages of Bitcoin is that, through the power of encryption, immutable transactions are possible, as well as the ability to withhold funds from seizure. In the nations which are currently producing the most refugees, Bitcoin’s digitization is another great aspect of it – people are less likely to steal what they cannot see. A private key can be written and stored virtually anywhere. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin is precisely the currency you would want if your world were </p>

<p>(NYT)  Dorian S. Nakamoto, the man Newsweek alleged to have created the Bitcoin protocol, has hired a lawyer and issued a statement regarding his involvement with Bitcoin.  First reported by Reuters&#8217; Felix Salmon via twitter, Nakamoto&#8217;s statement released through his lawyer states plainly, I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin.  I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report. The statement goes on to reiterate that the first time Nakamoto ever heard the term &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221; was when the Newsweek reporter, Leah Goodman, contacted his son on the matter.  It also addresses Nakamoto&#8217;s qualifications, My background is in engineering.  I also </p>

<p>(CCN&#8217;s original live-updated coverage here) As Newsweek&#8217;s article regarding the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto surges through the community, many are stunned with disbelief. The man who signed every message with a PGP key, never gave away personal details despite communicating for years, and eluded numerous attempts to find him; could he have been using his real name the whole time? To be fair, his name is Dorian S. Nakamoto, that first name can really throw off searches.   Nonetheless, the evidence presented by Newsweek is circumstantial at best. Reporter Leah McGrath Goodman relies heavily on timeline coincidences, connecting the development </p>

<p>There&#8217;s a meme on r/Bitcoin used to describe excessive Bitcoin optimism; &#8220;all news is good news.&#8221; But despite the title, this isn&#8217;t an &#8220;all good news&#8221; story. It&#8217;s a story about what makes a successful economy. Surprisingly, the key to economic success is failure. I don&#8217;t mean this in a cheesy, &#8220;there are no failures, only learning experiences&#8221; motivational poster way. I mean that for  an economy to function efficiently, bad businesses need to falter and die, sometimes messily. Then those failed businesses need to be hacked apart, their accumulated resources scavenged and recycled back into the economy. This process </p>
