<p>Can Wall Street investors manipulate the cryptocurrency markets via Bitcoin futures? Based on the recent fall in the markets during the week of January 15th, it seems that “yes” is the answer to that question.

<p>NEM and its token XEM have made significant gains over the past few months. Some analysts including Koji Higashi, the co-founder of IndieSquare based in Japan, have attributed the increase in the market cap of NEM and price of XEM to the exponentially growing alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market in Japan. A major factor that has allowed NEM to transform into one of the most popular altcoins in Japan is its development team and company composed of Japanese founders and talents. NEM was initially developed and introduced in Japan by Makoto Takemiya, the co-founder and CEO of Soramitsu, the company that </p>

<p>Bitcoin price is on its way towards reaching $1,500. Over the past seven days, bitcoin has surged from $1,278 to $1,471, recording a 13.4 percent weekly increase in price.

<p>Poloniex, the biggest altcoin exchange with daily volume in tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands btc, is insecure according to an anonymous “really light testing” security review. Xavier59, whose StackExchange profile states “pparently, this user prefers to keep an air of mystery about them,” publicly released three vulnerabilities after claiming Poloniex failed to reply to his emails informing them of security bugs more than a month ago. The vulnerabilities, according to Xavier59, indicate incompetence and potential risks. The most prominent seems to be using Get (which is mainly employed for public information) instead of Post (mainly used for </p>

<p>Steem, a new digital currency created to incentivize the use of Steemit, a new experiment in social media, has exploded in the past few days, taking third place after Ethereum, with a current market cap of more than $200 million, but can this actually work or is it just a fad?

<p>If 2015 was the year of the blockchain, perhaps 2016 will be the year of alternatives to Bitcoin. Since midway point 2015, the Bitcoin community has argued to no end about the future of the Bitcoin protocol. The core of the debate revolves around whether the software should be soft-forked or hard-forked, technical terminology relating to the way in which to implement a change to the way Bitcoin works.
