<p>By CCN: Charlie Lee can&#8217;t seem to shake his reputation for offloading his Litecoin holdings near the peak. The Litecoin creator was featured in a podcast with Morgan Creek Digital Partner Anthony Pompliano where he fielded some tough questions both about his LTC portfolio and the state of the crypto industry. Something that you might not know is when Charlie decided to sell his Litecoins when the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $300 he expected the price to go much higher.

Major crypto assets such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash spiked by 4 to 11 percent against the U.S. dollar. The unexpected recovery of the crypto market overnight comes after the office of the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against iFinex, alleging Bitfinex of mismanaging the cash reserves of stablecoin Tether. On April 30, as CCN reported, the general counsel of Tether stated in an affidavit that only 74 percent of Tether is </p>

<p>By CCN: It&#8217;s not easy being Charlie Lee. It&#8217;s no secret the Litecoin creator has had to deal with a crypto community that hasn&#8217;t gotten over his LTC portfolio sale. But he&#8217;s also fending off other blockchain projects, many of which have no place in the ecosystem to begin with. Lee took out his frustrations on Twitter, bemoaning the struggle to keep Litecoin in the limelight. &#8220;Watch Litecoin surviving the test of time. It&#8217;s not easy fighting off all the s**tcoins and scamcoins to stay in the top 10.&#8221; Litecoin is currently ranked as the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, though </p>

<p>By CCN: Crypto investors should do as Charlie Lee says, not as he does. The Litecoin creator was featured as a guest on Laura Shin&#8217;s Unchained podcast, where he defended his decision to liquidate the holdings of the cryptocurrency that he spawned, Litecoin (LTC). Lee, who is a Google alum, is a highly respected individual in the crypto community and his contribution to the ecosystem can&#8217;t be denied, as evidenced by a coin that has muscled its way into the six biggest cryptocurrencies. His decision to sell the cryptocurrency at year-end 2017 near the peak was simply bad PR. He </p>

<p>By CCN: The litecoin price has been one of the cryptocurrency market’s top performers in 2019, climbing a ridiculous 162 percent since the new year.

Novogratz, who is at the helm of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, blasts Litecoin&#8217;s size and in doing so seems to comes across as threatened by the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency. The Litecoin price has seen its value expand by 40% in April alone, gains that if you ask Novogratz would be better served by bitcoin.

After trading in the shadow of its larger sibling bitcoin (BTC) for so long, Litecoin, whose primary use case is &#8220;peer-t0-peer electronic cash,&#8221; is finally forging an identity of its own.

<p>Everyone knew a breakout was coming. A tight trading pattern lasted for weeks, which is almost always a precursor to big activity, one way or the other. In the case of Bitcoin and most everything else in the crypto market over the past 24-hours, things went very positive. Bears lost their stranglehold on the market and plenty of short positions were likely vaporized. Traders in recent weeks had become accustomed to movements of sometimes less than $100 in a whole day.
