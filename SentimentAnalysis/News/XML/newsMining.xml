				<description><![CDATA[<p>SBI Holdings, a major financial and banking giant in Japan, has formally announced the launch of SBI Mining Chip Co., Ltd., officially entering the bitcoin mining industry. In recent months, the most dominant forces in the global bitcoin mining industry in the likes of Bitmain, Cannan, and Japanese internet conglomerate GMO have struggled to adjust to market conditions. As the bitcoin bear market extended to a 15-month correction, despite the gradual increase in hash power, the demand for bitcoin mining due to the general decline in profitability of mining noticeably dropped. The entrance of SBI Holdings into the mining market </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Iran is in the middle of a bit of an economic crisis right now. Due to hiccups caused by the sanctions that were imposed by the United States government a while back, the government of Iran has had its hands full with merely keeping its economy afloat. Due to this, it would appear that the citizens are taking matters into their own hands. Having started using cryptocurrency for transactions with the rest of the world, they have now turned to Bitcoin mining as a means of making ends meet, according to a report on the Atlantic Council.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Iceland has long been a prominent hub of bitcoin mining due to 98% of its electricity coming from renewable geothermal energy and a cold climate favoring mining farms which must be kept cool can run massive air conditioning bills in warmer areas. The power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the country is as low as 1.03, almost twice as cost-effective as many nearby countries in continental Europe where the average is 1.78. As such, Iceland is home to international mining firms like Genesis and BitFury which have set up in the nation to capitalize on the natural advantages and now dwarf </p>

The built-in artificial scarcity is one of the most important characteristics of the currency, and the reason for the high price &#8211; Bitcoin is rare! Here is the way to think about Bitcoin.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Uncertainty in the cryptocurrency mining market has led to the world&#8217;s leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor, to lower its revenue forecast for the year. Adding insult to injury, weakness in demand for Apple&#8217;s iPhone, for which Taiwan Semi is the supplier, is also weighing on this year&#8217;s expected sales. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining was the champion of 2017, helping to drive Taiwan Semi&#8217;s 2017 revenue results higher by 6%, including a 10.1% increase in the fourth quarter alone. Now volatility in the bitcoin price, which has cut into miners&#8217; profits, is taking its toll. &#8220;For the whole year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, </p>

The perpetrator, Matthew McDemott, served as the information technology manager for the department, which overlooks the functioning of the citrus industry in Florida. The FDLE arrested McDermott shortly after the discovery and had him transported to Polk County jail. The cryptocurrency mining operation was discovered after an evaluation of the department’s utility bill amounts.

The post from the Windows Defender Research blog noted that the number of enterprise computers encountering unauthorized coin miners doubled from December to January 2018. Microsoft suggest that the reason for this rise is that cyber criminals are moving to this form of attack due to the exponential increase in cryptocurrency valuations. Along the way attackers are ditching ransom and other attacks, which have seen a marked fall. According to Microsoft, malicious coin mining can come in various forms and can be distributed in many different </p>

Equipment including components such as GPU&#8217;s, motherboards and fans, can be as much as 50% cheaper here than in Europe. At many locations, customers can also have their mining rigs assembled by sellers while they wait, and still pay less. One key destination is Hong Kong&#8217;s Sham Shui Po market, which is made even more attractive due to the lack of sales tax. However, the boom in sales is being felt across Asia &#8211; a welcome respite. Sales had been falling in recent </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia just had an earnings call this month, and the company had posted better than expected results, due to which the stock prices shot up above $240. Goldman Sachs had predicted a successful quarter for Nvidia last month. GPU mining has been the driving force for Nvidia lately because of the popularity of their cards among miners. Last year, when the cryptocurrency market exploded, it became extremely lucrative to set up GPU-Based mining for currencies like Ethereum and ZCash. With the increase in price for Ethereum and it’s general difficulty, the ROI is usually less than six months. There’s so </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>AMD has announced plans to boost its production of graphics cards amid a global shortage with demand for them driven by their use in mining cryptocurrencies. AMD released earnings for Q4 2017 on Tuesday, announcing revenues of $1.48 billion, a 34 percent year-on-year increase. Of that total revenue, the company’s Computing and Graphics division contributed $958 million, up 60 percent from the same quarter in 2016. Demand for GPU processing power has surged due to a spike in interest from the blockchain and cryptocurrency community. In an investor call, AMD CEO and president Dr Lisa Su told investors that the </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Nvidia, the company that has long catered to gamers, has recently requested retailers to restrict graphics cards availability to the non-gaming community. Specifically, away from cryptocurrency miners. According to ComputerBase, Nvidia&#8217;s spokesperson Boris Böhles stated that gamers will always be their priority, &#8220;For NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are focused on our main audience. To ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers&#8217; needs as usual.&#8221; In advising retailers to control their sales, </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a submitted sponsored story. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below. The process of crypto mining requires large amounts of energy.   For example, in the case of bitcoins, a research done by PowerCompare shows that electricity used to mine it in 2017 is much bigger than the annual usage of 159 countries. There is a great concern about what the environmental impact would be from all this electrical usage. Most of this electricity is generated from Carbon dioxide fossil fuels. Large amounts of energy </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than 159 individual countries including ireland, a new report by CBS revealed. In contrary to most claims, bitcoin’s massive consumption of electricity is a positive aspect of the cryptocurrency, as it provides more security value to the network. Proof-of-Work is Important For Bitcoin Earlier this year, in a response to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s baseless condemnation on bitcoin, security expert John McAfee stated on CNBC’s Fast Money that bitcoin is a better store of value and a currency than all fiat currencies including the US dollar, because of its decentralized nature and the resources </p>

There’s a very high-level of knowledge about it here, and a high-level of digital competence in the Fintech space. We may not be the size of Hong Kong or London, but it’s hard to find that level of digital competence in other financial centres,” said Bogusz. Will Sweden Become the Next Cryptocurrency Mining Hub?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Several sources including the Wall Street Journal have reported that the Chinese government and its regulators may target bitcoin mining operators in the region following the imposition of a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency and bitcoin exchanges. Experts in the cryptocurrency sector and mining industry including John McAfee strongly believe that the Chinese government will not order a crackdown on bitcoin mining centers and operators. As Cryptocoinsnews previously reported, McAfee revealed that Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitmain, the world’s largest bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer that is reportedly valued at billions of dollars, told McAfee in a meeting with Roger Ver </p>

Maxwell states: “Due to a design oversight the Bitcoin proof of work function has a potential attack which can allow an attacking miner to save up-to 30% of their energy costs (though closer to 20% is more likely due to implementation overheads).” It’s not clear what Maxwell means by “design oversight.” It could simply be the fact that proof of work allows for the use of specialized software which can be optimized leading to an arms </p>
