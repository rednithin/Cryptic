In an interview with CNBC, the LSE chief executive Nikhil Rathi said he was inspired by early blockchain initiatives at other stock exchanges, and sees the benefit of distributed ledger technology: “You can certainly see distributed ledger technology having an application in the issuance process… I can see that technology being used in settlement too.” LSE, the world’s sixth-largest exchange, has been surprisingly open to blockchain technology.

That’s in addition to the 22 percent who report their firms have already implemented the technology. This marks a dramatic change from only a year ago, when blockchain was more talked about than practiced, according to Chris Stephenson, Business Consulting principal at Grant Thornton LLP and author of the report. In its 2019 CFO Survey, Grant Thornton along with partner CFO Research surveyed 378 senior finance executives in </p>

They also claim there are systemic risks to conventional finance from the adoption of the tech. Moody&#8217;s Is Concerned About &#8220;Concentrated Risk&#8221; When Using Blockchain Yes, you heard that correctly. Moody’s angle is not that blockchain technology is displacing and disrupting archaic financial systems.

Republican state representative Rick Carfagna sponsored the bill. The legislation, called House Bill 220, is part of Ohio&#8217;s plan to provide a legal framework for distributed ledger technology such as blockchain (see text below). Rep.

The market may be showing some positive signs as bitcoin, ethereum and others made strong gains in April, but the bear market continues to show its teeth, claiming the scalp of another start-up. Sirin Labs, founded by Israeli businessman Moshe Hogeg, first announced the $1,000 smartphone back in July.

Fogo de Chao revealed it will integrate blockchain technology to monitor the meat it serves from farm to table. In doing so, the restaurant is helping to catapult the cattle ranching business into the high-tech arena. Cattle ranchers gain a window into the health and behavior of their animals. Restaurants can track where the meat came from. And consumers can see the history of the animal&#8217;s life on a &#8220;semi-public&#8221; network using their smartphone.

He explains that it is essentially a fork of Ethereum which integrated a lot of privacy-focused changes and primarily focuses on cross-chain compatibility. Wanchain wants to be the bridge between blockchains, allowing multi-crypto transaction execution in a private manner. Officially, in text, it describes itself as “the world’s first and only interoperable blockchain with secure multi-party computation.” Wanchain layman might think of it like Ethereum + Monero with a hint of ShapeShift.
