				<description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto heavyweight Circle stated in a blog post that their OTC (Over-the-counter) business has facilitated over $24 Billion worth of trades. This is a huge number given that OTC trading volumes are not reported publicly and there have been growing discussions about institutional investor activity over crypto OTC desks. Circle Trade has become a core liquidity provider to the entire crypto ecosystem Circle claimed that over 600 counter parties executed over 10,000 trades over 2018. These trades spanned over 36 assets, and primary consumers of the desk include miners, founders, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, crypto funds, and VC&#8217;s. Circle Trade, </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>As we previously reported, Circle’s Poloniex participation in the stablecoin wars is evident in their decision to not charge fees on use of USDC on their platform. For the month of November, trades in USDC were not charged any fees at all. According to an e-mail blast from Poloniex, this amounted to more than $500,000 in trading fees not accrued by them. Now they’ve decided to extend the fee holiday through December on BTC/USDC, a pair that is undoubtedly hot given the price situation with Bitcoin. Some are trying to exit and some are trying to enter, and a newfound </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitfinex has announced a new financial instrument on its platform in response to the upcoming hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Noting a sizable increase in short bets on BCH – traders apparently believing that the split will have a negative impact on the per-coin price of Bitcoin Cash – Bitfinex has created something called the Chain Split Token. To prevent any risk of manipulation and hence to maintain a healthy market we have decided to use the Chain Split Tokens (CST) approach to govern this particular event. This is a slightly different approach to the situation than Poloniex </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>If you want to trade Bytecoin on Poloniex, you’re going to have to wait a significant amount of time, CCN has learned. This reporter decided to enter the BCH pre-fork trading at the exchange and wanted to use his Bytecoin holdings as part of that process. He withdrew them from where they were held and properly made the deposit, using the payment ID required by Poloniex and paying the requisite transaction fees. Hours after other deposits had cleared and coins had been converted to pre-fork BCHABC and BCHSV tokens, the Bytecoin had still not arrived. In Bytecoin standard transactions, 10 </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Poloniex, one of the major altcoin exchanges, was acquired by Circle in February. Previously, Circle was focused primarily on the major coins versus fiat pairings, but since its acquisition of Poloniex it has had the opportunity to dive into more tokens, and in September it launched its own stablecoin to compete with tether (USDT) and the Gemini Dollar (GUSD), which was launched around the same time. The purpose of “stablecoins” is to help traders denominate their cryptos without creating a crypto-to-fiat event as well as to have coins that are pegged with some degree of </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Poloniex, one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the global market, has become a major digital asset trading platform once again after years of stagnation. Until 2015, Poloniex was one of the largest crypto exchanges alongside Coinbase. It was the go-to exchange for traders investing in smaller trading pairs like tokens and alternative cryptocurrencies. But, controversy around the legitimacy of the exchange and the operating team of Poloniex led the platform lose out in tight competition, falling behind Bittrex, Bitfinex, Binance, OKEx, Huobi, HitBTC, and many other major cryptocurrency exchanges.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>US-based cryptocurrency-only exchange Poloniex is pushing legacy customers to comply with updated customer identification requirements. Among the earliest crypto-only exchanges, Poloniex is mandating new customer identification and verification requirements upon legacy account holders as the platform pledges its commitment to complying with all relevant laws as a registered money services firm. The firm also has a deadline, to be announced sometime in Q1 2018, beyond which legacy accounts that haven’t complied with the updated verification requirements will effectively be disabled. The long-running exchange stopped short of revealing the number of legacy accounts currently in use. Presumably, the new requirements are </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent report published by cybersecurity firm ESET, two malicious Android apps were recently removed from the Google Play store, as these were made to look like the official app of popular cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex in an attempt to obtain user credentials and, presumably, steal funds. The apps, in what was essentially a phishing scam, took advantage of Poloniex not having an official mobile application and having a mobile optimized website. They used Poloniex’s logo and visual identity to fake being an official app, and once credentials were stolen they merely redirected users to the exchange’s mobile website. </p>

Giving away lumens for free is an invitation to communities to design the services they need.  To expand the reach of the network. The availability and active use of lumens on the network will increase the network’s utility by many orders of magnitude. However, when they announced the program earlier this year, they said </p>

As a result, according to a class-action lawsuit soon to be filed in Florida, almost a million bucks was lost at Kraken alone. At the time, Kraken put out a statement indicating that it could not make a habit of reimbursing users who suffered during “the outcome of naturally occurring events in the market, nor losses due to unavoidable DDoS attacks.” Silver Law Group, a firm which operates in </p>

The apparent downward momentum combined with numerous sustained technical problems at Poloniex led to a number of long margin Ethereum traders having their positions destroyed. The owner of the site, whose ownership information is protected by WhoisGuard, claims to have lost around $250,000 due to the madness.

Just before the site became inaccessible, there was a large ETH sell order, according to Kraken, which “triggered a cascade of liquidations.” Kraken says they have investigated the incident and they concluded that there was no “evidence of a coordinated attack or market manipulation.” They say the timing of the DDoS and the large sell order appears to just be a coincidence. Traders suffered heavy losses because ETG&#8217;s price went from around $90 to a bottom </p>

The platform provides tools to create customized prediction market applications for individuals and enterprises alike.
