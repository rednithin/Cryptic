Following a series of raids in both Germany and the United States, American and European officials have succeeded in taking down what they call one of the world’s “largest online criminal trafficking operations.” The problem is it took authorities two years to take down the bad guys, paving the way for millions in crypto funds to be stolen in the interim. Three German citizens – who remain unnamed at press time – have been charged in both their home country and the United States with </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The bitcoin price surged as much as 7.60-percent on Friday to establish a new 2019 peak at $5,796.93. The uptrend pushed bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date rally to an impressive 54.08-percent. At the same time, it brought the asset&#8217;s total recovery to an astounding 82-percent and set the cryptocurrency well on its way to a fresh record high. Here are three factors that indicate the bitcoin price has not only found a bottom but is also well on its way to smashing through the $20,000 peak it set in late 2017.

Speaking during a Bitcoin Wednesday event in Amsterdam, the Bitcoin SV figurehead indicated that the only reason he outed himself as Satoshi Nakamoto was to right what had gone wrong with his alleged creation: &#8220;Part of why I f*cking disappeared was to have things not controlled, and I have to come back to control things, to get it f*cking not controlled, that’s the freaking irony </p>

In a tweet referencing an article in which he was mentioned as one of cryptocurrency personalities who have made bold price predictions, McAfee warned that anyone who had been planning to purchase a ‘front row seat’ to watch him eat his penis is unlikely to get their wish fulfilled. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: The bitcoin bear market of 2018 was a disaster for most crypto fans, but it was a boon for the highly-anticipated cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt. That&#8217;s the opinion of NYSE chairman Jeffrey Sprecher, the CEO of Bakkt&#8217;s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Sprecher’s ICE — along with Microsoft, Starbucks, and BCG — is bankrolling Bakkt, whose CEO is Sprecher’s wife, Kelly Loeffler. sprecher: bitcoin winter was good for bakkt Sprecher tried to put a positive spin on the Crypto Winter by saying it gave Bakkt time to build out the platform and buy up bitcoin at relatively cheap </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Where&#8217;s Satoshi? Henry Ford fathered the auto industry, and Steve Jobs launched a cultural obsession with smartphones. Yet the crypto industry, now at $170 billion, doesn’t know who fathered Bitcoin. A new website is making the rounds on the social web, stoking speculation about what it could mean for the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto. Gotsatoshi.com launched around this past weekend with no hint as to who built the site, or what it’s for. The only clues are a ticking clock and promise of a &#8220;live unveiling.&#8221; Is this a hoax, or an epic unmasking? Let’s break down some theories. </p>
