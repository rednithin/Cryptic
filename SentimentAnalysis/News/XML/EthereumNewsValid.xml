				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Ethereum’s status as a legitimate transactional currency was confirmed once again this week &#8211; by none other than the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC’s recent lawsuit against Kik (KIN) details the particulars of the KIN token sale &#8211; the public phase of which was carried out against ETH, as opposed to the U.S dollar. Throughout the official court document, the SEC appears to accept Ethereum as legitimate legal tender. This adds to similar noises made by the regulatory body in 2018, when SEC officials said Bitcoin and Ethereum were clearly not securities. Ethereum: Definitely Not a Three-Dollar </p>

That&#8217;s the decision from Israel&#8217;s Supreme Court on Monday. It overturned a district court&#8217;s earlier decision to allow Bank Leumi to close the Israeli crypto exchange&#8217;s account. Bits of Gold&#8217;s Second Court Victory This isn&#8217;t the first time Bits of Gold has run into trouble with Bank Leumi; neither is it the first time Israel&#8217;s courts have sided with the crypto exchange over the big bank.

The Ethereum co-founder also gave his thoughts on decentralized exchanges and the worryingly centralized accumulation of power by Binance. Ethereum Co-Founder: Bitcoin SV is a &#8216;Complete Scam&#8217; Just in case there was any doubt remaining about Buterin’s thoughts on Bitcoin SV, he told Hardcore Crypto: “Obviously BSV is a complete scam, but the delisting from Binance &#8211; that was interesting. </p>

In the glory days of the ICO run, when transaction fees were high &#8211; and demand for Ether was also high &#8211; the ETH price sailed over $1,000. What are the odds of that happening now, or soon? Ethereum: Can ETH Join Bitcoin in Four-Figure Territory? Ethereum has faced stiff competition from other smart contract platforms, notably Tron and EOS. In the “enterprise” space, there are also several competitors, including NEO, Aelf, and more.

The most recent sale ended for 415.9 Ether – nearly $110,000 at current prices. The car sold is a one-of-a-kind.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper is one of the biggest advocates of the cryptocurrency space. He is famous for his bullish $250,000 bitcoin price prediction, which would reflect a 5% market share around the world in the coming years. Draper supports competition in the space and in addition to bitcoin is also a fan of smart contract technology, other blockchains including Ethereum, artificial intelligence, and big data. But something he reportedly takes an issue with is Ethereum economics, particularly the issuance of between 2% and 4% of ETH supply each year. In an interview with Ethereum Classic Labs, </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Ethereum price(ETH) has depreciated more than 10-percent against the US dollar as the global cryptocurrency market undergoes a massive correction. The ETH-to-dollar dropped to $235.44 on Coinbase as on May 30, 2100, UTC after rallying for five weeks consecutively. The pair attempted a small pullback from its newfound intraday low, but could not extend it to cover the intraday losses. The price action, overall, appeared weak, indicating that Ethereum could continue its plunge to test new downside targets. Ahead of the correction, the Ethereum price established its year-to-date peak at $288.77 on Coinbase. However, the level experienced a huge </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; By CCN: CryptoKitties, a smart contract-fueled decentralized app (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, was supposed to be the one to jumpstart mainstream adoption of crypto. You know, kind of like the Mario Bros of crypto, but instead of Luigi and Mario, there are digital cats. After all, it was the app to clog the Ethereum blockchain, causing a bottleneck from the game&#8217;s popularity that slowed transactions to a snail&#8217;s pace. Nonetheless, the crypto ecosystem is still waiting for that one &#8216;killer app&#8217; now that CryptoKitties and other promising dApps failed to gain scale. The digital collectibles are worth </p>

These three cryptocurrencies are showing unbelievable strength, and they are not getting the attention they deserve.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The Ethereum Foundation announced it is committing $30 million over 12 months as it continues to build Ethereum 2.0.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The crypto ecosystem often explores which blockchain will emerge as the &#8216;Ethereum killer.&#8217; So far, no network has been able to muscle the second-biggest blockchain off its perch, but now there&#8217;s a new kid in town – Ava, and it has Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Visa in its sights. Ava is a new cryptocurrency that uses a consensus protocol known as Avalanche, whose creators similar to Bitcoin are anonymous only they go by Team Rocket. Avalanche is designed to combine the &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; from the Nakamoto Consensus and Classical Consensus, according to Cornell University Associate Professor Emin </p>

What you might not know is that he dislikes Ethereum and doesn’t even care that much for BTC, either. Yes, the reason is as silly as you might have hoped. Meanwhile, similar to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, McAfee has a soft spot for meme-fueled cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Folks asking my opinion of Ethereum: Well . . ..

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Bitcoin&#8217;s breathtaking rally has dominated the headlines in recent weeks, but today it&#8217;s the second-largest cryptocurrency&#8217;s turn to enjoy the spotlight. The ethereum price surged as high as $281.77 on Thursday, launching ETH to an eight-month high. Ethereum Price Finally Joins the Crypto Party The cryptocurrency asset witnessed massive capital influx into its market when its frontrunner bitcoin began to correct from its overbought territory. The inverse correlation signified that bitcoin investors were hedging into the ether market, a theory further validated by ETH&#8217;s 16% appreciation against bitcoin in the last 24 hours, as shown in the chart </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Nvidia previously blamed its negative earnings report on “crypto winter,” the vaunted extended bear market which Bitcoin appears to have finally exited. The incredible rally of the past couple weeks means many industries related to crypto will see increased demand and valuation – everything from mining to software development will be in fashion again. However, NVDA shareholders should not count on another cryptocurrency boom to rescue the ailing chipmaker. Analysts Worry about Nvidia as Stock Implodes Nvidia stock continues to teeter on the brink, and the company&#8217;s first-quarter earnings report isn’t looking very healthy, according to Wall Street </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: It has been almost a year and a half since bears took over crypto markets. Bitcoin took a massive beating as it shed 84% of its value. Other large-cap coins shared more brutal fates. Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS were all devalued by more than 90%. Last year was full of trials and tribulations for retail investors. Thankfully, the ordeal is finally over. With bitcoin’s unbelievable run over the last few days, altcoins such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and EOS have responded with massive technical breakouts. This prompted us to declare that the crypto winter of 2018 is now behind </p>

For comparison the company says 448 people own 20 percent of all Bitcoin. The study also looked at the effect that cryptocurrency &#8220;whales,&#8221; with out-sized stakes in the limited supply of highly sought after coins, have on Ether prices. They found the effect of whales on Ether&#8217;s price is minimal. Chainalysis senior economist Kim Grauer says: &#8220;The majority of whales aren’t traders.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The price of Ethereum (ETH) has surged by nine percent against the U.S. dollar in the past 24 hours following the 38 percent rally of bitcoin in the past 30 days. The recovery of Ethereum was somewhat expected by traders as the asset demonstrated a lackluster performance in the first quarter of 2019. While the bitcoin price recorded a staggering 110 percent gain against the U.S. dollar year-to-date, prior to its recent nine percent spike, Ethereum was up about 51 percent from $136 to $206.
