In an interview with Finder, Wright accused Binance of engaging in wash trading and money laundering: You have things like CZ (Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO) there and Binance which is super bucket shop which are basically money laundering organizations. They wash trades and money laundering. That’s how they make money. Additionally, Wright also alleged that the leading cryptocurrency exchange engages in market manipulation.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a megalomaniac who&#8217;s launching blockchain and cryptocurrency projects in order to squeeze crypto companies out of the dominance he eventually wants to assert over the space. That&#8217;s the opinion of Binance CFO Wei Zhou. Misguided bitcoin evangelists have been heaping praise on Facebook for experimenting with blockchain and for saying it might launch its own digital currency. They believe that having a massive multinational conglomerate like Facebook test out use cases for blockchain is lending legitimacy to the nascent industry. However, Zhou — a former Harvard classmate of the Facebook chairman — says </p>

According to OnChainFX, BNB was the only crypto asset to achieve an all-time high this year since 2017 and it is down about 9 percent from its record high.

BNB hit a new all-time high a few days ago and the exchange successfully launched Binance chain, which features BNB and marks the coin&#8217;s independence from Ethereum. The cryptosphere has been filled with noises about BNB possibly being the new &#8220;Ethereum killer.&#8221; Weiss Ratings took the conversation a step further, suggesting that BNB might even be the new bitcoin.

You’d have to travel far and wide to find anyone gullible enough to defend Craig Wright at this point, but there’s a case to be made that by delisting BSV on a whim, Binance has shown itself to be a much more dangerous and pernicious force in the crypto space than Bitcoin SV ever could have been.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Vitalik Buterin is known first and foremost as the creator of Ethereum, but he&#8217;s also famous for his disdain of centralized exchanges. After previously wishing that centralized exchanges would all &#8220;burn in hell&#8221;, now Buterin is coming to their defense. In an exposition reminding the crypto community about the pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Buterin tackles one of the most controversial issue dominating crypto at the moment &#8212; Craig Wright and his brainchild Bitcoin SV. &#8220;I personally have been a critic of the power wielded by centralized exchanges. Should I oppose #DelistBSV on free speech </p>

People with deep pockets have seized the opportunity to throw their money around, and Binance refuses to miss a marketing opportunity. The exchange has an ongoing campaign to raise donations from the crypto public and its users – either anonymously or not. Unfortunately, the anonymous option doesn’t come with the ability to send privacy coins. Only Bitcoin, Binance Coin, and Ethereum are accepted for donations. French government may accept bitcoin donations. CZ is on it The French government is looking into accepting crypto, Bloomberg reports, but the </p>

Possibly due to the general improvement in sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency market, Binance has recorded a relatively large profit in the first quarter of 2019. According to the estimates published by The Block, Binance generated a profit of over $78 million in the first quarter of 2019, up 66 percent from the first quarter of 2018.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: In case there was any doubt, the bitcoin price has found a bottom. Binance has released a comprehensive research report on the state of the crypto market, finding that the worst for crypto is probably over, which suggests it&#8217;s onward and upward for prices from here. That’s good news for investors and everyone who would like to see blockchain technology take off. &#8220;Having emerged from a period of the highest internal correlations in crypto history, the data may support the notion that the cryptomarket has already bottomed out,&#8221; the Binance report states.

While the official note on the subject offers no justification or reasoning, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith posted a few Tweets earlier today which indicate the philosophical drive for the decision: At @blockchain, we added support for close out only transactions (sell, send) for #BSV in January in the @blockchain Wallet and have encouraged users to sell or take their #BSV elsewhere&#8230; &#8212; Peter Smith (@OneMorePeter) April 15, 2019 In the next thirty days, we will end even close out support for #BSV transactions.

Withdrawals must be made from the platform by July 22nd, according to an official post. The reasons cited by Binance are “officious” in nature, but the community is fully aware this is related to Chenpeng Zhao’s annoyance at the antics of Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, the most notable proponents of Bitcoin SV. Officially, the exchange lists several possible factors: Commitment of team to project Level and quality of development activity Network </p>

It&#8217;s a blow to Craig Wright and a reflection of the animosity that has been building against the controversial creator of the cryptocurrency. Wright has been at odds with the vast majority crypto community on Twitter, threatening to pursue legal action toward people calling him a fraud. Incidentally, CZ is in the camp that Craig Wright is a fraud, adding to Binance&#8217;s decision to delist the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, CZ already hinted that he was getting tired of Wright&#8217;s attacks </p>

Craig Wright, the driving force behind cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV, has long claimed he is the founder of bitcoin and the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  Master piece! You have my full support, Peter. To be clear, I don&#39;t choose sides on technology. We let market do that. I am against fraud, such as lying to be someone. As such, it is my strong opinion that: Craig Wright is fraud. https://t.co/f9ihSD6Pr3 &#8212; CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 15, 2019 This isn’t the first </p>
