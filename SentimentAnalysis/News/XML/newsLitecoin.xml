				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Charlie Lee can&#8217;t seem to shake his reputation for offloading his Litecoin holdings near the peak. The Litecoin creator was featured in a podcast with Morgan Creek Digital Partner Anthony Pompliano where he fielded some tough questions both about his LTC portfolio and the state of the crypto industry. Something that you might not know is when Charlie decided to sell his Litecoins when the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $300 he expected the price to go much higher. He said on the podcast: &#8220;I actually personally did think it was going to keep going up. I didn&#8217;t </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: The bitcoin price has increased from $5,173 to $5,297 on major regulated crypto exchanges including Coinbase in the past 24 hours, by 2.3 percent. Major crypto assets such as Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash spiked by 4 to 11 percent against the U.S. dollar. The unexpected recovery of the crypto market overnight comes after the office of the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against iFinex, alleging Bitfinex of mismanaging the cash reserves of stablecoin Tether. On April 30, as CCN reported, the general counsel of Tether stated in an affidavit that only 74 percent of Tether is </p>

It&#8217;s no secret the Litecoin creator has had to deal with a crypto community that hasn&#8217;t gotten over his LTC portfolio sale. But he&#8217;s also fending off other blockchain projects, many of which have no place in the ecosystem to begin with. Lee took out his frustrations on Twitter, bemoaning the struggle to keep Litecoin in the limelight. &#8220;Watch Litecoin surviving the test of time. It&#8217;s not easy fighting off all the s**tcoins and scamcoins to stay in the top 10.&#8221; Litecoin is currently ranked as the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, though </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Crypto investors should do as Charlie Lee says, not as he does. The Litecoin creator was featured as a guest on Laura Shin&#8217;s Unchained podcast, where he defended his decision to liquidate the holdings of the cryptocurrency that he spawned, Litecoin (LTC). Lee, who is a Google alum, is a highly respected individual in the crypto community and his contribution to the ecosystem can&#8217;t be denied, as evidenced by a coin that has muscled its way into the six biggest cryptocurrencies. His decision to sell the cryptocurrency at year-end 2017 near the peak was simply bad PR. He </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The litecoin price has been one of the cryptocurrency market’s top performers in 2019, climbing a ridiculous 162 percent since the new year. Among large-cap cryptoassets, only binance coin has performed better, and litecoin’s year-to-date rally leaves the bitcoin price’s 40 percent advance in the dust. However, one team of crypto analysts says the sixth-largest cryptocurrency looks poised for a sell-off. Litecoin Price Likely to Crash Through Support &#8211; And That’s OK! Writing in a note to clients on Wednesday, crypto brokerage BitOoda said that a downward wedge has begun to form on the litecoin chart, suggesting that </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Crypto trader Mike Novogratz fails to see the value in Litecoin. Novogratz, who is at the helm of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, blasts Litecoin&#8217;s size and in doing so seems to comes across as threatened by the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency. The Litecoin price has seen its value expand by 40% in April alone, gains that if you ask Novogratz would be better served by bitcoin. The former Fortress hedge fund manager capitalized on Litecoin&#8217;s reputation as being digital silver to bitcoin&#8217;s gold, comparing the size of the respective precious metal and crypto markets. While silver&#8217;s market cap is </p>

What started as a bitcoin rally later transformed into an altcoin-fest when bitcoin cash and litecoin began to posting winning numbers. While bitcoin cash surged from $168.50 to as high as $336.62, litecoin ballooned to almost twice its April 2 valuation, rising from $61 to a session high at $94.48.

Meanwhile, a handful of crypto assets and tokens recorded gains in the range of 5 to 30 percent. Polymath, the best performing crypto asset on the day, recorded a 31 percent gain against the U.S. dollar, with most of the volume coming from Upbit, a major cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. As seen in the chart of Polymath below, most alternative cryptocurrencies and tokens remain down about 90 percent down from their all-time highs </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The broader crypto market has been stuck in a narrow trading range over the short-term, but there&#8217;s one cryptocurrency whose value has nearly doubled year-to-date, and that&#8217;s Litecoin (LTC). The fifth-biggest coin, which is currently trading at $60.75, has benefitted from a few high-profile partnerships inked by Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, not to mention a push toward confidential transactions. After trading in the shadow of its larger sibling bitcoin (BTC) for so long, Litecoin, whose primary use case is &#8220;peer-t0-peer electronic cash,&#8221; is finally forging an identity of its own. Cryptocurrency prime dealer SFOX outlined five catalysts that have driven </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Within minutes, Litecoin (LTC), the fifth most valuable asset in the global crypto market, surged by 10 percent against the U.S. dollar. The sudden short-term rally of Litecoin was followed by the recovery of Bitcoin from around $3,700 to $3,868. Bitcoin is en route to breaching the $3,900 resistance level once again after defending the $3,700 mark with relative ease. What’s Behind the Litecoin Rally and Can Bitcoin Sustain Momentum? According to many traders, the recent price movement of Litecoin was more technical than fundamental. For the first time since July, Litecoin broke out of a key resistance level above </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Tether announced today that it’s issuing USDT on the TRON blockchain. As Tether writes in its own blog post on the subject: The TRC20-based USDT enables interoperability with TRON-based protocols and Decentralised Applications (dApps) whilst allowing users to transact and exchange fiat pegged currencies across the TRON Network. TRON is only the third blockchain on which Tether has issued its stablecoin. Late last year, various actions by Tether Limited got people thinking that maybe the company was exiting the market altogether.

Crypto assets that have outperformed both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar throughout February in the likes of EOS and Litecoin recorded 4 to 6 percent gains in the past 24 hours, showing strong momentum. Litecoin, in particular, demonstrated a spectacular rally from $33 to $50, gaining 51.5 percent in less than three weeks.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>In the past two months, several traders who shorted Bitcoin from its all-time high at $20,000 have started to cash out in the $3,000 to $4,000 range. The closure of several long-term Bitcoin short contracts followed the publicized cash out of former International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist Mark Dow’s short contract on Bitcoin in December. Speaking to Bloomberg, on Dec 18, 2018, Dow said: I’m done. I don’t want to try to ride this thing to zero. I don’t want to try to squeeze more out of the lemon. I don’t want to think about it.

The valuation of the cryptocurrency market increased from $110 billion to $120 billion, by just over $10 billion. Following the strong corrective rally of Bitcoin, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz stated that every major macro fund should hold at least 1 percent of their portfolios in Bitcoin.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knew a breakout was coming. A tight trading pattern lasted for weeks, which is almost always a precursor to big activity, one way or the other. In the case of Bitcoin and most everything else in the crypto market over the past 24-hours, things went very positive. Bears lost their stranglehold on the market and plenty of short positions were likely vaporized. Traders in recent weeks had become accustomed to movements of sometimes less than $100 in a whole day. Like as not, plenty of positions were primed for movements of that size. But virtually every market saw Bitcoin </p>
