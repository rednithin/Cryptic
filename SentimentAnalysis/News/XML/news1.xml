This is because the 2020 U.S. presidential candidate still stands by his prediction that bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 by the end of next year. In a tweet referencing an article in which he was mentioned as one of cryptocurrency personalities who have made bold price predictions, McAfee warned that anyone who had been planning to purchase a ‘front row seat’ to watch him eat his penis is unlikely to get their wish fulfilled. </p>

That&#8217;s the opinion of NYSE chairman Jeffrey Sprecher, the CEO of Bakkt&#8217;s parent company, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Sprecher’s ICE — along with Microsoft, Starbucks, and BCG — is bankrolling Bakkt, whose CEO is Sprecher’s wife, Kelly Loeffler. sprecher: bitcoin winter was good for bakkt Sprecher tried to put a positive spin on the Crypto Winter by saying it gave Bakkt time to build out the platform and buy up bitcoin at relatively cheap </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Where&#8217;s Satoshi? Henry Ford fathered the auto industry, and Steve Jobs launched a cultural obsession with smartphones. Yet the crypto industry, now at $170 billion, doesn’t know who fathered Bitcoin. A new website is making the rounds on the social web, stoking speculation about what it could mean for the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto. Gotsatoshi.com launched around this past weekend with no hint as to who built the site, or what it’s for. The only clues are a ticking clock and promise of a &#8220;live unveiling.&#8221; Is this a hoax, or an epic unmasking? Let’s break down some theories. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has announced plans to enter Dubai’s real estate market. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is surprisingly eyeing an expansion into Dubai at a time when the region&#8217;s real estate market is slumping. Boom and Bust Cycles Ever since the oil slump of 2014, Dubai&#8217;s economy never fully recovered. Prices have reportedly fallen by 25% in recent years and remain sluggish. Their main driving force, expatriates, started leaving the country in search of greener pastures as businesses closed shop. The gap they left in the real estate market caused values to decrease significantly. Worse, 31,500 homes </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The crypto community hasn&#8217;t scared Mark Zuckerberg away from his cryptocurrency ambitions, at least not yet. New details have emerged in a Wall Street Journal report indicating that Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s company is actively looking to ink deals to back its cryptocurrency payments ecosystem. Facebook is reportedly in discussions with &#8220;dozens of financial firms and online merchants&#8221; to support the unveiling of its blockchain-based payments network. Facebook is looking to lasso $1 billion for its new cryptocurrency and has been in talks with some major players.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: If you think today&#8217;s stock market declines were ugly, things could be about to get worse. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&#38;P 500 indexes managed to bounce off their lows of the day, they still ended in the red. Worse, the sentiment seems to have shifted from one of optimism and record highs to selling fueled by fears of what the Fed will or won&#8217;t do. And if you ask one market strategist, you haven&#8217;t seen anything yet. Cornerstone Macro Chief Investment Strategist Michael Kantrowitz told CNBC that the stock market could be due for a </p>

Those banned included InfoWars founder Alex Jones and InfoWars lieutenant Paul Joseph Watson. Also booted were Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Louis Farrakhan. In a statement, the company explained: &#8220;We’ve always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.&#8221; Of course, it&#8217;s probably very easy for </p>

The Fortnite creator is desperate for exclusives to prop up its Epic Games Store against Steam. Flush with cash after Fortnite&#8217;s jaw-dropping success, they have claimed one of the shining jewels of the esports movement. Despite Psyonix alleging they won&#8217;t leave Steam users out in the cold, it seems inevitable that winter is coming for Rocket League’s original community.

A day after Grayscale unleashed its &#8220;Drop Gold promotion, a TV commercial that garnered 100,000 views in less than 24 hours, the World Gold Council is clapping back. Gold&#8217;s reputation as a store of value has gone pretty much uncontested for thousands of years – until bitcoin, which has earned the reputation as digital gold in addition to its use case as a currency.

Financial advisors (74%) and family offices (80%) view the characteristics of digital assets most favorably.&#8221; We asked: what do institutions really think about #digitalassets? https://t.co/3Lq5h5ITbT &#8212; </p>

Bitcoin revenue nearly doubled to $65.5 million from $34 million in the year-ago period. Cash App volume, where the company boasts &#8220;15 million monthly active users,&#8221; expanded more than 100% since last year&#8217;s Q1. Square&#8217;s bitcoin revenue has been steadily increasing since Q1 2018, during a bear market no less.
