				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The bitcoin price surged as much as 7.60-percent on Friday to establish a new 2019 peak at $5,796.93. The uptrend pushed bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date rally to an impressive 54.08-percent. At the same time, it brought the asset&#8217;s total recovery to an astounding 82-percent and set the cryptocurrency well on its way to a fresh record high. Here are three factors that indicate the bitcoin price has not only found a bottom but is also well on its way to smashing through the $20,000 peak it set in late 2017.

Speaking during a Bitcoin Wednesday event in Amsterdam, the Bitcoin SV figurehead indicated that the only reason he outed himself as Satoshi Nakamoto was to right what had gone wrong with his alleged creation: &#8220;Part of why I f*cking disappeared was to have things not controlled, and I have to come back to control things, to get it f*cking not controlled, that’s the freaking irony </p>

This is because the 2020 U.S. presidential candidate still stands by his prediction that bitcoin will reach $1,000,000 by the end of next year. In a tweet referencing an article in which he was mentioned as one of cryptocurrency personalities who have made bold price predictions, McAfee warned that anyone who had been planning to purchase a ‘front row seat’ to watch him eat his penis is unlikely to get their wish fulfilled. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Where&#8217;s Satoshi? Henry Ford fathered the auto industry, and Steve Jobs launched a cultural obsession with smartphones. Yet the crypto industry, now at $170 billion, doesn’t know who fathered Bitcoin. A new website is making the rounds on the social web, stoking speculation about what it could mean for the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto. Gotsatoshi.com launched around this past weekend with no hint as to who built the site, or what it’s for. The only clues are a ticking clock and promise of a &#8220;live unveiling.&#8221; Is this a hoax, or an epic unmasking? Let’s break down some theories. </p>

The research read: &#8220;Nearly half of respondents (47%) appreciate that digital assets are an innovative technology play. 46% find digital assets’ low correlation to other assets among the most appealing characteristic. Financial advisors (74%) and family offices (80%) view the characteristics of digital assets most favorably.&#8221; We asked: what do institutions really think about #digitalassets? https://t.co/3Lq5h5ITbT &#8212; </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Square might have had a mixed first quarter performance, but the Cash App, which is where investors buy and sell bitcoin, was a bright spot. Bitcoin revenue nearly doubled to $65.5 million from $34 million in the year-ago period. Cash App volume, where the company boasts &#8220;15 million monthly active users,&#8221; expanded more than 100% since last year&#8217;s Q1. Square&#8217;s bitcoin revenue has been steadily increasing since Q1 2018, during a bear market no less. It&#8217;s a reflection of retail investor demand, given the peer-to-peer nature of the Cash App. Square also placed a $10,000 weekly cap for </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN.com: Bitcoin played a role in staging the Easter Sunday suicide bombing in Sri Lanka that killed 253 civilians, according to Israeli blockchain intelligence firm Whitestream. The agency revealed that the ISIS used Canada-based payment gateway CoinPayments to convert bitcoins to fiat money. The firm identified large scale transactions between the wallets that ISIS used to raise contributions and the bitcoin accounts held by CoinPayments. Whitestream found that the balances in the payment company&#8217;s wallets surged from $500,000 to $4.5 million just one day before the Easter attacks. The firm added that the CoinPayments&#8217; balances dropped back to $500,000 </p>

This is being made possible through a collaboration between blockchain payments processor BitPay and Refundo, a provider of tax-related financial products.

That said, Refundo&#8217;s CoinRT service is not free. CoinRT costs $34.95 per refund transfer, and that doesn&#8217;t include BitPay&#8217;s 1% service fee.
