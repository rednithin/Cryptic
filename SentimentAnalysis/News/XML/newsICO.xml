				<description><![CDATA[<p>Startup financing took a dramatic turn in 2017 as initial coin offerings (ICOs) burst onto the scene. In 2017 and 2018, more than $14 billion flowed into blockchain projects as investors looked to capitalize on crypto euphoria and the low barriers to entry made possible by the ICO funding model. It has been less than a year since the market for ICOs went bust, but the impact of the new crowdfunding model will endure for many years to come as startups look to tokenize real assets and leverage the power of the crowd to finance their next major project.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Regulators can be blamed for just about everything. The team behind the Thor token is pointing the finger at them for the shuttering of their own operations. However, given Thor raised an impressive $21 million for its crypto project just last year, the excuse is falling on many deaf ears. There was speculation that something was amiss at the company before it made its announcement this week. For example, Thor reportedly locked its Telegram account so that users could not make comments. Some Thor token holders took matters into their own hands: because the main Thor Channel is muted we </p>

They then went on to found Chainstarter, which helps ICO-backed projects get off the ground.

On Yavin, a researcher at Cointelligence, tells the story from beginning to end.

The securities regulator told the Bangkok Post they interviewed &#8220;roughly&#8221; 7-8 portals for the job of selecting ICOs, conducting due diligence, reviewing smart contract codes, and verifying the know-your-customer process. Eventually, the SEC&#8217;s board of directors approved one ICO portal out of all. The commission refused to share any further details about the selected company, except that it was a non-Thailand venture. Archari Suppiroj, the SEC&#8217;s director of Fintech, confirmed that the commission had forwarded its selection to the relevant government agencies, including </p>

Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing service created by Microsoft, recently listed Stratis in its products&#8217; section. The platform, created by London-based Stratis Group, offers a web-based application that enables initial coin offering projects to manage token distribution. It facilitates a secure and flexible payment route that participants use to purchase ICO tokens ahead of the initial allocation. They pay with either Bitcoin or Strat, Stratis&#8217; native token.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most groundbreaking concepts to emerge from blockchain over its short lifespan has been the initial coin offering, or ICO. In this article, the author will discuss an emerging trend called &#8220;Initial Exchange Offerings&#8221; or IEOs. Reading about blockchain or cryptocurrency in any newspaper will allude to this unique type of public offering, which draws parallels with its cousin the IPO. An ICO is when a company issues blockchain tokens that it will then sell in exchange for common cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are more fungible. The fuzzy regulatory status of ICOs and their resulting tokens </p>

Nikkei exclusively reported that local financial authorities are actively exploring the legalization of ICOs for institutional investors and accredited investors, as long as they are lawfully conducted within the boundaries of existing financial regulations. Will South Korea Follow Japan?

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively cracking down on cryptoÂ initial coin offering (ICO) projects and a top official said earlier this year that dozens of cases are pending. The next wave of enforcement by the SEC, stimulated by its recent settlement with professional boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled, is expected to be on social media influencers who have promoted ICOs to the general public. When is ICO Promotion a Fraud? Writers, YouTube celebrities, cryptocurrency review platforms, publications, and many more individuals and organizations could be targeted by the SEC if thereâs sufficient evidence to </p>

The company was reportedly dissolved due to an alleged unauthorized Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on November 28,Â local German news outlet Handelsblatt reports. Envion was established to serve as an off-grid mining company which makes use of clean, decentralized energy (like solar power or hydroelectricity) to power mobile mining units.

According to local news outlet Dinheiro Vivo, the clubâs vice-president Francisco Salgado Zenha claimed the organization is currently pondering the option, although thereâs still ânothing concreteâ on the subject. He was quoted as saying: âWe are looking closely at an ICO. Weâre having meetings about it. There is a great value potential in the Sporting brand.â The manager then emphasized </p>

Earlier this week, the US SEC cracked down on Paragon and AirFox, two initial coin offering (ICO) projects that raised $12 million and $15 million respectively in two different areas of the crypto market.

As CCN reported on November 16, Paragon and AirFox were ordered to pay a $350,000 fine to the U.S. SEC and refund investors who participated in the token sale. The problem for the two tokens is that they have been asked by the US SEC to refund $12 million and $15 million respectively to investors, and since their ICOs, the prices of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and </p>
