				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Delving into the blog of self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright continues to produce combustible findings. This week Wright continued his assault on the sea-faring John McAfee, who Wright called a criminal, and dared him to take it to court. That might be tough for McAfee, who supposedly lives in international waters while on the run from U.S tax authorities &#8211; and running for president himself. Amid this apparent stalemate, Craig Wright continued to push the prospects of his Bitcoin SV project and questioned the wisdom of crypto anonymity.

De Mol, who according to Forbes is worth $1.7 billion, has reportedly filed a complaint in an Amsterdam court against the social media giant for not doing more to prevent the alleged crypto frauds. The ads, which reportedly lured investors to buy bitcoin or engage in crypto-related endeavors that they claimed de Mol had a hand in, are now gone. If you don&#8217;t think you know Dutch </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; By CCN: Thinking of buying bitcoin at current prices? Think again. The cryptocurrency has surged so far, so rapidly, that its rally is already starting to crater. While the coming implosion will exert pain across the entire market, it should present new opportunities that savvy investors can leverage to enhance the long-term value of their holdings. One profitable opportunity that we’re monitoring is the flow of capital out of bitcoin and into altcoins. With the capital outflow, the Bitcoin Dominance Index should plunge to a level that favors other cryptocurrencies. In short, the bitcoin price teetering on the brink of </p>

Wright says that once courts figure out the money transmitter nature of various blockchain products, swift action can be expected. Satoshi Nakamoto Calls for Government Regulation? Wright believes that a few government orders could swiftly lead to the destruction of several blockchain systems.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; By CCN: Bitcoin price is unlikely to hit the December 2017 highs unless the U.S.-China trade war escalates to new levels, an analyst has told Kitco News. According to DailyFX’s senior currency strategist Christopher Vecchio, bitcoin has lately been inversely correlated with the Chinese yuan. Being an effective method of moving value around the world, its price appreciated as the yuan weakened: In an environment where the global financial system looks like it is potentially at risk because of the world’s two largest economies going at odds, people may be looking for alternative avenues to find ways to circumvent </p>

One indicator, however, suggests that the selling pressure isn&#8217;t over yet. The VERA Convergence-Divergence signal is a Bitcoin volatility indicator that&#8217;s flashing warning signs. As Bloomberg reports, the &#8216;VERA Cvg Dvg&#8217; is once again flashing a sell in 2019. The first and only other sell signal this year was a red herring in late April. If traders had taken the bait then, they would have lost out on a potential 70 percent gain. A Reliable Bitcoin Volatility Indicator? Traders are </p>

At its yearly peak recorded on May 29, the bitcoin price surged to as high as $9,096, nearly achieving a 140 percent year-to-date gain against the U.S. dollar. Following the steep fall in the bitcoin price, several traders foresee the dominant crypto asset continuing its pullback in the near-term while remaining generally optimistic about the macro landscape of the crypto market.

It is partially due to a full-fledged trading market that went underground abruptly owing to a blanket ban announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Panicked traders shuffled to a few known cryptocurrency exchanges such as ZebPay and UnoCoin to either withdraw or sell their bitcoins. Many of them to this date trade cryptocurrencies away from the watchful eye of law and lawmakers — and they believe a potential crypto ban at the behest of </p>

While the bitcoin price is plunging this week, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision — the cryptocurrency championed by Wright — has notched record highs. In fact, BSV is one among a tiny handful of digital currencies whose price is climbing while bitcoin — the original cryptocurrency — is flailing. BSV Climbs While BTC Sinks It&#8217;s unclear what&#8217;s driving this rally, but BSV has gradually been rising for the past year. Its value now tops $225. For reference, BSV traded at just $70 in December 2018. That&#8217;s </p>

That&#8217;s the wildly-optimistic outlook of a former executive at crypto unicorn Coinbase.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160; By CCN: In the past several hours, the bitcoin price has dropped from around $8,500 to $7,732, by nearly 14% against the U.S. dollar. A pullback for bitcoin was generally anticipated by technical analysts following its 130 percent year-to-date gain. Traders were taken aback by the magnitude of the drop of the dominant crypto asset in a short time frame and if the asset does not demonstrate a speedy recovery, several technical analysts forsee bitcoin testing support levels in the $7,100 to $7,300 range. Why bitcoin price fell and what it would need to rebound Some investors have speculated </p>

A blockbuster investigation into his personal finances reveals that, despite his life of staggering luxury, he paid less than $50 in income tax in 2017. Billionaire Bitcoin Mining Tycoon Gets Richer &#8211; And Pays Barely Any Taxes A BBC report exposed Frank Timis&#8217;s personal tax return from 2017, revealing that he had paid just £35.20 (around $44) in income tax, despite renting a £14,000-a-month penthouse and spending &#8220;thousands&#8221; dining in London&#8217;s finest restaurants.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: The most common argument Bitcoin increasing in value is its potential disruption of the haven gold market. One of the loudest evangelists of this belief, Cameron Winklevoss, was again urging people on Twitter not to miss out on this game-changing capital transfer because of a lack of imagination. We talk about going to Mars all the time. We have no limits to our imagination when it comes to space travel. But when it comes to the future of money, curiously many suffer from an acute failure of imagination. The Bitcoin rocket ship is fueling up, make sure to </p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>By CCN: Now that the bitcoin price has momentum on its side, the bulls are placing bullish bets again. The most aggressive trades are seemingly happening in the crypto derivatives market where the risk/reward profile differs vs. the spot market. Now that the bitcoin price has generated returns of approximately 130% year-to-date, derivatives traders are willing to put it on the line once again. One bullish trade that has resurfaced in the crypto call options market is a bet that the bitcoin price will surpass $50,000 by this time next year, which would reflect an increase of roughly 150% versus </p>

But fortunes have turned for Softbank and Mr. Son. Softbank stock has slumped nearly 20 percent since its April highs, its Uber investment is looking shaky, and new fundraising efforts are failing. Meanwhile, Mr. Son revealed his monstrous losses from a disastrous bitcoin bet.

That&#8217;s the opinion of attorney John Reed Stark, a cybersecurity expert who worked for 20 years at the SEC&#8217;s enforcement division. In a damning Law 360 column, Stark says the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon crack down on initial exchange offerings (IEO), which he called an &#8220;unregulated crypto-casino fundraising mutation.&#8221; Moreover, Stark underscored that bitcoin is a con, and he advised investors to steer clear of it before they lose their money </p>

On major regulated crypto asset exchanges like Bitstamp, the bitcoin price dropped to as low as $8,000 on last Friday, sparking fears of a potential decline below $7,000 in an anticipated pullback. The dominant crypto asset showed immediate recovery beyond $8,200, a support level many technical analysts have emphasized as crucial for the near-term sustainability of bitcoin. Traders more </p>
