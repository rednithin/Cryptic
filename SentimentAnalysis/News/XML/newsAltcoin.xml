				<description><![CDATA[<p>Since achieving a new all-time high above $4,500, bitcoin price has recorded four minor corrections. Earlier today, on August 22, bitcoin price fell to $3,800 as the market and investors started to fear for a sell-off prior to the scheduled November SegWit2x hard fork supported by a few major companies including BitPay. In July, when bitcoin price experienced a minor correction and dropped by around $300, analysts attributed the decline in the value of bitcoin to the imminence of the August 1 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork. At the time, ViaBTC and Bitmain hinted the possibility of the BCH hard </p>

Some analysts including Koji Higashi, the co-founder of IndieSquare based in Japan, have attributed the increase in the market cap of NEM and price of XEM to the exponentially growing alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market in Japan. A major factor that has allowed NEM to transform into one of the most popular altcoins in Japan is its development team and company composed of Japanese founders and talents. NEM was initially developed and introduced in Japan by Makoto Takemiya, the co-founder and CEO of Soramitsu, the company that </p>

Over the past seven days, bitcoin has surged from $1,278 to $1,471, recording a 13.4 percent weekly increase in price.
