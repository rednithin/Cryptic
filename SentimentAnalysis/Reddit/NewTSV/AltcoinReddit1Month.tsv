 amp x200b technically a blockchain is a chain of blocks ordered in a network of non trusted peers each block references the previous one and contains data its own hash and the hash of the previous block a unit of data stored inside a block may be represented by any value depending on the type of blockchain a block can store an amount of money a share in a company a digital certificate of ownership a vote during an election or any other value a block stores encrypted details about the parties whose interaction resulted in the data stored in the block a cryptocurrency also contains the sender s and receiver s encrypted identifiers a block for an ecommerce transaction will contain the identifiers of the retailer and consumer for example each block also has a hash this hash is a value generated from a string of text using a mathematical function a hash can be compared to a fingerprint as each hash is unique its role is to identify a block and the block s contents once a block is created a hash is calculated changing something inside the block causes the hash to change so a hash also indicates changes to a block also each block contains a hash of the previous block for instance if there are three blocks in a blockchain block 3 will contain the hash of block 2 and block 2 will contain the hash of block 1 if anyone changes the data in a single block the hash of that particular block changes but it also makes the whole chain invalid a hash is a great tool for identifying attempts to change data in blocks however a hash algorithm alone is not enough to ensure the security of a blockchain to mitigate attempts to corrupt the blockchain and to ensure security blockchain technology also uses a process called proof of work sha 384 algorithm and its use sha 384 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input of a random size and produces an output of a fixed size hash functions are powerful because they are one way what this is means is it is possible for anyone to use a hash function to produce an output when given an input however it is impossible to use the output of the hash function to reconstruct it s given input this powerful feature of the sha 384 hash function makes it ideal for application within the terragreencoin platform the sha 384 hash function is utilized within the terragreen network in following ways creation of terragreen coin addresses sha 384 is defined in the exact same manner as sha 512 with the following two exceptions 1 the initial hash value h 0 is based on the fractional parts of the square roots of the ninth through sixteenth primes h 0 1 cbbb9d5dc1059ed8 h 0 2 629a292a367cd507 h 0 3 9159015a3070dd17 h 0 4 152fecd8f70e5939 h 0 5 67332667ffc00b31 h 0 6 8eb44a8768581511 h 0 7 db0c2e0d64f98fa7 h 0 8 47b5481dbefa4fa4 2 the final 384 bit hash is obtained by truncating the sha 512 based hash output to its left most 384 bits hence the hash of abc is cb00753f45a35e8b b5a03d699ac65007 272c32ab0eded163 1a8b605a43ff5bed 8086072ba1e7cc23 58baeca134c825a7 and the hash of abcdefghbcdefghicdefghijdefghijkefghijklfghijklmghijklmnhijklmnoijklmnopjklmnopqklmnopqrlmnopqrsmnopqrstnopqrstu with no line break after the first n is 09330c33f71147e8 3d192fc782cd1b47 53111b173b3b05d2 2fa08086e3b0f712 fcc7c71a557e2db9 66c3e9fa91746039 this innovative algorithm enables terragreen to be used for creating value and authenticates digital information additionally inside the terragreen ecosystem there are three sub ecosystems actively working by exchanging data analyzing them generating reports and making predictive and or prescriptive actionable suggestions to each other in real time 	1

many people will tell you that bitcoin is king it would be hard to argue against their point but i d like to specify that bitcoin does in fact appear to be a king king of speculation it has become an online casino for the uninformed and indifferent and while it has drawn mainstream attention to some of the many benefits of modern cryptography and distributed ledger technology it has also become a burdensome anchor weighing down new projects and forcing developers to consider appeasing a fickle speculative market when they could be making real progress on the tech side off things immoderate use of phrases like to the moon or wen lambo superfluously congest all communication channels and misinformation proliferates perpetually by a crowd that simply can t be reasoned with i won t even get into the subjects of apparent coordinated downvoting and the suspected existence of dedicated agenda pushing groups because that in itself would be speculation although a strong case can be made based on the regularly submitted evidence while there has been remarkable progress made in the general crypto space infrastructure the point is there s still a lot left to be desired some might say that this is it this is as far as it can go but until grandma is using crypto whether she knows it or not then i wouldn t be so quick to rule out new advancements so while bitcoin may be king of speculation and it clearly leaves room for improvement then perhaps an as of now undiscovered or yet to be created crypto will quietly rise up the ranks to the position of king of adoption based simply on meeting the common general desires for convenience scalability functionality privacy and security of investment both network protection and relative stability in price these are primary areas of interest that will require continual improvement rght now bitcoin sits relatively stagnant considering the many technological innovations that have been made in the decade since it s inception amp x200b i do have a project in mind myself but we all know how that d go if i included it so i won t also the point of this post is to exchange information with each other not push a project with that in mind are there any projects that you feel exceptionally passionate about and that you believe has the potential to break on through to grandma and ultimately global mainstream adoption amp x200b please don t just list names i know some still will but please try to read the question before you answer give examples of what it is that makes your project so pervasive issuance model incentives true decentralization if use case is your example please specify why please try to be helpful respectful if you need to say things like u all idiots u gonna lose everything then just say it to yourself in your room all alone i will never understand the mentality behind a real thinking person saying something like that how did you even end up here clicking through links apparently reading up on this if you re a professional troll or simply a general misery seeking company type just find somewhere else to try to spread that amp x200b also since we are discussing adoption and areas that can be improved upon what are your ideas that can improve things in crypto overall 	1

aquest introduction a decentralized application dapp is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system dapps have been mostly popularized by distributed ledger technologies mainly these tokens can be further explained by looking at blockchain technology for example ethereum blockchain where dapps are often referred to as smart contracts decentralized applications are stored on and executed by a blockchain system when we talk of something being decentralized it simply means that it is not owned controlled or managed by a single person or authority benefits of dapp dapps mainly employ cryptocurrencies as the built in medium of exchange as a result dapps could potentially dramatically boost the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by exposing more people to it it can theoretically facilitate completely censorship resistant applications as a result it can be thought of as an application which hands back control to its users any changes to the dapps can only be performed through consensus users of decentralized applications enjoy a far more distributed approach any computation needed is done at different nodes none of these nodes are instructing the other nodes as a result decentralized applications will not theoretically need any sort of downtime hence eliminating the need for a single entity however aquest is a unique decentralized app that pays you for completing a certain task simple as that it is being developed by enkronos its credit system is already tokenized on a private ledger and it is a shared resource among all the products published in its platform the final goal is to adopt aqu token as its internal fuel creating a public ledger blockchain based aquest platform in order to reward the users the platform has developed varieties of simple tasks like facebook for this case you will be rewarded after completing simple tasks like sharing liking and commenting on certain facebook posts as you will be directed survey for this case you will be required to answer some questions about certain projects or programs in some cases you will be given various answers from which you can pick the one that best fits you about a particular question being asked if the quest is an airdrop quest the signee can obtain valid erc 20 tokens at the end of the airdrop aqu aquest ico click the links below for more information and offers features of this project this project has gotten varieties of features simply to satisfy its investors and users plus the cryptocurrency world as a whole which include the following secure aquest is built on top of the enkronos apps stack and uses smart contracts to regulate signes for erc20 quests rewards you can pay your signees in erc 20 tokens in future we plan to implement also paypal credit cards and other digital currencies variability aquest can be a survey a bounty task a facebook like watching an add installing an app or catching a pokemon on pokemon go enkronos apps integration aquests are a great way to help build up the users pool in enkronos apps mobile first our mobile first approach enables you to earn easily on your mobile device accessible everyone can join aquest no restrictions no kyc token information token aqu typeutility preico price 1 aqu 0 003 eth price 1 aqu 0 006 eth bonus available mvp prototype available platform ethereum accepting eth btc enk fiat minimum investment 0 1 eth soft cap 1 000 000 usd hard cap 39 000 000 usd country slovenia whitelist kyc none restricted areas none for more information click the links below website white paper telegram facebook twitter my bitcointalk username gadithomason bitcointalk link profile my bounty0x username gadithomason 	1
making pos secure and compelling elrond has proposed a novel approach to consensus called secure proof of stake combining eligibility through stake and rating random validator selection and an optimal dimension for the consensus group the consensus protocol starts by randomly sampling a smaller consensus group out of all eligible validators in the shard for reduced communication using a randomness source derived from the previous block s signature the randomness source is unpredictable before the signing of the previous block the sampling is deterministic meaning that every node can compute the list of validators in the consensus group and the first node to be selected is the block proposer the block proposer aggregates transactions into a new block and sends this block to the validators in the consensus group for verification each validator will verify the validity of the block process the transactions and if everything checks out will participate in the pbft consensus the voting in the pbft is done for every validator by sending a signature for a multisignature scheme if the proposer collects more than 2 3 1 signatures from the consensus group members the block is considered validated the aggregated signature can be added to the block and the block disseminated in the entire shard the next consensus group will be randomly sampled using the new signature amp x200b elrondnetwork amp x200b 	2

 tldr got sick of managing a diversified portfolio made a binance trading bot that handles it for you during the 2017 christmas break i realized i was spending close to 5 hours a month manually rebalancing my portfolio of 20 cryptocurrencies weighted by market cap i got sick of that pretty quickly so i decided to make a bot that uses binance s api to automatically handle that for the memes it s called hodlbot it s been over a year since i quit my job and decided to work on it full time here are a few things that it can do build your own cryptocurrency index create your own index screenshot select two market cap ranks and hodlbot will fetch all the coins in between e g coins 1 30 50 100 you can set minimum and maximum percentage caps a minimum percentage cap will ensure that no allocation in the you can also choose between market cap weighting square root market cap weighting or even weighting blacklist coins you want to avoid and hodlbot will replace it with the next highest coin by market cap create a custom portfolio choose what coins you want in your portfolio and how much they are weighted choose between fixed weighting market cap weighting or square root market cap weighting use modifiers to increase or decrease weightings e g 2x market cap run historical backtest backtest screenshot we pull cryptocurrency price data from exchanges in order so you can backtest a strategy before executing it fees and rebalances are taken into consideration for the backtest automatic rebalancing when the market shifts a portfolio will drift away from its target allocation portfolio rebalances are automatically executed you can choose to set your rebalancing period to whatever you want we ve written studies on rebalancing how much does it cost to keep things affordable we ve made it free for all users under 500 for users above 500 it s 10 month after a 14 day free trial are there minimum account size restrictions no account minimums but due to minimum trading limits on binance we recommend at least 200 please feel free to ask questions and give feedback i ll be lurking around the comment section 	0

in the past 3 months we have been searching far and wide for an upcoming ico that isn t a scam this journey took us all the way to transylvania where we found a project that is not only extremely talented and far ahead of their competition but also are raising less than 5 million usd after further investigation we think to have found another gem with a potential upside bigger than that of our last partner lto network we would like to introduce to you elrond network s journey as written by their head of communication dan elrond s journey in 1000 words why did we start elrond the answer to this question has a lot to do with intuition in september 2017 as the ico craze gained momentum there were two problems that seemed imminent and pressing limited scalability and pow s unsustainable carbon footprint that s not to say that there weren t any attempts to solving these it s just that at that point they were either merely theoretical or difficult to implement can t change an engine whilst driving our team already had a deep understanding of the underlying technologies and significant market insight owing to skin in the game so getting the elrond project going came naturally some of you can relate to the exciting times of getting the initial team together and having those meetings in which you d discuss intriguing problems and state of the art technologies that was a time of intense exploration fueled by our purpose to build a value transfer protocol for the digital economy one that can scale is fast and comparatively efficient our first office was basically two small rooms we couldn t fit the computers and all the people in the same room so we had to split whenever someone had a presentation and used the whiteboard we all cramped into one room but this modest beginning motivated us to do better and come up with novel ideas that today have become written code ideas are nice but show me real progress in may 2018 after considerable technical work we made our whitepaper v1 6 public at the time many people were looking for their next big hit so our inbox was flooded with requests on a daily basis we could have just taken the money but we chose to stand by our approach setting a firm foundation and showing progress first and afterwards onboard people who understood our vision and would help us achieve it was the prototype going to prove us right or wrong two work intensive months followed and the result was the first version of the prototype what we ought to say at this point is that a prototype is by definition unfinished and unpolished but still extremely useful in our case the prototype validated the hypothesis that we can do state sharding and especially confirmed our model of doing cross shard transactions as you can imagine this was a truly special moment for us because the team s hard work had tangible results in a startup specific roller coaster this was our first significant success this taught us that sometimes you need to stop look around and re calibrate your vision so we decided to ignore the schadenfreude and continue executing on our long term plan our strategy shifted towards a more community based approach and that lead us to travel the world while actively seeking valuable feedback from our community we ve meet a great number of exceptional people in different countries around the globe and built great support around our vision 	1

 elrond does horizontal scaling with state sharding zilliqa tries to solve scalability by addressing half of the problem and that is by doing network and transaction sharding so they bring some of the solution and they can process about 2500 tps 2828 tps with 3600 nodes they do not solve the hardest of the problem which is state sharding state sharding basically means for zilliqa that every node in the network has to store the entire state of the blockchain in very high throughput blockchains the storage requirements grow very fast elrond solves the storage problems by also sharding state so that every node in the network has to store just a part of the entire state the one corresponding for it s shard zilliqa still uses pow in order to prevent sybil attacks while elrond uses pos a much more energy efficient way to prevent sybil attacks zilliqa stores all the smart contracts in a single shard while elrond will distribute smart contracts among all shards in order to be able to parallelize smart contract execution 	1

 this bot automates making markets on binance where other market making bots fail ie bitmex deribit other attempts i ve made in the past is by counting on the market to not be volatile where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself where on bitmex and deribit these spreads ar 0 25 of a btc some smaller markets on binance have 1 2 5 spreads and greater than average volumes you ll want to have about 20 per market pair it s looking to trade in the base asset btc bnb eth etc it will look to trade more markets if the targetspread targetvoldiv targetvolmult are higher the more total funds in a particular base asset there are the higher value the orders will have if for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of considered pairs it will continue selling that asset with the same sell logic on the quoteasset bnb market while pausing buying it i don t have enough personal funds available to run the bot but i can get a good amount of income if i share it and people use my ref link targetordersizemult exists so that people can compete using the same bot on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot constantly as you can set a of your order size to ignore when there s a bid or ask better than yours when the volume that beats your price is higher than the order size this multiplier it ll re enter the market note that you should never trust your api keys to a bot without proper code review nefarious people out there will use your balance to manipulate the price of very low liquid markets and pick up a huge amount of cheap tokens from your hard earned crypto at the current time binance rate limits are 1200 requests per minute 10 orders per second 100 000 orders per 24hrs there are no limits for unfilled orders and at most it ll make about 6x 20 or so pairs x 2 orders 1 cancel and 1 re post a minute along with checking balance and getting order books so a total of about 500 a minute not close to 1200 on that note i ve only been trading one pair averaging 42 orders an hour or 1000 per day again by about 20 pairs would be 20 000 orders per day a bit shy of 100k 	1

the advancement on today s technology is never ending and might be overwhelming to some we can see how older generations struggle to grasp the new technologies today one of the technology that had been fast growing and revolutionizing is blockchain so what is blockchain blockchain is a decentralized ledger or records of transactions that is verified via a mathematical technique that is borrowed from cryptography this distributed ledger is considered as transparent and secure looking into it further blockchain is a global and open infrastructure in where other technologies and applications can be built with blockchain it is believe that the use of intermediaries could be reduce or eliminated at all as of now blockchain is considered as a tool to revolutionize and improve the structure and operations of traditional industries like the healthcare entertainment banking music gaming banks insurance law firms and the government blockchain can indeed bring great advancement to the world however one can ask if why it is not mass adopted yet the possible answer to this is that there is no uniformity in the processes that involves blockchain may it be the developers or the users side thus resulting to a delayed mass adoption some of the factors that can point this out is that unlike the internet different blockchains does not have a standard protocol to follow when developing an app dapp as each blockchain requires a different approach furthermore most projects in blockchain aims to overlap each other not help improve each other today you can see projects that have the same goals and initiatives they aim to be the best in the field seeing this we can say that they are aiming to achieve the better good for them and not for the masses so how can this be addressed how can blockchain be mass adopted the possible answer to this is through uniformity a total mass collaboration imagine if different blockchains could transform into one single identity a single blockchain that is compromise by all of the best features of different blockchains what if all crypto based projects in an industry would collaborate to offer the better good to everyone this would surely make these projects and different blockchains reach its full potential as everyone does not aim to just overlap each other but to improve further a standard on creating apps and dapps in each blockchain as creating apps and platforms in each blockchain requires different approaches the adoption of this technology by developers is not yet mainstream so what if there is a standard way on how one can develop in each blockchain would not that be more easy for developers and normal users to learn how this can be done a uniformed and simplified way for users imagine a platform that works like a google playstore or an appstore instead of normal apps dapps and platforms that are developed in each blockchain are featured making it simple for users to access and adapt to this technology in an easy way could make it more enticing to even the older generations blockchain is a great technology that have recently emerge in the world however people behind this technology should find a way on how this can be easily adopted by everyone in the world 	1

disclaimer this post is aimed at people who see value in pow consensus it isn t aimed at starting a discussion on the disadvantages of pow or the advantages of other crypto consensus the post neither intends to start a debate on the futility of asic resistance and the advantages of higher hashrate at the cost of centralisation to those who manufacture asic if you are one of the people who have a strong opinion on the above then i request you to skip this post tldr here is the source code cn gpu uses 32bit floating point operations to beat asic s hashrate is directly propotional to no of fp cores and more fp cores increases heat generation and power consumption there is a physical limit to how fast the asic s can be due to size of die thermal limit etc 10x faster asic are unlikely let alone 100x vive la r sistance cn history before we divulge into cn gpu let me first introduce you to the current situation of cryptonote space and the fight against asic asic s first showed up at the end of 2017 bullrun coins which were based on cryptonote use cryptonight pow it was assumed until then that developing asic s for cn was cost prohibitive however with abnormal hashrate increases in different cn based coins particularly in moreno people begin to question the asic resistance of cn pow given the situation at that time it was assumed that the abnormal hashrate increase was due to the interest in mining by the masses few even claimed that the hashrate explosion was due to gpu farms powered by solar power however when the enthusiasm died down in later months the presence of asic became more apparent due to the secretive nature of asic manufacturing and development it was only later that their presence was confirmed to a gpu miner the results should be terrifying asic could perform 64x cnv8 better than gpu s the common theme among every attempt at asic resistance was making a minor change in cn pow while such an approach bricked the current versions of asic s given few months they would come back it seems that asic s have been bitten by the crypto bug even in a bear market the cost of fabricating a new batch of asic and putting them to work seems to be a profitable business venture let us look at the most well known example of asic resistance monero the developers first changed their pow in april to brick the aisc s by the time of monero s next hardfork later that year the network was again riddled by asic fpga monero again changed their algo to to cnv8 the current version and looking at the present situation it would seem that asic have come back with a vengeance monero s next hardfork is on march 9 while the current batch of asic will be bricked some hardware specialists have expressed doubts against the next pow whether such doubts are justified only time will tell cn gpu coming to the topic at hand cn gpu is developed by u fireice uk and u psychocrypt the developers have previously made cn heavy which was later adopted by nearly 10 coins in spite of low market cap 444k and ranking 1300 of cn heavy based ryo after a period of nearly 8 months asic fpga showed up on its network in late december the devs could have claimed that the large miner was a gpu farm powered by solar instead the devs informed the ryo community about the possibility of fpga asic and started developing a new pow cn gpu is a complete rewrite of original cn pow and is based on 32 bit floating point operations namely addition subtractions multiplication amp division it doesn t rely on any fancy feature instead anchoring its performance to physical no of cores the algorithm is very through test for ieee 754 implementation and has been tested on intel sse2 intel avx arm7 arm8 nvidia amd some might argue that floating point maths can be done using and or xor gates which can be pipelined by a asic manufacturer while this is technically true it should be noted that any computer operation can be reduced to a series of nand gates just as you can solve bitcoin hash using pen and paper you could also mine cn gpu by using nand gates both the methods are inefficient the best way to do floating point operations is through fp cores ah ha asic can be made with only fp cores before you rush to your nearest asic manufacturer with this idea you should know that there is already an asic for floating point operations gpu yes gpu can also be called as floating point asic because they are filled with fp cores you don t believe me and have already reached the asic manufacturer since gpu s are filled with fp cores you propose a die which is twice the size of a normal gpu and you remove everything present on a gpu die apart from fp cores first problem you would face is the wattage consumption and heat dissipation since most power is consumed by fp cores in gpu stripping everything apart from it and adding more fp cores would increase power consumption and heat generation again the more no of fp core you add the more the watt and heat you have to deal with you won t be able to add 60x time of fp cores you still go ahead great you now have a machine which can mine cn gpu since the only way to get more hash rate is through more number of fp cores to get 50x 125x you will require 50x 125x of fp cores of normal gpu which isn t feasible however it is possible to make asic which are 2 3x that of gpu s with 2 3x the fp cores you now have a machine that is 2 3x faster than gpu s but at what price will you sell them will a person buy a 6000 asic which is only2 3x faster than a gpu as of now there are no cn based coin in top 10 what about fpga well by now it shouldn t come as a surprise that fpga can mine cn gpu in fact all fpga advertise tflops a measure of floating point operations bitman recently jumped into the market with their fpga which can do 2tflops and if you have 10k lying around and buy the top of the line fpga which is made by intel you would get 9 2tflops sounds good right well if you have a vega 64 you would get 12 5tflops this is why deep machine learning farms use gpu instead of fpga s the deepfakes some of you view for science are made possible by floating point asic aka gpu and the reluctance of companies such as google or apple to make their own fp asic for their deep learning should speak volumes you would be curious about the performance of cpu on the pow the performance of cpu is limiting the devs have acknowledged it and expressed their desire for closing the asymmetry in next iteration of pow present l3 2mb scratchpads will be 3gb scratchpads taking a detour to express my personal opinion cpu mining in spite of many years has failed to develop dedicated cpu mining communities like the ones we have for gpu mining the lack of profitability is the major reason why we won t see any large scale cpu mining communities this isn t saying that cpu only mining is not viable if some coin manages to keep away botnets and server farms and ensures profitability of solo miners with ever decreasing supply i would be delighted to see them succeed another valid criticism of cn gpu is the lack of documentation given the little time the devs had 2 months it would be fair to give them some time before demanding documentation the devs are quite busy playing bingo once they have free time documentation would be made available on a silver plate this brings us to the end of our post cn gpu doesn t have any magic tricks up its sleeve while it is possible to have asic s on the network which are 2 3x faster than gpu s the cost should prevent any large scale operations this is not a perfect solution it is however better than allowing asic to mine one s network while waiting for the perfect solution the pow provides a new path for projects who want asic resistance and are tired of playing the game of cat and mouse with asic 	1

i am an engineer from india who passionately cared about finance large demographic right amp x200b regardless i want to share my crypto journey with you it s both a cautionary tale and the inspiration for a start up i founded last year i completed my education at a top tier engineering college in bits pilani rajasthan while there i took a keen interest in finance and worked hard to transition into getting into piramal capital a pe fund based out of mumbai while i was there i couldn t help but notice the disparities in classes in a city like mumbai this disparity along with my stint in finance painted an ugly picture of the traditional economy where there are a few winners and a whole bunch of losers the notion of middlemen and middleman fees in banking irked me because when we zoom out and look at the bigger picture bank charges amount to millions of dollars every year as someone who grew up with parents running a family business this pain was sharper for us for banks their users only make money when the market goes up but banks make money regardless sometimes they make money at the cost of the customer so there s no alignment of incentives between traditional banking finance and the end user so the industry just didn t feel right for me i left piramal capital and moved to bangalore where i started working as the head of partnerships at tapchief tapchief too wanted to make the economy a better place through skill sharing and i thought that it may be a good place to understand money making but deeply community oriented start ups amp x200b i had first come across the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology during the silk route bust that happened in 2013 and wrote it off as dark web currency or drug dealer money i kept my sights on the currency and technology though and continued my research into the space i kept reading about the tech but didn t actually invest until the first quarter of 2017 while working at tapchief i ended up reading the bitcoin white paper before investing in cryptocurrency and was sold on the idea of blockchain technology cryptocurrencies and the vision of satoshi i made a lot of money in crypto and i lost even more but i never lost faith in the technology itself i continued my inquiry into bitcoin read about ethereum and started exploring the other tokens in the market i also started going for these blockchain meetups to increase my understanding of what was happening in the space i knew that this technology and currency was going to be extremely powerful but it took me some time to figure out the fact that this is what i wanted to get involved in so i ended up quitting tapchief in october 2017 took a few months off to realize my intentions of being involved in the world of crypto it was the fact that i had invested in the space myself that i knew what i wanted to create in the short term i wanted the product to help people who showed early faith in the tech through cryptocurrency to have a safe place to store grow and use their cryptocurrency in the long term i wanted this to be a better bank which made financial services more customer centric and made people s lives better through easy access to capital i came back from my brief vacation and started doing research on what the market opportunities are what the community cares about what they re vocal about what they despise and what they stand for and that s where the bank of hodlers was thought about amp x200b my background in finance and foray into the world of blockchain and crypto was a perfect marriage of two worlds where one had the significant potential to disrupt the other i knew that blockchain technology has the capacity to disrupt finance in a way that removed centralized entities i realized that this domain had the capacity to provide banking and financial services to those that did not want to visit a bank or a centralized financial institution to avail financial services such people were already in the market i e the crypto holders i just wanted to solve for the market the bank of hodlers was started to serve this exact community i e people who hold or are open to holding cryptocurrencies but aren t traders we believe that cryptocurrencies will eventually replace or surpass fiat currencies in trade and volume and we want to be ready for that we want to be the bank of the future and solve for a market where people use crypto as a medium of exchange for payments and as a store of value amp x200b we re here with a product in our asset backed lending service with such a service crypto holders will be able to earn interest on their deposits for lenders the interest on deposits is dynamic and will be updated to them every week they will be able to earn interest on 4 major tokens lenders will soon have
