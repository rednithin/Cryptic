alice wants to buy bitcoin for ether and bob wants to buy ether for bitcoin alice sets a price on the website and bob likes the price and clicks get into trade alice initiates a contract with the amount of ether set in the price to bitcoin bob s bitcoin address and bob s ethereum address this could be initiated with an email saying bob would like to trade with you click here with bobs info auto filled into a web3 transaction bob sends the bitcoin to alice alice sees the bitcoins arrive and waits for 6 confirmations or can even do it early if she is confident after six confirmations alice sends a transaction to the smart contract which sends the ether to bob by a self destruct with bobs ethereum address as a parameter self destruct will free up storage and result in a cheaper transaction settlement mechanism if alice never claims to have received the bitcoins but did bob can void the contract after a set timestamp and get the coins by providing proof of his bitcoin transaction with summa tx in the smart contract a valid slice of at least 6 blocks of transaction proof the smart contract is self destructed on his ethereum address if bob never sends the bitcoins he will be unable to void the contract and alice can self destruct it back to her wallet after the set timestamp requirements alice should only provide a fresh bitcoin address with no existing transactions one contract one trade contract can only be instantiated when the trade has begun this prevents alice from making a contract in advance and waiting till it is nearly expired and thus self destructing the contract and getting the bitcoins bob must be certain the amount of coins he sends matches the amount again can be handled with a simple payment qr code a timestamp with ample time for a settlement to occur a bytecode matcher which only let s bob enter the trade if the contract code matches what the contract is supposed to be 	1

a solution just occurred to me about how to establish a registry of unique and private human identities in a public blockchain it s not a solution i ve seen discussed before and i m starting to wonder why that might be it s deceptively simple essentially we could design an imitation game or stochastic challenge response process a turing test complex enough to prove that each player is exhibiting intelligent human behavior which would need to be played at a specific agreed upon time and on a periodic basis it wouldn t be a one off mechanism but an infinitely repeated game these conditions seem to ensure the uniqueness of each player as there would be no machine which could replicate a cognitively meaningful path through the game and no way for each unique participant to play the game more than once simultaneously in short the successful completion of this game would earn the players a security token which they could then exchange for a private key to some registry of unique identity holders i imagine this could all be designed in such a way that there would be no transitive connection between the digital and real world identities of the players another benefit is the fact that this can be implemented in regular software without any expensive biometric hardware providing high on boarding bandwidth relative to other approaches we re really talking about a kind of mmo captcha with intermittent state updates to the blockchain and who knows this may even be an enjoyable and non bureaucratic experience for the players i realize this would be an extremely difficult engineering and social coordination feat but is there any reason in principle this form of solution couldn t be feasible very open to any thoughts criticisms resources or projects along these lines 	2

 there are concerns that the use of non fungible tokens could end up becoming fragmented with different standards and varying degrees of certification at the moment as we mentioned a little earlier it can be an expensive and complicated thing to achieve it can sometimes take months to develop a dapp and in the fast moving blockchain world that could cost an entrepreneur their competitive advantage instead of every outlet interested in non fungible tokens creating their own framework which would result in a breeding ground for inconsistency some platforms are trying to create a technological layer which unifies and standardizes these tokens one of them is 0xcert which offers a plug and play framework which means that a non fungible token can be developed and verified quicker and the platform claims it is achievable in days the company says it eliminates the need for in depth blockchain knowledge while stopping precious data from being siloed and preventing developers from having a lengthy expensive and insecure process 	1

hello i have some questions a distribuited ledger will it never perform as a centralized one or is it a pipe dream because last day the website i used went down for 1 hour and this is a bad thing that won t never happen if the website was hosted on a distribuited database on the other hand distribuited data base and d apps are an unpratical way of doing internet the transactions must be shared and verified by all the memebers in the network amp x200b my question is will we ever reach the point to have dapps and distribuited databases which that performs the same way as the centralized ones amp x200b with sharding only some nodes on the network choosen randomly perform the verification task and no need to download all the historical transactions so my question is amp x200b can ethereum or other dlt reach the scalability level of central databaseses 	1

you are a gift from the gods your passion commitment and hard work are deeply appreciated beyond comprehension i cannot express the gratitude that i feel for living in a timeline with individuals as dedicated as in this one when surly audiences cast their doubt upon you stand strong knowing that you care not for their pageantry but care only for doing what is right doing what is true there s nothing else to do if good is what you seek to do do not allow people who are unable to meet their own standards to get into your head use your knowledge to rise above their fud trust as few people as possible only those who have truly proved themselves worthy of your trust and even then be prepared for those you trust to disgrace you be prepared for anything to happen do not let it make you falter rather take it up in flames and use it as fuel to burn your own internal fire of your desire virtue is enough thank you for your work i believe that ethereum has given humanity the utility to effectively create platforms which incentivise cooperation and unity amongst individuals who comprise the userbase of said platforms this is an unprecedented opportunity to seize the means of the new web based economy in order to do what is right we are in the middle of a financial revolution all across humanity the internet is a means of infrastructure that is effectively connecting the world into a singularity that singularity is either going to be taken over by the good guys or the bad guys this is our time to stand up against the injustice that we are passively eating up every day of our godforsaken lives enough this is the best chance that we could ever possibly hope for to have the tools at our disposal to revolt against the despicable and swinish how by implementing sustainable energy infrastructure by incentivising cooperation by taxing the elites universal basic income schemes wholesome culture respect for work life balance respect for virtuous values contempt for hoggery or stupidity why hold ourselves back why give in to our primitive desires at least why to the degree that we allow our primitive desires to become our main focus this is degrading to the self our primary focus only needs to be to do what is right and what is right is whatever we consider as the virtuous decision to make in a given situation i think that a more sane version of gratifying our primitive desires is to allow virtuous efforts to bring our satisfaction to us doing this requires the alignment of what you consider to be gratifying with what reality is confronting you with it is possible for as long as you tell yourself it is i wanted to take a moment to give thanks to all of those who comprise this enterprise the haters and the lovers the yin and the yang the fuel and the fire i love every single one of you down to the core of your soul never give up the fight for what is right the past has handed us divinity and it is up to us to preserve it up to us to live for it up to us to die for it memento mori protect one another for we are all part of the same thing there is nothing separating us spacetime connects us to each other spacetime itself is part of what we all together are what we do to spacetime we do to ourselves there is nothing separating the spacetime we experience from our idea of our self the self is merely the manifestation of all spacetime that has been projected onto it without the outside there would be no inside and yet there are neither as they are each one and the same the logos permeates all knows no bounds follow the guidance of your intuition harmonise with that which you consider to be right always open to correction from the truth for freedom virtue amp one another i love you 	2

hi i don t know if this idea has been pursued or not but i was thinking of a way to bring ethereum transactions to those without internet access i m thinking about using mesh networks is this idea plausible it would only make sense in highly populated cities as the range is limited and i know it s not really practical because public wifi is relatively common i just don t know if it s technically possible amp x200b the idea is that users with an internet connection act as a hotspot for users without internet access over radio which are nearby would it be possible for offline users to send receive transactions over a p2p radio mesh network 	1

i am not anti parity so please spare me the parity has done a tremendous amount for ethereum i know that but i am pro economic incentives and rational unemotional economic incentives should be something many around here understand or at least try to given that they are critical to the operation of cryptocurrency blockchains so let s just look at the incentives as the primary developers of polkadot with many of their devs holding a substantial amount of dots parity has a huge financial incentive for ethereum to fall behind on its eth 2 0 and eth 1 x roadmaps if ethereum does fall behind it provides polkadot with more of a chance for polkadot to become more prominent for certain use cases either by seizing existing market share of ethereum or to expand the market in ways that benefit them perhaps before ethereum could do so such a situation would inevitably boost the value of dots there may be room for multiple projects in this space but a big part of ethereum s value proposition is having a critical mass of activity upon it via l1 and l2 fragmenting economic activity across multiple networks is detrimental to that important network effect at this point polkadot claims to be complementary to ethereum but how i mean really how not hand waving and hugs how what value are they adding to ethereum that l2 and eth 2 0 can t achieve is their only value that they plan to be interoperable with ethereum if so i see how this benefits polkadot but i do not see how it benefits ethereum if they really wanted to complement ethereum why aren t they launching as an l2 upon it why does polkadot need to be an l1 what are ways in which these financial incentives might be counter balanced 1 the holders of dots also hold a lot of eth but this is not perfect as dots with a relatively small ico valuation compared to current eth market cap may have easier accessible upside in this way holding an equivalent amount of eth to dots in fiat terms could really be viewed as an insurance policy against polkadot failing 2 polkadot demonstrates how it really is a complement to ethereum and not just a leech upon it i don t know how but they need to show that they are dependent upon ethereum s success in order for them to succeed so far i do not see this vision sorry those are just the facts as inconvenient as they may be i don t know what to do about them but ignoring potentially perverse incentives behind one of the most important ethereum development organizations is probably not the best approach not everyone is going to win in this market and seeing a potentially vc controlled coin with on chain governance as a big winner is not something i really care about that s not why i became interested in this space in the first place 	2

according to preston vanloon of prysmatic labs serenity will have 1024 shards 111 validators per committee 113 664 validators at the start and 3 637 246 eth locked up at the start assuming an ether supply of 110 million post serenity it appears only 3 3 of all ether will be able to participate at the beginning of serenity the number of validators then is highly misleading since users with vastly larger sums of ether will dominate the probability distribution due to stake splitting so for example users with 100 000 ether will have 3 125 opportunities to be selected compared to the baseline average which is likely a single user with a single opportunity to be selected due to having only the bare minimum of 32 ether accordingly we don t know how many unique validators there will be as those with the largest shares will radically out compete the little guys this seems especially problematic given how a single computer can run multiple validator instances which reduces key obstacles for larger stakers based on these rough estimations it seems to me the validator pool while seemingly quite large to naive observers will in reality be extremely narrow that is one could easily imagine there being less than 100 unique persons controlling the consensus process considering the pseudonymous and starkly unbalanced nature of the coin distribution at genesis while i understand these limitations may only be at the start and greater participation might be possible later on that doesn t actually reassure me regardless of how one massages these numbers the fact remains that the vast majority of users will be unable to participate in a fair manner in the consensus process i find this to be an unacceptable trade off don t take this the wrong way but this seems like a serious flaw and likely vector of centralization in the present design am i reading this situation accurately if not why not and if so what are some pragmatic solutions to increase to actual success rate of participation in a post serenity world i d appreciate an open and critical discussion on this topic 	1

so we all know security is so difficult with all the zero day exploits and skids out there amp x200b recently the parity attack vector was exposed as leaving not just rpc users vulnerable but anyone with a poorly configured router amp x200b it occurred to me how the emphasis on making people responsible to harden their own network was glazed over in favor of coding something less susceptible to what is commonly found in the field as the network security equivalent of what we use to strain boiled pasta amp x200b i ve outlined some simple steps one can take below to seem a less inviting target amp x200b 1 if you must use your isp provided kit as a wireless gateway and modem at least minimize the scope of your wifi range there is no reason to project a 2 4ghz signal in a 3 block radius when a 5ghz signal at half strength will reach every corner of your home and slightly beyond amp x200b 2 the more common the hardware the most likely it s been disseminated for exploits that are readily available to apply it s best to have a router that routes a wap that handles wifi and switches that will expand your network small office commercial grade stuff is what you want and even then ensure you change the default login credentials you would be surprised how many don t heed this advice change your ip i e if you normally access 192 168 1 1 over http try to enable https connections to 192 168 2 42 over port 88 instead also don t just change the password but the login name as well every little bit helps amp x200b 3 ensure remote logins are disabled disable upnp if at all possible and forwarding and set your dns away from what your isp uses to the more secure opendns 208 67 220 220 208 67 222 222 google 8 8 8 8 8 8 4 4 or cloudflare 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 servers which will help mitigate mitm attempts amp x200b 4 keep your firmware up to date enable your router firewall also ensure your pc has a firewall installed instructions for debian or ubuntu users below amp x200b adding a very

 u dcinvestor recently made an excellent post about the incentives of parity but i was disappointed by the comments as someone who has taken pride in the community s collaborative and accommodating nature it was heartbreaking to see people immediately reach for their pitchforks about parity it gave me flashbacks to how the bitcoin schism started can we do better job as a community to have even headed discussion like u dcinvestor i m also not anti parity i respect what they ve done for the community i also hope that they can continue to contribute as they have done so willingly in the past like u dcinvestor i work in an industry that requires thorough disclosures and avoidance of conflict of interest so i understand the need to align incentives between parties in the market i also empathize with those frustrated about parity recently it s unfortunate that u 5chdn has made strident remarks against the eth2 0 roadmap and that parity has been the source of some recent bugs in software that being said i believe we re actively destroying the community when we re holding up parity and its developers to a paragon of virtue that will never be realistic once we start the salem witch trials for anyone who has any hint of a conflict of interest we will have no community left we will become like bitcoin core all over again here s the unpleasant truth conflict of interest will always exist especially in a community like ethereum that espouses to not be chain maximalist don t hate the player hate the game we ve always encouraged projects like polkadot and others like cosmos if you want to give parity crap about starting polkadot you also have to start questioning the community s values for a multi chain future in fact many of the comments in the attached thread did exactly that now i believe it s fair to be skeptical of this approach especially when naively following it will encourage bad actors but i also think we need to keep in mind why we created this approach in the first place it comes down to innovation innovation in the bitcoin community ground to a halt when people began branding every alternative take as a shitcoin conversely research in areas adjacent to ethereum has exploded because we ve continually welcomed teams like eos iota cosmos and polkadot to build erc 20 tokens on top their research successes and failures will benefit ethereum just as ethereum s scale benefits them another unpleasant truth the eth2 0 development is still extremely experimental and fraught with risk eth2 0 developers and the ef may have a clear vision about ethereum s future but there s no guarantee that it ll come to fruition what if the current sharding spec fails and we have to redesign it wouldn t it be better to have adjacent experiments with concrete results that can point us in the right direction i believe many people here have an incorrect perspective of research driven projects ground breaking research flourishes an open and accepting environment for competing visions not with a couple of researchers burying their heads in a problem with monomaniacal focus and let s be honest ethereum needs the research just as much as everyone else it s easy to accept these principles when ethereum is doing well but it s most important to accept them when ethereum is not doing well and yes ethereum has not had its best few months lately at least in the court of public opinion the delay of constantinople continued stagnation of price and concerns about roadmap completion have made it hard to stick to our open minded philosophy however this does not mean we should push our frustrations on developers and hold them to unrealistic standards one final uncomfortable fact parity is not the only one with conflicts of interest vlad zamfir sits on the board for rchain a separate blockchain with no affiliation to ethereum he presumably has a big stake in rchain and he s also been critical of ethereum in the past calling it shitty software wouldn t he stand to benefit if ethereum fails as well ethereum s research partners for zk snarks have zcash could their work with us merely be a ploy for further pr on zcash i bring up these examples not because i think there s a slippery slope this is a logical fallacy i bring these examples up because i believe the most productive line of conversation first starts with revisiting our community values and standard of ethics before we give parity a fair chance at explaining themselves as we consider parity s position we need to apply their standard of behavior to all the other people who are not under trial we don t want to set bad precedents that then lead us down the dark road of radicalization parity also deserves the benefit of a doubt because they ve contributed to the community for so long even before the 5m grant they re the 2 node software for a reason and we can t neglect that fact when we consider their case one last tangential note i recently read about russian strategies to destabilize communities on social media apparently one of their favorite strategies was to log onto their site and post very radical statements that supposedly support the community e g on a anti trump site they might spam messages that trump is a fascist these statements would disgust the more moderate members of the community leading the community to fracture into smaller less influential elements i bring this up because we re essentially doing the same thing to ourselves right now by accusing parity and folks like afri of a conspiracy without conclusive evidence and due process we re nothing better than a mob looking for a witch to burn i think we can do better than that i m sure you do too article for reference amp

so not too long ago i made an account on the exchange crex24 for some reason i had hundreds of shares of a token called thorecoin thr is the symbol on said exchange this token was valued at around 30 cents during this time unfortunately i had a student loan that needed a payment to be made so i cashed out thr for a couple hundred dollars to cover what was needed here thr is a few weeks months whatever later and one single share is 500 dollars i feel sick that i would have had a few hundred thousand dollars as opposed to just a few hundred dollars if it wasn t for needing immediate cash did i miss an opportunity here or is this too fishy where crex24 would never have let me see this money thanks 	1
it is in my opinion that the next big financial crisis will likely be due to the surmounting student loan debt or maybe auto loans this post is not intended to explain why this potential crisis will arise or even what will happen but more of a how can we blockchain help stop this in short are there any ideas or protocols being explored or built that aim to tackle this challenge personally i have no idea well maybe a few wild ones of how defi could potential thwart this upcoming disaster but was curious to hear from the community amp x200b 	1

over a year ago christian lundkvist u christianlundkvist came up with a very elegant idea for a simplified rock solid multisig wallet exploring simpler ethereum multisig contracts amp x200b a few months ago mr lundkvist updated his multisig wallet contract to comply with eip 712 standard for signing typed structured data i haven t seen any user interface front end for the updated contract so i put this one together amp x200b the user interface is spartan but functional in particular it has the following functions create deploy a wallet with just a few key strokes add edit labels for the owner addresses save wallet data as a json string import a deployed wallet from the blockchain or json string create a simple transaction with just a few keystrokes sign a transaction eip 712 save import transaction data including any signatures from to json execute a transaction when there are sufficient signatures ens lookups where ethereum addresses are accepted amp x200b the ability to save transaction data as json seemed necessary to me since different owners will need a convenient way to pass transactions around while collecting signatures amp x200b the front end is on ipfs amp x200b and the source code my fork of mr lundkvist s repository is on github cheers ad	1
hey all i am new to this forum although have been using and developing a bit decentralised apps for 2 3 years now i am wondering how do people get tokens in the first place to start using dapps and how to you get your money back into fiat after can you give examples from your personal experience dapps usually assume that you have some kind of tokens in the first place do you guys see this as a problem 	1
last year 2018 a group of doctors saw ethereum as a goldmine and started an ico they accepted seed round funds and promised funds would be used for development of their telemedicine platform they immediately hit a speed bump with the ico collapse but continued to promise that the further rounds of investment would take place once they had clarity regarding the laws regarding fund raising amp x200b questions arose from investors as to the legality of the platform and regulations but were always shot down as the founders were doctors and knew what they were doing delays continued and founders made augur bets on minor development goals to prove things were on track when challenged with the ethics of using investor funds to gamble and multiply funds they removed any mention of doing so then things continued delays excuses and messages communication slowed to a trickle amp x200b fast forward to 2019 in january major investor revolts started to bubble up in the telegram group and user numbers dropped daily there was 0 trading volume on their own protocol despite claims of activity from the founders as of march 9th the founders muted the telegram group and sent emails to those who invested saying that they will reimburse investors in the currency of investment amp x200b this reimbursement is based on ethereum paid to the founders in 2018 at price highs and now depreciated to less than half of the original value the founders are licensed medical professionals in the us us citizens and are hiding behind a company formed in malta as a defense for their liabilities the website for the project is and the founding partners can be found at amp x200b this post is not made to start a mob rush but to provide a repository of information for those who invested and now have no means of contact before taking any action seek legal counsel as this will most likely require sec action and filings tl dr freezing the telegram chat and now refunding investors with depreciated eth rather than giving their tokens or the money back this is after a year s delay following a seed round medxprotocol is making a bad situation worse ico shameless amp x200b 	1
hi there so i have a ledger nano s since almost a year ago i think but when i tried to update the device to firmware v1 5 5 the usb cable got disconnected by accident and it cancelled the update ofcourse now after unplugging and retrying i couldn t get back on my ledger because it shows something called bootloader on the device now i took the steps explained on their website to fix this ans after fixing the bootloader problem a new error occured on the ledger screen mcu firmware not genuine so i tried everything they suggested on their website and send alot of emails back and forth with ledger support but nothing seems to work so basicly i get the bootloader error and after fixing that it gives me the mcu not genuine error but i simply can t fix that problem also when i unplug the ledger nano s with the mcu not genuine error on screen and plug it back in i get the bootloader error again i have tried literally everything suggested on their website every step also restarted the device in unsafe mode ams deleted all apps on there doesn t work disabled my anti virus and firewall updated my usb ports and am not using vpn also closed any unneccesary programs on my pc that could interfere with the ledger all as suggested by ledger support again nothinf works and i keep getting these bootloader and mcu not genuine error messages still unable to acces my ledger wallet all of this because my usb cable got disconnected during an update i don t see this become mainstream when something so small can couse u to be unable to acces your funds any help would be greatly appreciated 	1

after reading this recent article by ccnmarkets i have come to realize that to stand in solidarity with the rest of the ethereum community s call for a unified code of conduct there are things i need to address myself as the founder and ceo of mew being public and transparent without hurting innocent people is important it conveys our shared values and points the way toward a more cooperative community debate informed by the competition of ideas and quality of work must be what defines our community and those ideals are undermined by false narratives and personal attacks i am disappointed that certain parties have perceived my silence as a weakness and have taken advantage of it to spread misinformation about my involvement with mew until now i admit that i have been quiet but steadfast in my ultimate pursuit of building better and more useful products and features that will enrich the ethereum community in time however remaining silent while others are on the offensive truly does a disservice to my team and to the community i care very much about those that know me understand that i am a very reserved person by nature but i can no longer permit false information about me and my company to be spread on various mediums and outlets i feel compelled and encouraged in this action by the ethereum community s code of conduct itself which states gt we encourage you to promote this code and take action especially if you are in a leadership position to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed ethereum community s code of conduct v1 i feel that the statements made by my former business partner and mycrypto ceo taylor monahan u insomniasexx in the ccn interview mischaracterize my involvement with mew as well as the reasons behind the end of our partnership and her departure from mew throughout that difficult time i remained dedicated to mew s vision and contribution to the ethereum community at large i also must clarify that past and present employees of mew have always been paid by the company no evidence has ever been brought to my attention that taylor paid employees out of her own pocket nor has that claim ever been made to me prior to the publication of the piece in ccn furthermore there would have been no reason for anyone to use their own funds to cover payroll as myetherwallet was well funded at the time the coding side of mew was single handedly programmed by me long before taylor left mew and started her own company i have remained committed to the development of user friendly ethereum solutions and today mew is flourishing with three core products all of them came to life since taylor s departure built by a strong team that has been with the project for the majority as of now over a year of its lifetime we would not be where we are today without the hard work and countless late nights spent on building mew by this team from early 2018 up until now this is another reason why i refuse to sit in silence while my team and the company to which they have dedicated themselves are presented falsely and disrespectfully to the media and the community moreover i think it s rather telling that most if not all of the developers from mew s early team who continued work with mycrypto after taylor s departure from mew have moved on to other ventures and are no longer with either project i continue to wish these talented individuals the very best as they work to build great things in this space finally it s worth noting that not just myetherwallet s twitter account but any account that represents a company in this space should be considered as part of the company s brand rather than anyone s personal twitter account maintaining it in such a manner helps to boost user confidence which is essential in our industry at the end of the day we are all working towards improving the ethereum ecosystem and this purpose is beyond personal preferences communication styles or complicated backstories the image presented by the members of the ethereum community to the wider world will have a tremendous effect on the adoption of the blockchain users and outside experts can t have confidence in the transparency and integrity of our products if we don t hold ourselves and our peers to the same standards i am hopeful that this initiative to agree on and maintain a universal code of conduct will allow the community to focus more fully on bringing innovations to the blockchain technology which is what brought us here together in the first place 	1

this is going to be a post about cryptoeconomics i hope the moderators will allow this to be posted to r ethereum because cryptoeconomics is at the core of the success or failure of any decentralized crypto project including ethereum i will discuss price but only in reference to the cryptoeconomic factors contributing to the success of ethereum the motivation for writing this post came about because i have been hearing and reading a lot of people involved with ethereum who seem to feel that price isn t important or needed for ethereum to succeed i even heard this sentiment stated by one of the main speakers at ethdenver last month i aim to show in this post that this viewpoint is very much incorrect and that a high and increasing price of ether over time is a critical component to achieving success for the ethereum platform first of all the very fact that ethdenver exists is a function of the fact that there are thousands of people being paid to write code targeting ethereum wallets clients exchanges smart contracts vertically integrated dapps etc in some cases the funding for those salaries comes directly from the millions of dollars investors made in the last price cycle while in others it comes from vc and other investors building on ethereum who are looking forward to future large scale growth in ethereum mostly driven by growth of the value of ether and other tokens running on ethereum this is the virtuous cryptonomic cycle an increasing ether price brings more projects and developers which leads to more network effects and value to the entire ecosystem secondly ethereum needs to do very well in the crypto marketplace to continue to attract future talent investment and network effects if ethereum slips to the 10 crypto asset it will have far fewer people choosing to build on ethereum those projects and developers instead looking to build on platforms with better future prospects for becoming the global financial backbone for decentralized applications finally a high price of ether provides security for the ethereum chain it funds mining hardware and electricity in the pow phase of ethereum and directly secures the chain in the proof of stake phase ethereum has the potential one day of securing a significant fraction of all digital financial assets on a single platform of sharded ledgers and smart contracts if those assets are worth trillions of dollars then ethereum needs to be worth enough so that it is not viable to attack those assets by attacking the underlying ethereum cryptoeconomic system to summarize when some people in the ethereum community denigrate ether investors say that ethereum can work fine with the price of ether at 10 and that a strong and growing price of ether isn t important they are way off base the price of ether is critical to the success of ethereum this virtuous cycle also explains why the value of the ether token is important to the entire ethereum community and why some people react quite negatively to attempts to siphon value from eth and accrue it to competitors instead those attempts if successful will damage the future success of the entire community 	1

evolution planet is the first virtual planet game to use game asset management as a new nuclear game it is also the first open platform and autonomous ecosystem based on blockchain dedicated to blockchain game development operation and resource integration amp x200b two industry pain points amp x200b 1 the existing blockchain game is still driven by speculative psychology focusing only on the money making effect amp x200b 2 the game category is single and the playability is poor amp x200b 3 mainly for digital currency players it is difficult to attract real game users to enter amp x200b the vision of the evolutionary planet to achieve a new blockchain game ecology by connecting with other game system networks blockchain games ip and dapp zero barriers by means of cross chain sidechain etc amp x200b interpretation bridging different games through cross chain sidechain etc creates a larger game ecology which is the vision of many blockchain games however the current technical difficulty is relatively large not only for the project team of the evolutionary planet can we wait and see amp x200b three game world view amp x200b evolutionary planet s game world view is divided into geography chemistry physics economics and social views and is constructed very reasonably amp x200b 1 geography the evolutionary planet is set as a planet with 26 continents 24 of which contain 2025 45 45 plots and the other two special continents contain 7921 22 360 1 plots block the total number of plots is 64442 blocks amp x200b interpretation compared to other sandbox games the number of plots on the evolutionary planet is still scarce for example neoworld which has recently been on fire has a total of 280 000 7 40000 land on seven continents the setting of the evolutionary planet s official 26 continents is not easy the original intention may be to access more public and external game ecosystems in the future but the speed and method of opening up the mainland requires reasonable planning the opening of the mainland too fast or too slow may affect the interests of players and the future development of the game amp x200b 2 chemistry it contains five basic elements gold wood water fire and earth the properties of different plots are different and the rate and number of generation of various elements are also different the basic elements can synthesize higher level composites with a certain amount of proportions and the composites can produce higher grade composites the production and use of advanced props requires the same level of elements amp x200b interpretation the setting of the chemistry concept adopts the five line design in traditional chinese culture compared with the setting of steel wood and stone directly used in ordinary mines in neowold it is closer to the idea of the game world moreover the five line element superimposed composite certificate makes the props for the player s personalized development in the game more abundant amp x200b 3 physics each plot is 100 100 meters in size and has no height limit in this parcel space players can construct buildings due to the location and distance evolutionary planets can be introduced to transport and transport workers amp x200b 4 economic outlook amp x200b 1 system pass model amp x200b ring is the system of evolutionary planet with a total cap of 10 billion the first mainland issued 2 billion and the supply of the xth ring is amp x200b amp x200b on october 10th the official wechat group of evolution planet announced the system revenue source and distribution plan amp x200b interpretation evolutionary planet uses the bancor protocol for token exchange bancor everyone knows that unlike the original ai siou cut amaranth both the user and the project side must have a human machine transaction a two way exchange and the evolution of the planet s project is obviously more confidence in the project itself but also dispelled concerns that players are worried that the project side will cut the leek directly however the release of ring takes the form of deflation on a continent by continental basis this is somewhat unfriendly to the players who come in later the release of ring on the a continent and the g continent is doubled the final release of the mainland is only 8 million if the project side does not balance the progress of the project and the timing of the opening of the mainland it is likely to affect the future attractiveness of the evolutionary planet amp x200b 2 element resource pass model amp x200b the release of elemental resources will be determined by the parcel attributes the release rate of the five resources and the player s industrial activity indicators amp x200b amp x200b interpretation due to the evolution of the elemental resources release by the evolutionary planet it is necessary for the landlord not only to pay attention to the reasonable matching between different elements but also to pay attention to the rational planning of the building placement so as to achieve the process of maximizing production optimization of the release of element resources if you just build without a brain the gains you get may be far below the optimal situation amp x200b 3 composite certificate model amp x200b the release model of the composite pass is completely dependent on the market supply and demand the generation of the pass means that the corresponding number of elements are destroyed and the destruction of the pass can bring the corresponding number of elements to be restored amp x200b box a variety of basic composites also the basic unit of the building amp x200b building it consists of a square and a building model the squares form part of the building and the building model represents the space design of the building the building can be removed and restored to a square by paying a certain depreciation fee when a building is worn other players can provide the creator with a cloning fee to create the same building amp x200b props created by the mainland developers and defines the resources or benefits that the props can represent amp x200b external props third party blockchain game assets props such as encrypted cats can also be connected to the evolutionary planet as a game prop of the evolutionary planet amp x200b transportation the location of the resource or item with location information is transferred and the handling fee ring is required for transportation the farther away the higher the handling fee amp x200b interpretation the setting of the composite pass has made the evolution of the planet become very diverse in addition to the classic landlord and part time play you can get the benefits of ring by designing a personalized architectural model or other equity props the traditional gameplay is too monotonous on the one hand and it is easy to form conflicts of interest between players of different roles on the other hand the choice of composite pass provided by evolutionary planet is conducive to building a more reasonable game ecology amp x200b 5 social view the user s account can be associated with a professional role at the same time such as miners exercise workers construction workers transport workers etc the landlord does not belong to the system occupation the specific occupation will obtain the productivity efficiency attributes such as proficiency according to the basic attribute addition props service age and other parameters when the user changes the occupation the new occupation has zero continuous time and low proficiency establish a credible voting mechanism by developing a scalable blockchain voting system amp x200b three game design amp x200b the official white paper introduces the classic gameplay amp x200b interpretation players who have played games in my world and games like neoworld may not be familiar with these gameplays the landlords and migrant workers in the early bonus period are cooperative and the income of both parties is very high with the end of the dividend period the income of both parties will gradually decrease and after the number of landowners is saturated the increase in the number of migrant workers will inevitably lead to the opposition between the two after that if the project party and the player can t increase the playability by developing other gameplay the game s ecology may continue to deteriorate amp x200b in addition to the resources and gameplay built into evolution planet system developers or third party developers can also access evolutionary planet games by developing a variety of game dapps amp x200b amp x200b interpretation at present these peripheral dapps are still in the concept stage if the follow up of the game ecology and the growth of user traffic continue to connect these dapps to the evolutionary planet that means that each of us can be in the world of evolutionary planets opening a bank running a government competing for an arena etc it is quite exciting to think about it amp x200b four design principles amp x200b minimize principle amp x200b 2 service api amp x200b 3 sustainable amp x200b 4 upgradeable amp x200b interpretation in addition to the technical architecture of the evolutionary planet the official white paper also introduces the darwin network and interstellar asset coding standards because these partial technical aspects are difficult for ordinary players to understand and do not know and will not affect the game experience so i will not go into details here amp x200b this game guide comes from godapp amp x200b amp x200b 	1

what attending events in the crypto space means to most of us is that it is a perfect chance to get the most up to date info about leading and emerging projects be it their technology progress or their business and community development roadmaps so edcon team would like to make a series announcements about the main contents of the speech of our speakers which might be the biggest concern to most of our attendees amp x200b processing img klufbbkb92m21 amp x200b see the announcement 1 2 amp 3 amp x200b 28 speaker felix leupold gnosis topic d usion a scalable fair exchange brief centralized exchanges can be exploited by strategies like arbitrage trading or front running today s decentralized exchanges are solely non custodial trades are still settled via pseudo continuous order books reserving the ability to front run and arbitrage trades introducing d usion a fully decentralized exchange that moves beyond these limitations d usion collects limit orders for many token pairs in discrete batches and clears all trades at the same arbitrage free price it achieves scalability through the use of succinct zero knowledge proofs zksnarks these proofs can be provided by all participants in the network removing the need for a single operator amp x200b 29 speaker brett robertson ethereum cat herders topic the ethereum cat herders project management in a decentralised ethereum brief ethereum has grown rapidly in the last few years and now has many branches working on different areas all for a common goal as projects grow and develop they can experience some teething issues most of which can be addressed by better coordination and communication in a large open source globally decentralised project of nascent technology this can be hard this exactly what the ethereum cat herders are keen to address to help drive ethereum forward amp x200b 30 speaker mo dong celer network topic build and operate internet scale dapps on celer network brief despite its high potentials off chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved for example how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on chain operations how to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks how to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off chain dapps how to guarantee that off chain states are always available for possible disputes in this talk mo will describe how celer network solves these challenges celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off chain state transitions a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state of the art solutions a powerful development framework and runtime for off chain dapps and an incentive aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off chain state availability he will provide their vision for celer network 2 0 a grand unification of all off chain scaling technologies into a single solution amp x200b 31 speaker zeming yu cover more insurance topic an introduction to security token offerings brief zeming will talk about the use of ethereum within the security token offering space amp x200b 32 speaker michael yuan second state amp cybermiles foundation topic creating a rules language for the ethereum virtual machine brief smart contracts are immutable programs on the blockchain they are automatically executed based on pre defined rules however complex and inferencing rules could be extremely difficult to program test and validate using standard programming languages like solidity the long sequence of highly nested if then statements is fragile and error prone the problem is compounded by the need to frequently change rules based on business requirements past enterprise software vendors have long relied on business rules engines bres to solve this problem bres allow business analysts to write transactional state changing programs in a specialized programming language called formal rules language which can be generated by graphical user interfaces bres automatically evaluate re evaluate and execute those rules they have been proven successful in traditional financial services with the open source lity project we have developed extensions to solidity and the evm to support a bre for smart contracts in this presentation michael will discuss the benefits and use cases of rules language and engine for smart contracts especially in the context of financial services applications he will further describe how the rules language is designed and implemented including compiler and virtual machine runtime support amp x200b 33 speaker benjamin hause hyperlink technology topic introducing brownie brief benjamin will

 who remembers what domain investing was like in the 1990s or early 2000s new digital real estate was being created from scratch and sold launching an entirely new purely digital asset class and as the internet filled up with new websites premier domains began to shoot up in value some companies in the com era may have succeeded largely due to their domain and its primacy in search results today this market has become stagnant but innovation is popping up in a new area blockchain domains 1 new domain extensions if there s one thing that blockchains are great at it s permissionless innovation new blockchain domain services can just launch on a public blockchain no icann approval necessary 2 payments are native another thing blockchains are pretty great at is payments so what if i told you that your blockchain domain will replace your cryptocurrency addresses for payments rather than sharing your bitcoin eth and other addresses when you want to get paid just share yourname zil now when i go into a wallet to pay you i type yourname zil choose from a list of currencies you accept and pay not only is this is a way to replace long addresses but it s also a way to easily accept any cryptocurrency if you just want to receive whatever currency is easiest for folks who pay you then set up your domain so you accept all of the top cryptocurrencies 3 censorship resistance with blockchain domains the user stores the domain asset themselves inside of their cryptocurrency wallet in the same way they store cryptocurrencies blockchain domains are just assets on top of a smart contract platform like ethereum the only way to move a blockchain domain or change what information it points to would be to control the private key of the wallet this is completely different than with traditional domains where registrars like godaddy amp google domains are the holders of your domain asset so the next step after domain custody is to make it easy to build censorship resistant websites right now users could point their blockchain domains to content stored on a self hosted server or a decentralized storage network that means that today it is possible to have both a domain asset and a website associated with it that can t be taken down blockchain domains could be a much bigger asset class than current domains this is due to 1 new features payments and censorship resistance solve huge problems that exist with current domains turning them into global permissionless tools for business 2 new users traditional domains are for businesses but everyone will need a blockchain domain to pay and get paid there s a consumer and a business use for blockchain domains so we could easily see 3 billion instead of 300 million traditional domains 3 portability the entire current dns infrastructure could easily port from the current centralized dns registry to a public blockchain at any point in the future eventually blockchain naming systems will be the tech of choice gt the zilliqa foundation is partnering with unstoppable domains to launch zil a new blockchain domain system the system will launch on zilliqa and is the first blockchain domain system to support payments in multiple cryptocurrencies all to one domain unstoppable domains is building domains on blockchains based in san francisco the company has received funding from boost vc and grants from both the ethereum foundation and the zilliqa foundation when the system is launched in june a public auction will begin for all remaining domains bidding starts at 10 bids are public and they must be at least 2 larger than the previous bid the auction will take place on the blockchain and anyone can participate at launch zil domains will support multiple cryptocurrencies this means that users can add all their bitcoin ethereum litecoin and zilliqa addresses to one domain to pay someone opens up their wallet types in yourname zil selects from a list of currencies that your domain supports and pays you can open your account here and grab that perfect domain zil name while its available cheers 	2

as i ve delved more into the economics of pow and pos i ve become increasingly concerned with that pos is not a viable alternative most of the concerns are outlined here amp x200b one of the key advantages to pow is it incentivizes miners to advance their hardware to be as fast and energy efficient as possible as we all know the problem with pow is it also inevitably leads to absurd energy consumption because even as miners are rewarded for energy efficiency new miners will enter the maker and increase competition until the cost of burnt energy is again just below the mining reward amp x200b i m interested to hear if anyone in the community has heard proposals to do a blend of pos and pow i ve heard some discussion of changing what the task in pow is for example to change the task from a brute force endurance task like current mining to perhaps rewarding short bursts of speed a computational marathon vs a sprint can anyone point towards good write ups of possible solutions 	1

i am a believer in total supply market caps instead of circulating supply market caps and truth be told market cap metrics are not that great of an evaluation tool for cryptos anyways however i know people like to see a total value number fair enough i ve tried to spread the word and awareness regarding not using circulating supply as circulating supply can be easily manipulated and deceiving i personally view circulating supply market cap as a marketing technique for the crypto industry lots of folks use cmc and are not aware that its simply a joke to use circulating supply imo case in point grin cmc has it ranked at 193 messari which uses total supply has it ranked at 6 so if you judge a coin by its true valuation total supply then you are assuming grin is a top 6 coin me thinks i will short the shit out of grin if i knew how to however most folks will look at cmc and see a coin with lots of room to grow which it actually doesnt its topped out no where to go but down imo curious of what you all think about the discrepancy in market cap numbers for a coin like grin cheers wcw	1

what attending events in the crypto space means to most of us is that it is a perfect chance to get the most up to date info about leading and emerging projects be it their technology progress or their business and community development roadmaps amp x200b so edcon team would like to make a series announcements about the main contents of the speech of our speakers which might be the biggest concern to most of our attendees see the announcement 1 2 3 amp 4 amp x200b 34 speaker guillaume felley liquidity network topic nocust a securely scalable commit chain brief commit chains are layer 2 solutions to scale blockchains he will present how commit chains such as nocust operate in a trustless and secure manner while still allowing a large transaction throughput such constructions are also an opportunity to fix some of the major user experience issues with blockchain commit chain transactions are instant and do not require to pay any gas fees amp x200b 35 speaker matan field daostack topic buidling scalable daos brief daos have long been hovering in the crypto minds and many believe 2019 would be the year we ll see some of them coming alive we don t expect a one shape fit them all but rather they ll likely to appear in different flavors and sizes in this talk matan will describe the buidling blocks of daos their architectural layers governance modules and the holographic consensus protocol needed to push them up to large scale i ll present alchemy an interface for generic daos on the ethereum mainnet and if the crypto god will be with me i ll also be able to present a real living dao baby but walking and talking amp x200b 36 speaker peter pan metacartel topic state of the dapp ecosystem brief we are entering a new inflection point in the ethereum dapp ecosystem where many pieces of dapp infrastructure are now slowly emerging into viability along with the maturity of a steady and fast growing native user base of ethereum dapps we are slowly accelerating into a new period of experimentation enabled by a maturing ecosystem we will slowly uncover the hidden mysteries of web 3 0 and have another crypto kitties moment that will change how we understand the nature of web 3 0 amp x200b 37 speaker parinya ekparinya university of sydney topic the attack of the clones against proof of authority brief in this talk parinya will present vulnerabilities and countermeasures of aura a recently proposed blockchain consensus based on proof of authority first he will explains how the aura consensus protocol actually works then the presentation introduces the cloning attack and show how to apply it to double spend with a single malicious node he will also discuss countermeasures to mitigate the risk of the cloning attack finally the talk explains that the attack can be generalised to clique amp x200b 38 speaker hannah glass king amp wood mallesons topic why blockchain governance needs more than just a token brief blockchain technologies are evolving rapidly to refocus on technology centric decentralised solutions many of these systems are governed by technological solutions which makes sense in a tech centric world significant work undertaken at the protocol layer is improving issues such as scalability and interoperability but whilst these solutions are technological in nature the problems are human scalability matters because people can t make payments in crypto when they want interoperability is a problem because it creates silos in an otherwise connected world not to mention that applications are built to allow humans to store files play games make investments and conduct a myriad of other activities purely technological solutions such as increasing block size creating wrapped tokens and smart contract architecture may improve upon the current situation but are unlikely to solve these problems in all circumstances the reason for this is because technology works well until it doesn t this is when governance matters most at its fundamental level governance is designed to manage the interactions between people it may well be invisible in the usual course of dealings but must act as a safety net when things go wrong as those problems may be technological in nature something more than just technology is likely to be needed this talk will examine how a co developed technological commercial and legal governance architecture can ensure that any solution is fit for purpose robust and resilient and enforceable even where there is a bug flaw or outage where problems are human to too must the solution amp x200b the next announcement of this series is coming soon please stay tuned write your comments below if you have any thoughts questions or doubts visit our webiste to get a tikcet and more info www edcon io follow edcon on the channels telegram twitter slack facebook 	1
 although the non fungible erc 721 token has offered improvements on erc 20 there are a few setbacks as coin telegraph explained in an article looking at alternatives to erc 20 advocates of this token protocol believe it could become the ultimate vehicle for putting every significant asset on a public or hybrid blockchain with 100 percent immutability and security non fungible tokens allow you to detail more of the attributes that make them special far beyond the name balance token supply and symbol this is because you can include rich metadata about an asset and include information about ownership and these authenticated details can ultimately add value because investors can be confident about its provenance that said there are downsides non fungible tokens have not been embraced as speedily as some advocates hoped in part because the erc 721 protocol is so new it can also be tricky and time consuming to develop decentralized applications for non fungible tokens properly 	1

 a non fungible token nft is an asset that represents something unique which means that it is not replaceable this makes it perfect for many use cases and applications on the blockchain for me the top 3 are 1 certificates the fields that handle certificates often face several issues frauds being the most sever non fungible tokens nfts can help introduce new trustless systems and efficiently reduce friction we can store all kinds of certificates from iso documents to academic credentials as nfts from there institutions can build new systems or upgrade the existing ones 2 collectibles by far this is currently the most popular use case for nfts kicked off by cryptokitties nfts can represent either digital of physical collectibles once tokenized they can be used in different models collectibles can represent in game items like a sword in a game or players within a fantasy football game the options are pretty much endless 3 digital art digital art is the growing field of digital media that can significantly leverage the nfts for their unique digital representations on the blockchain this way the market can leverage a more robust control over ownership and provenance of an artwork new user experiences can spring from this model and further expand this field in the public similarly in the real world art market an nft can become an ownership certificate for a specific piece of fine art there are limitless possibilities with blockchain and non fungible assets use case examples utm medium post amp utm source quora amp utm campaign answer amp x200b a question for you guys which industries should be tackled by non fungible tokens 	2

all the discussions around afri leaving the ethereum community got me thinking there were 3 main responses to the situation 1 people who saw no problem with afri s tweets cois and came to his defense many of whom know him on a personal level and could vouch for his character 2 people who had concerns with afri s cois or generally how we handle cois and expressed them fairly and reasonably to see how we could improve as a community 3 mostly anonymous people who had spammed reddit twitter with bullying personal attacks unfounded assumptions and hostility towards afri and then claimed censorship when their comments were removed note i sympathize with both 1 and 2 not taking a side here in this post amp x200b i was personally shocked by the magnitude of comments that i would classify in bucket 3 above is this a potential attack vector for ethereum amp x200b many leaders in our community are contributing in volunteer roles e g afri was release manager launched goerli etc and for these people to see the community turn on them with personal attacks can be disheartening and cause them to leave ethereum altogether in particular i believe we are significantly more vulnerable to this attack than centralized teams with smaller communities amp x200b one example of this is an anonymous user named andrew quentson who began spamming every public ethereum chatroom over the past few days it s a very cheap attack to perform but seems to be very effective at sowing discord and is contributing to a hostile them vs us feeling here who knows who could be the next dev to be targeted amp x200b thoughts is this something we should be concerned about and if so what should we do about it 	1

let me preface this by stating that i am not a maximalist may the best decentralized permission less blockchain protocol be widely adopted and may that result in an economic transformation that improves the world i don t care who builds it atm i think ethereum shows the most promise and it has the widest adoption however polkadot has an amazing dev team with og ethereum experience and it s no secret that polkadot devs think that polkadot might be better than serenity both projects are not complete so it s difficult to compare them however it seems that a key difference between the projects regards the heterogeneous consensus of parachains as opposed to the homogeneous consensus of serenity shards to me it seems like polkadot has a disadvantage here but i d be happy to be corrected if consensus mechanisms on polkadot parachains are variable then a valid but collusioned state on one parachain say a dpos parachain with back channel collusion or poor distribution can be bridged to other parachains and this would effectively compromise the consensus value of the other parachains it seems the solution would be governance around parachain inclusion but the downside would be that it would have to be either done reactively enacted after damage is done or proactively removing the permissionless aspect of the network 	1

dear members of the crypto community tl dr uninstall moon revoke your coinbase api keys now and protect your ethereum i am the co founder and cto at due to the unethical business practices moon technologies inc has been engaged in i have left the company as of today the moon browser extension manipulates the dom of all our users browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency over the past couple of months my co founder kenneth kruger has ordered the collection of data belonging to our users as a way to improve customer experiences none of our users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt out of tracking a feature which i regularly insisted should be added if you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under dated 26 feb 2019 you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions from the moment you install our browser extension we know exactly what pages are open on your browser what the content of those pages are and what you are doing with them the biggest and most alarming issue of all is the process of collection of how our browser extension works in the backend coinbase api keys from the moment the user initiates the connection between us and coinbase we watch for changes in the user s current window waiting for the user to complete the one time passcode otp verification process as required by coinbase once that is done we programatically click the required permissions scopes required to create the api key as moon sees fit the api key is then shown only once on the next screen but the user does not know this done via css manipulation we extract the api keys into our backend stored in plain text on our database this is a definite security antipattern as i m sure many of you know this api key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user when i asked my co founder why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking iam policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have personal access to our users api keys my co founder constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect our users only two days ago i have been locked out of my organization accounts including aws and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users if you are a user of our browser extension today please you need to uninstall the browser extension via chrome extensions and go into and revoke all your api keys now if you have not used the moon browser extension but know of a friend that might please inform him or her to do so immediately my deteriorating relationship with my co founder has grown to a point where it simply can no longer be contained you can read more about my experience in another post here i had created moon as i was crazy enough to think i was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency accelerating the future of the financial system however today is truly a sad day for crypto until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations the no accountability attitude and greed many executives possess we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency until we meet on the moon again please be safe not sorry alexander ang	2

why can t metamask or some other wallet service providers just create a version where they aggregate all the txs and send it all at once and confirm on mainnet in every few minute intervals using some sort of zk approach or other l2 scaling solutions they can still keep the current version for power users i would imagine most uses probably don t care whether their txs get confirmed in 15 seconds or 15 minutes as long as it s not taking hours or getting stuck in the queue that way most users can pay a constant low flat fee to transaction aggregators and aggregators although taking the market risk on gas price can profit from the fee difference in the long term maybe i m missing something important would be nice to hear some thoughts 	1

hello all i ve been building an online library dapp you can checkout the website i ve thrown together for it over at the idea is to make a product to access books and textbooks hosted on blockchain when i was a second year physics major short on money i challenged myself to spend as little as possible to buy the textbooks for my classes i found e book copies of them and while it was cheaper it wasn t always convenient i couldn t always pull it up when i needed to reference it in the middle of class it was difficult to take notes on particular sections without copying down a lot of information from the book for one particular lecture lab i had i wasn t able to find the lab manual so i had to borrow one from a friend and the e book sometimes proved hard to navigate through and flip quickly between sections from other physics majors i learned that people like to cross reference materials across multiple textbooks to better understand a concept the case that stands out is taylor and maclaurin series in calculus one textbook might provide a better conceptual understanding how taylor and maclaurin series are built from power series and how they can be used to approximate any function while another might offer a better practical walk through how to just get the right answer and together they give a more complete understanding to the reader the dapp i m working on would be capable of providing this capability by providing access to multiple textbooks on the same subject allowing users to pick and choose between several different textbooks based on what they re looking for i ve built a minimum viable interactive website to gauge the interest of my idea of providing an online library of general books comics and textbooks that users could borrow either to reference while they study or just as a blockchain library bookstore so far it only offers books available on the public domain for copyright reasons it s also currently using the rinkeby testnet so you don t need to spend any real money to test it out i m planning on expanding the selection in the future technology wise there is still a lot that needs to be improved but during this stage i would appreciate feedback and constructive criticism you guy have 	1

i just thought about this maybe someone could point out why this is infeasible user generates a proof that his address y has sent 1 eth to address x and that this tx has 6 confirmations contract address x is controlled by someone who wants to sell a token on a sidechain user submits proof to verifier contract on sidechain if sucessful this contract issues token to address y amp x200b i guess the verification of confirmations is the issue would the circuit become very big 	1

hello i have a question to submit to this community i have always looked at ethereum with great suspicion because it is a way to make things happen making a distributed database is obviously safer but how will distributed databases be able to compete in terms of efficiency with centralized ones it s a bit like the law of matter and light so the more mass of matter increases the faster you go how do you think ethereum solve this problem could you explain to me what scaling is how has it managed to scale the nodes that will act as pos will be chosen randomly because if they were always chosen the same would be as if they were centralized furthermore the pos does not make ethereum centralized will it hold heavy dapps with the pos you could explain these things to me i don t understand them by myself amp x200b 	1
please do not get me wrong i am not trying to troll or cause problems here honestly i just want to hear people s opinion about the progpow and current development amp x200b the main question here is why there are some people against progpow implementation i mean people have been saying pos is coming any upgrade would be waste of time for the last 2 years and honestly i don t feel like pos is coming soon so why do we keep delaying the progpow upgrade is it because it doesn t have the miners support or is it because it would take like 6 8 months to have this change so devs don t want to waste time on it or any other reason amp x200b don t get me wrong but i do not believe the argument pos is soon no need to work on such things as it is being said for over 2 years now 	2

it s not difficult to observe the repercussions of a system under which the incentive structure dictates that it s in the interest of big pharma and subsequently the medical research that they undertake to in fact prolong the of ailments of their customers in order to continue the sale of pharmaceutical products which are thus designed to supress ongoing symptoms rather than ever target the root problem or search for an underlying cure this is fundamentally due to a misaligned incentive structure that does not target medical research toward curing disease but rather to extend it i believe that it may be possible to restructure the incentives such that public funds could be paid out through a dao to medical researchers that actually target the root causes of disease and ultimately present a cure at a basic level the dao would allow anyone from around the world to contribute to funds focused on a specific disease eg cancer crohn s tb alzheimer s the common cold etc each fund would be a smart contract that could pay out according to any milestone or cure determined by the members of the dao contributors to a fund would become active members of the overall dao and able to participate in its governance and the creation and management of funds plausible 	2

 gt it is with much regret the co founders announce the closure of the acorn collective with immediate effect this has not been an easy decision and one that is the result of a great deal of consideration whilst this decision is a recent one the cause of it can be traced back many months gt gt for those who have been following us for a while you will know that our pre sale raised successfully this money s purpose was two fold firstly to promote the main sale later in 2018 and to enable us to deliver an mvp the main sale did not go well we expended a great deal of time and resources into making our main sale a success unfortunately the crypto market crashed like many ico s we also lost dollar value from the eth we had yet to convert to fiat this was compounded by two capital raisers also failing to produce and our main backer from the pre sale failing to deliver their promise of another fund injection investment in ico s had also dried up completely as we launched our main sale with eth falling by over 50 in that period gt gt the result of this was that we had to rig the operation differently to continue the project and deliver for our backers gt gt almost immediately two thirds of our team had to be laid off with the rest taking significant pay cuts focused solely on delivering the platform as promised we as co founders injected more of our own capital to ensure we delivered the platform for a long while it looked as if this was possible we are very proud of the team who have worked in extremely difficult conditions to produce an mvp that has a virtual accelerator crowdfunding platform and marketplace thus we are among a very small percentage of ico projects which actually delivered a product however sadly this had not been enough to secure our survival as a project gt gt unfortunately the faith in the market had not reappeared which resulted in a lot of selling of our tokens it is quite clear that there has been an effort to drive the price down with market manipulation using 1 2 oak transactions gt gt the lack of funding from the main ico sale in 2018 meant that there is no liquidity fund as described in the whitepaper this fund would have been able to stabilise the early market and to mitigate the risk to project founders when they put their projects onto the platform as such there has also been no budget for market making coin market cap have a policy of requiring 5k day in volume which with no market making has not been possible and so there are few new buyers to the token market gt gt these factors have combined to represent a significant risk to any founder putting their project onto the platform having their project wiped out we have looked at several ways of mitigating this risk but recent news from our main backer has now made even these last efforts irrelevant the syndicate that were largely responsible for our pre sale success in the meantime have broken up this means that there is now no control over several million tokens and no chance of mitigating the risk to founders on the platform without a significant liquidity fund which as described above we do not have gt gt the expectation that projects going onto the platform of which there are many would raise the token price and reduce the risk is no longer valid if a large token holder could just sell into the gaps and crash the price the founder could be wiped out and there is no way we could prevent this gt gt with respect to the founders we have been working with we hope the work we have done with you so far can at least stand you with a good chance of success as you continue your crowdfunding journey elsewhere gt gt to our community token holders and to our team many of whom have been with us since the beginning we re sorry this hasn t been what we all hoped it would be we ve all tried our best to make this work and with your support came very close to overcoming the many obstacles that have been thrown at us since march last year sadly this last one is insurmountable gt gt thank you for being such a great and supportive group without your support and work the project would have folded long before gt gt we hope the above explains why this difficult decision is being made gt gt ceo and cfo as co founders amp x200b 	0

in a recent episode of the 80000 hours podcast glen weyl made a number of critical remarks about the blockchain as a technical data structure claiming it was inimical to his way of thinking i find it strange a political economist of weyl s caliber and influence would think he has the expertise to condemn the blockchain from a technical standpoint not trying to dismiss his other remarks personally i do believe his concerns are mostly fair and on point at the present time but will ultimately turn out to be unfounded over the longer term due to the selective disclosures which will be made possible by widespread adoption of efficient zero knowledge protocols given weyl s prominence in ethereum land it may be a good idea to provide him with some technical clarifications or counter arguments anyone care to parse through his statements and offer their thoughts here s a slightly edited transcript of the relevant part of the interview gt robert wiblin what do you think are the biggest downsides of the crypto community i guess i only have a vague exposure to it and it seems to me that whatever group came up bitcoin are clearly geniuses and vitalik buterin creator of ethereum is otherworldly i think in his insightfulness but i guess it has also attracted a lot of over confidence in people and people who are drawn in by the ideology more than anything else and i guess at the worst end there s all sorts of scammers and bullshit artists who see there chance to make a quick buck do you see them as damaging the community or overall it s still a very good group gt gt glen weyl i would say the technology that s currently called blockchain which has a bunch of different elements to it is a dead end i think it has very few applications if any where that s going to be the right kind of data structure to use i also think it has very problematic social implications i think the ideology instantiated by the actual technical protocols right now is dark and deeply problematic there s a spectrum from a really intelligent person who has a good understanding of what s going on through deeply naive and somewhat like self deluding deliberately because of potential greed and so forth issues through to outright scammers if you ask where the center of gravity is in that it s definitely in that latter end of the spectrum so there are like huge problems however capitalism has enormous problems as i ve been trying to say and there s very little space in our society for seriously reconsidering that and for people to think boldly about these things i think this is offering a space for that and that s extremely important gt gt robert wiblin you re completely confounding my plan for this interview i thought you were going to explain how blockchain was going to be very useful and i was going to explain why i was skeptical about those applications ok talk to me about the technical side why do you think the blockchain is overrated or harmful overall gt gt glen weyl yeah so first of all the data structure instantiates a view of where data originates and how it should be stored that is pretty inimical to what s the right way of thinking about where data is and how it should be stored in particular i m a big fan of decentralization but the blockchain isn t really based on that concept it s really based on the notion that a large part of all data should be completely public and then a bunch of stuff should be utterly private and that is ultimately the anathema of the way i think about things i actually think everything has some sphere of intimacy where it should be shared and some other sphere of intimacy or of society into which its leaking would be problematic it s almost never the case that you d want things to be stored completely globally and on the other hand it s almost always the case that you don t want them to be overly cloistered so data structures that instantiate the appropriate level of decentralization and that actually store data in relationship to the community to which it pertains have to be a much closer to optimal way of thinking about data structures and so that s at the very core of it s conceived that s a fundamental problem with the blockchain gt gt robert wiblin can you cash that out in an example where the current approach would lead to things being too public and how it might be organized better gt gt glen weyl well i mean basically the blockchain says you are anonymous online and then everything you do online is like totally public and completely transparent but like think about your reputation your reputation isn t something you need to share with everybody and in every context but on the other hand it s incredibly important that you not be anonymous because if you re anonymous you re unaccountable so instead the appropriate thing to do like if i were to look into your rob and see if this is a guy i should do a podcast with like probably what i wouldn t want to do is go to some global repository where every action that you ve ever taken is either listed or completely detached from you instead i would go to some people i would get in confidence references about you you see what i m saying like that s that way human societies are and should work things should not be either global or utterly individualistic and private they should always be shared with some communities and not with other communities and the blockchain just doesn t have the affordances naturally to allow for that sort of a structure at a technical level amp x200b 	1

does anyone know if a utility exists to find a particular block with a certain string in the extra data field i suspect unless someone is reindexing blocks that it would be an iterative process where i would have to query each block since genesis looking for a match and return when it is found but before i go down that path i thought i d see if anyone had already done something similar 	1

hello reddit we recently put together an analysis piece on how 51 attacks can impact the crypto market here is a small excerpt from the article which we believe is allowing threats of these attacks to become more commonplace gt gt in order to remain decentralized cryptocurrencies using a proof of work system must not allow a single party to control the majority of total hashing power gt gt but as the global pool of hashing power grows more liquid cryptocurrencies need to pass another important test they must be able to resist an attack from the total rentable global hashing power for their specific algorithm otherwise arbitrageurs may find it financially attractive to rent hashing power in order to perform 51 attacks gt you can go read the entire article here i would love to hear any feedback you might have on the article 	1

context neutrino acquisition by coinbase and the balance between data privacy vs legitimate community information sharing has there been any thought towards building a decentralized blacklist or reporting function currently fiat bank accounts which engage in malicious scam behaviour are tracked in centralized databases at government financial institution association levels i wouldn t be surprised if interpol has a database like that but highly doubt it is used extensively is there a decentralized blacklist that has been built if not what would something like this look like attestation submit claim or accusation about a particular address validation confirmation or contestation of claim i see a bit of this functionality already existing in the comments section of different block explorers caveat i do see that most scammers will just generate a new address for each target but this would still be useful for local fiat exchange kyc or community investigation amp research efforts 	1

for a little while now i ve been probing different discords to organize a weekly call for researchers and developers to come together and swap notes i ve been involved in crypto for only 2 years now but i think it s easy to say that this current bear market is flooded with a lot of people working on stuff behind the scenes i used to be able to keep up with all of the key technology economic theory and politics but now the amount of research is sheerly overwhelming amp x200b i wanted to know if periodic voice calls were something of interest to anyone out there on the bleeding edge of the crypto sphere the idea is there are multiple voice channels for people that want to focus on different areas and with different levels of expertise of course everyone can google everything they need to know but that s simply not practical especially when trying to put all the emerging developments into context with each other the main areas are technology fintech game theory amp memetics politics amp x200b i m currently targeting friday the 22nd for the first call i ve put a discord together there are self assignable roles let me know if posting the link is appropriate 	1

there has been recent confusion over progpow and whether or not it is going to be implemented in a future ethereum hard fork here is my understanding of the situation as it stands i consider myself a liaison to the ethereum core developers and facilitate the ethereum core dev meetings that happen every other friday amp x200b back when we were deciding the issuance reduction at the end of 2018 progpow was brought up a lot some considered it a bargaining chip for miners to accept the issuance reduction some miners believe that it was agreed upon that we would put progpow in a hard fork in exchange for an issuance reduction in reality it was decided at the time that we would investigate progpow to the fullest extent that we could but made no promises of implementation here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time amp x200b in core devs meeting 52 january 4 2019 it was decided we would go ahead with progpow it was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with progpow and no one speaking up it s sort of like accepting a proposal by silence to be clear there were some core devs who were in favor of progpow and had been for a long time so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment we were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise we would go forward with it the exact quote from me is gt so not to get too much in the weeds it sounds like what we ve come to is that we are going to tentatively go ahead with progpow and by tentatively what we mean is we re going ahead with it unless there s a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature is anyone feeling like that s not the case or if there s different feelings okay great then we will be going forward with progpow from 1 24 59 in the video meeting 52 notes amp x200b in a later meeting 54 it was decided that 1 the community via the ethereum cat herders is forming a 3rd party audit 2 miners should start vote signaling using extradata field 3 the ethereum cat herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision see tweet there is also a video and notes for that meeting 54 located here amp x200b since then the ethereum cat herders have been working hard on finding the appropriate auditor and raising funds for the audit audits of this kind are expensive the cat herders will be releasing a full blog post early next week with more details including amp x200b in summary a decision was made to move forward with progpow but no timeline was given as to when it would be activated in a hard fork it may be activated in its own fork or with istanbul if an issue is found by the progpow audit we may not go forward with implementing and activating progpow the process to come to a consensus on progpow has been messy and not ideal i personally believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy due to the fact that there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed it is unfortunate and i think we can all work together to make our decision making processes better as we grow as a community 	0

hello this probably gets asked frequently but here goes anyway could someone eli5 to me what one needs to do to stake ethereum in the future i m aware of the 32eth number that s being tossed around but otherwise i m pretty clueless would one have to run a node or can the 32eth just be in a wallet also how much is the initial cost internet bandwith electricity for running a node assumingly not nearly as much as mining i ve seen an internet video of making a btc node with a raspberry pi awhile ago but don t remember much from it thanks 	1

one thing that has frustrated about the progpow discussion is just the pure apathy we re seeing from some leaders and devs on the topic if it goes through it may be because not enough cared enough to stop it if it fails it s because the few voices that do oppose overpowered the majority who mostly don t seem to care at all ask a dev about most other eips and most will take a stand one way or another because many of them impact their dapps ask a dev about eip 1057 and frequently you ll get a meh i ll go along with the consensus look i get it we ve finally gotten to a place where the defi ecosystem and other projects have matured and become pretty damn usable and we ve all seen a ton of potential finally come together into real projects in some really great ways over the past few months as long as that functionality is working and secure and with room to grow many of us simply don t care much about the underlying pow algorithm that drives us until pos progpow pro or con aside this saddens me i think it s a shame that so few people care about the distribution mechanism that we ll be pretty dependent on for probably another 2 years minimum beacon chain will take at least a year or 2 to mature ballpark minimum another 5 8 of total supply or so will probably come from 1 0 before we can genuinely start to move off of it and nobody gives a shit about how that happens who that supply goes to and why part of me is pro progpow simply because it seems to be our last hope at at least fucking trying to improve our distribution mechanism that we re still going to be dependent on for a couple of years if it fails to pass i m pretty sure it will be our last attempt ever barring any emergency and i acknowledge that realistically there probably won t be an emergency if it fails asic miners will most likely behave and not stir the pot causing us to question their dominance i still don t think that we should necessarily be ok with them dominating field though those with access to cheap production primarily those in china and insiders close to asic manufacturers will always have a leg up and i m surprised so many are okay with this type of industry being the main beneficiaries in core economic distribution i realize gpu mining is always going to be flawed as well but at least we can fucking attempt to be generalized with it i d rather give at least a small shot for a user with a couple of 1070s and cheap energy who actually cares about ethereum to mine blocks than let it become a exclusive to specialized fucking milking factories it s not that gpu farms aren t bad in their own way it s the order of magnitude difference asics can allow the manufacture to have over time and maybe i m wrong maybe the the risk is just too high and it s right thing is to just stick the path for the benefit of not shaking the boat and go with what s working we ve seen monero have successful asic resisting forks a couple of times without any significant security events occurring but that doesn t mean ours will work without incident but even if i m wrong at least i fucking care about it unlike some of you who won t even take a stand i m sorry for sounding harsh and likewise sorry for continuing to stir the pot on this issue which i m sure many of you are tired of hearing about i just find it genuinely sad that there is that much apathy for something that i personally believe is still pretty important some of the apathy is bear market driven i know but i also get the sense that dapp devs are complacent in functionality to the point that they don t give a shit about the vision anymore or worse they say they care about the vision while simultaneously ignoring the problems with the underlying tech they build on look my dapp has potential to open up financial opportunities to communities around the world oh the underlying protocol it s built on has fundamentally flawed distribution and will for at least another 2 years never mind that we don t care about that anymore it just feels like we ve lost something epilogue remember when the ethereum community actually cared about fair pow distribution and asic resistance pepperidge farm remembers ethereum yellow paper one plague of the bitcoin world is asics but now that they re common in ethereum and my dapp still works fine i m chill with them asic resistant hard fork discussion overview collection of pro cons from hudson mostly pro asic resistance in the comments but what i like about this one in general is the nice collection of people actually fucking caring one way or another can we care about it again please absurdly efficient asic announced people caring even only 6 months ago nobody cares now 	0

last year at devcon4 in prague aya miyaguchi executive director for the ethereum foundation shared the values and organizational philosophy of the ethereum foundation she told us the foundation had embraced a japanese business management practice known as kaizen improvement this refers to an industrial style production regime or process that seeks to continuously improve an organization s tools techniques and labor force by cutting down all work related functions to their bare essence it s basically a form of zen buddhism as applied to lean manufacturing this involves an aesthetics of spiritual purity which aims to create a kind of formal beauty out of a state of emptiness aya explained her understanding of this organizational philosophy in the following way gt in today s society we re programmed to value addition and society has trained us to believe more is better the bigger is better but this addition has a dark side more people comes at the cost of more resources more money comes at the cost of more human exploitation and more power comes at the cost of more human inequality when we add thoughtlessly we create embarrassments in the world this is why we have to increasingly think about this philosophy of subtraction this philosophy isn t really new to me in japan we have this expression beauty in subtraction and it s deeply rooted in zen buddhism it s similar to minimalism but not quite the same subtraction allows ideas tastes and strengths to exist in their purest form gt gt at the ethereum foundation we actually aim to grow small that doesn t mean we re not hiring but hiring should only be for what the foundation can do and we try to minimize our power wherever we can as much as possible because what we want to grow is the entire ecosystem not just the ethereum foundation so as the community grows and the industry grows we d like to be a tiny part of it i should begin by saying i have the utmost respect for japanese culture i m acquainted with the kyoto school and have learned a great deal from various buddhist traditions i don t wish to dismiss the wisdom of the east i commend aya for guiding the foundation in this direction and wish no insult upon her she strikes me as a wonderful strategic mind and a very effective coordinator with that said i have the distinct impression she has misinterpreted the spirit of this doctrine i d like to look at the dark side of her interpretation as i interpret it and offer a more balanced point of view my primary concern is that beauty in subtraction improperly implied will in fact lead to corruption in subjection the foundation shouldn t be ceding more and more of its publicly endorsed authority without first finding suitable publicly endorsed replacements which is close to impossible given the immature and chaotic state of the ecosystem it s critical to bare in mind that the public trust was vested in the foundation itself by cutting down their strategic leadership to its bare essence the foundation has in reality created a power vacuum which causes other interests to rush in to seize the reigns generally speaking the majority of these interests are unlikely to be committed to the public interest they won t be sharing the foundation s benevolent ideas or values or philosophy by permitting this void in the power structure to exist the foundation has invited a reckless struggle for control between the technical elite this kind of competition will lead to a scenario where the strongest players subject everyone else to their preferred regime the end result is that the line of succession will be broken and all legitimate power therewith will evaporate in the eyes of the global community one can just as easily behave thoughtlessly through subtraction as through addition in aiming for purity we also clear the path for impurity all things are inverted by their opposites and kaizen is not exempt from this philosophical fact with more people comes the ability to generate more resources with more money comes the ability to relieve more suffering with more power comes the ability to rectify more inequality a strong vision and sense of leadership is what safeguards the integrity of the ecosystem and keeps it in a healthy state as we all move forward to a far more publicly viable kind of decentralization i e with reasonable checks and balances to prevent abuses this is why we should recognize both ends of the spectrum each side has a critical role to play only through the measured balancing of both do we achieve things in their highest form the foundation shouldn t aim to be small in the near term in the long term perhaps but now is not that time instead the foundation should expand and contract organically to reach our collective purposes i would strongly advise them to assert their power which is actually a prism for our collective power to whatever extent is most reasonable and necessary to support the public good above all you make a profound error in creating a devocracy it s an existential risk of very great consequence to undermine the community and the ecosystem itself by undermining the very basis which grounds them both my concerns are shared by many others in this community and they shouldn t be dismissed just because a few people in strategic decision making positions have embraced a spirit of techno magical escapism ethico political denialism and cynical compromise i don t believe these stars fully grasp the implications of their ideology they re leading a great many of us astray and i fear no one will be left with the power to stop them 	1

we coin the term security economics to mean the system of economic incentives designed to guarantee the security required for a public chain to operate for example with pow proof of work honest miners are incentivized to contribute compute power for mining reward the higher aggregate hash rate of a network the more difficult it will be to perform a 51 attack we will introduce a new framework to analyze this relationship and study the limiting cases where the current security economic relationship might breakdown in a given period t the blockchain network will release n coins according to its predetermined mining schedule for example bitcoin currently reward 12 5 coins per block its mining difficulty is adaptively set so it produces 144 blocks per day with a very small margin of error whether total network hashpower is 50 exh s or 5 exh s total reward per day is always 1800 bitcoins only difference is that the expected reward per hash diminishes when total network hash increases but hashpower cost money 50 exh s will cost 10 times as much as 5 exh s assuming they re running on the same kind of hardware the economic equilibrium is arrived when reward per day rpd cost per day cpd we further breakdown cpd to its components sunk cost e g cost of the miner and operating cost per day ocpd we make the following postulates about the mining process and miner s behavior 1 when price of a coin goes up temporarily rpd gt cpd new hash power will be introduced as it will be profitable 2 when price of a coin goes down but rpd gt ocpd then nothing will happen 3 when price of a coin goes down so much that rpd lt ocpd some miners will stop mining total network hash will fall until rpd gt ocpd again 4 mining hardware have a useful life of approximately 2 years miners would only deploy new hardware if they can cover cost within 1 year of mining assuming the above behavior of miners in the equilibrium state the total hash power per second of a network is bounded above by the market value of expected reward per second to stage a 51 attack on the network the adversary will need to match all of the existing hashpower on the network the required investment is approximately equal to the market value of minable coins in 1 year take bitcoin for example a total of 52560 btc are released to miners a year which equate to about 189m assuming 3600 btc the total hashpower of the bitcoin network is about 42 exh s which equates to about 3 million antminer s9 s this is what it takes to stage a 51 attack the cost of staging such an attack is a good measure of how safe a network is would anyone do it perhaps not which is the ingenuity of satoshi nakamoto assume you did invest 189m and compromised the bitcoin network what returns will you get sure you double spend bitcoins but bitcoins will be worthless when people find out its security is being compromised the delicate game theoretic equilibrium which we shall call the nakamoto equilibrium is just as important as all the cryptographic wizardry in keeping a blockchain safe the nakamoto equilibrium design has a number of drawbacks although none of them were of interest for nakamoto to consider they do not apply to bitcoin 1 nakamoto equilibrium only guarantees the security of the public chain itself and not the smart contract tokens which runs on it 2 out of all the blockchains that use the same hash algorithm only the one with the most honest hashpower is safe we will focus the remainder of this paper elaborating point number 1 and leave 2 to another article the utility tokens created in the ico hype were predominately erc 20 contracts executed on the ethereum network despite of their huge speculative value these tokens do not have much intrinsic value right now they simply represent the access right to a particular utility which will be built if ever far into the future the aggregate market value of all erc 20 tokens have never exceeded that of ethereum hence the hashpower required to guarantee the safety of ethereum is automatically extended to the erc 20 tokens running on the network we now consider a scenario with securities tokens produced from sto s a security token represent a share of a securitized asset these could be company stocks bonds buildings infrastructure etc indeed everything in the world could be securitized and tokenized on a blockchain the fundamental difference between securities token and utility token is that securities token have an intrinsic value attached to it the intrinsic value of a securitized asset could be several times the market cap of the public chain it s running on for example as of feb 2019 ethereum have a market share of about 8 10 billion dollars about 7 million eth is minable a year before the constantinople fork the total value at current market price of 120 eth is about 840 million the total network hashpower is 140 th s a bitmain e3 miner has an advertised performance of 180 mh s so total network hashpower is equivalent to about 777777 e3 miners which would cost roughly 800 million though the exact cost could be quite volatile this is how much one would have to invest to stage a 51 attack on ethereum network if the network consists of only eth and utility tokens whose value would plummet if such an attack were to be successful nobody is incentivized to do so but imagine sometime in the future if the ethereum network has securities token contracts whose underlying asset worth a total of a trillion dollars then carrying out such an attack would seem quite profitable a new security economic model is clearly required for any public chain to run securities token the biggest problem with ethereum is that miners are not incentivized to contribute hashpower as a function of total market cap of tokens running on ethereum this is not a problem in the era of utility tokens when they are worth significantly less than the main ethereum network in the era of securities tokens however this will become a significant risk as securities tokens can easily worth several folds more than the public chain itself we need to figure out a new economic model where the public chain s

i know this is an ethereum subreddit but i think this is on topic as a decentralized browser discussion it doesnt use any blockchain but more of a bittorrent like way of sharing files has anyone else messed around with this compared to like status browser etc they are alot different anyways just wondering if anyone thinks this could be a competitor or if ethereum wallets such as meta mask could be integrated into this i think it could be very cool however i am also somewhat of a cynic and i dont think people actually want a decentralized web but just want crypto integrated into our pre existing infrastructure for many reasons one of the main ones would be there own monetary gain tldr beaker browser any thoughts 	1
there appears to be a leaked document in the works signed by 97 devs which could ignite our very first class struggle a veritable devs versus plebs scenario as u dcinvestor phrased it basically the enlightened hardworking devs are pulling together in defense of afri against the big bad social media troll army with their crazy false narratives let me give you a flavor of the language in this document they the contributors and workers behind the projects intend to grow awareness by educating the community and cleanse us of the kind of toxicity that they as a community should avoid apparently a trifling number of complaints were valid and respectful while the vast majority of plebs have been asserting afri s involvement in wild conspiracies issuing personal threats and have gone far beyond acceptable standards of debate apparently a nebulous sense of humanity and better systems takes precedence over free speech apparently the plebs are so crazy and destructive that it s the devs responsibility to protect each other they ask how they can move past this incident as humans and whether or not we realize how much this intimidates them apparently we re just a cruel mob who mass downvote them on reddit apparently they reject this mob mentality apparently poor old afri was just speaking his mind he didn t deserve to be drowned under a sea of hatred they say because of course our meaningless internet trolling is rooted in frustration or a sense of powerlessness well then the voices behind ethereum have spoken our campaign of hate must not prevail they will not accept nor look away but will stand up against it because at the end of the day it s all about preserving the mental and emotional health of fragile humans isn t it i don t know if i m being polemical or if i m just rephrasing things into more objective language but this seems to be quite literally what this document is saying i doubt it s fake because it really does sound like the kind of response we ve been hearing back from hudson maria and their friends on twitter i don t speak for anyone but myself when i say this but i m very disappointed that these individuals are here to manifest the mission and vision of ethereum their general grasp of the events over the past few days is comically disconnected from the actual facts and concerns raised by many thoughtful voices in this vast and largely non dev oriented community they re trivializing the discussion i m pained to say it but these devs look tone deaf and cowardly even worse they look like a sectarian mob in their own right one with a dangerous superiority complex to re iterate a comment i made earlier there are insidious in group out group biases forming in ethereum the ethereum community isn t just about the devs and their everyday relationships it dwarfs that and extends far and wide into a complex social movement encompassing an extremely diverse crowd of people it s quite disrespectful and irresponsible to reduce us to a mere mob or whatever on the internet you can t just pretend that everyone outside your filter bubble is somehow hostile or irrelevant at the end of the day we re all here to support ethereum in one way or another it would be wise not to draw too many sharp lines between us i d like to open this up to discussion and hear everyone s thoughts thank you 	0

 gt 1 given that experts have recommended paper ballots as the most secure form of voting and arguments that electronic voting is always a bad idea what evidence has lead you to support online voting as a secure election method gt gt ay right now it would not be a secure method i agree that paper ballots are currently the most secure and even during the transition you would want to have paper ballots as a backup i believe in the vision of online voting but would not rely upon it 100 until the tech is ready for primetime gt gt 2 blockchain technology seems to be key to your voting proposal and i ve seen my fair share of justified skepticism surrounding this concept to cast doubts around its effectiveness in solving this problem how could a blockchain be implemented in a way that could solve any concerns with electronic election fraud or interference gt gt ay the potential of blockchain is vast theoretically a public ledger could allow for us to be 100 secure that our votes are cast without fraud or interference the tech is not there yet for nation scale elections but it could be in time that is the goal gt gt 3 convenience of online voting seems to be a driving factor in your support of these changes but voting from anywhere with no physical trail seems to open massive opportunity for foreign interference in our elections which is a concern for many after 2016 how exactly would your mobile device voting be verified to only come from us citizens gt gt ay there would be a registration process analogous to what is currently done where one can verify one s citizenship and address we have public records of most voters and verifying citizenship would be straightforward with the proper safeguards in place it wouldn t be possible to have a foreign power interfere without our knowing about it if the tech is ready again it s something we need to move toward to achieve a more powerful flexible and genuine democracy gt gt 4 bonus question also about voting do you support alternatives to first past the post voting such as ranked choice voting instant runoff or single transferable vote among others which would fix many issues in our democracy like being stuck in a 2 party system a natural result of fptp voting how would you work to get superior alternative voting systems implemented around the nation gt gt ay i am for ranked choice voting our current first past the post system tends to help incumbents and discourage voters from wasting their vote even if a certain candidate is their true preference some have suggested that trump would not have won the republican nomination last time with a ranked choice system as other candidates could have built more support as the 2nd and 3rd choice of many others the process matters i would champion ranked choice voting as president it would improve our democracy amp x200b awesome to see some insights around future potential	2
there has been a lot of talk lately about how our community interacts with other projects in the space some have reduced people s legitimate concerns to simple narratives like the ethereum community has become maximalist and intolerant i reject this notion and i feel that this is an unfair maligning of a broad and diverse community what some may miss that there are many here who are in favor of multiple types of chains and approaches but just because they may not be in favor of the same chains that you are doesn t make them intolerant maximalists i own quite a bit of bitcoin for example i also own tokens from other projects but i am not in favor of chains like eos for many reasons does that make me an ethereum maximalist ethereum is more than a technology it s an economic and social revolution for many of us who believe in the value proposition of ethereum the origins and goals of other projects both stated and unstated are of paramount importance when evaluating them i realize that for others ethereum is more of a technology revolution i believe it is both and for some of us we find certain approaches in the open source blockchain space to be particularly objectionable e g combining lucrative token sales raising funds beyond what is needed for development benefiting a narrow group of stakeholders like vc s and hedge funds and combining those things with on chain governance for an l1 for the record those are the very reasons i rejected eos and perhaps even more importantly we also pay close attention to how your project leaders and team members interact with those in the ethereum community is it productive and does it engage teh whole community is it demeaning is it manipulative eos burned many bridges when they launched themselves as an ethereum killer other projects are now making similarly foolish mistakes possibly in more insidious ways i have a message for those projects from one small piece of that community it is not incumbent upon the ethereum community to just accept such alternative approaches be they technical fundraising governance engagement communication etc and be labeled as maximalists when we reject them or reject tacit endorsement of them by others it is incumbent upon those projects communities to properly articulate their value as well as any additional value they may create for ethereum that s how you gain the support of the ethereum community not forcing it down our throats and calling us intolerant when we question it i have long said that if i find a project which can decentralize the world better than ethereum i will sell all of my eth and support said project i look for that project regularly and so far despite all of the marketing narratives from competing or complementary projects i still haven t found it 	1

x200b at the beginning of the gods unchained game each player can choose the power of god each god has three routines and one ultimate power to choose from ultimate power is a single use ability with powerful effects amp x200b these abilities help the player to be more flexible when building the deck they also reduce the frustration of building decks specifically designed to counter the annoying decks of the meta and never really match it choosing power can increase the strategic depth of each deck amp x200b e g when playing a combination focused magic card you can choose to use a defensive strategy and divine power if you match the armor or if you want to play against a dead opponent you can turn to a more aggressive game style amp x200b in addition to your god s excellency there is also the potential to build a deck of games you can make a very slow and controlled armor not their typical aggressive style your opponent may choose the wrong power for the game and give you an advantage amp x200b void in gods unchained when a creature dies it moves to the void this includes labeled creatures and creatures that you discard the only exception is the creature that was destroyed amp x200b the soul of the destroyed creature will be destroyed and removed from the game this is an important consideration when faced with some decks using the advantage of creatures in the void cards like half life and gatekeeper allow creatures to come back from the void giving insightful players the ability to stop their opponent s plans amp x200b keywords amp x200b the effects of keywords are very specific and designed to promote attraction and strategy games amp x200b big escape mode amp x200b the battle royale mode in gods unchained is our limited format and the royal card

between players in any market genesis cards will only be created during the pre sale period and will not be available in the future amp x200b rareness amp x200b rarity is a rough measure of card scarcity and is inevitably recorded on the blockchain rarer cards are not necessarily more powerful but given their novelty they offer a unique game strategy amp x200b due to the transparency of the ethereum blockchain we can prove the accuracy and quantity of each card s circulation myth cards are the rarest with only one card per card we limit the creation of myths to four times a year two mysterious titans are hidden in the pre sale card package and one will be auctioned shortly after the release amp x200b limited edition amp x200b the genesis set has 380 cards genesis cards can only be cast by opening the package during the pre sale period after the pre sale the public market is the only destination for your creation of cards they will never be cast again amp x200b genesis cards can be used in ranking games big escape modes and world championships amp x200b the cool thing is that they can be used in any game built on the gods unchained token amp x200b presale amp x200b if you purchased a card pack during the pre sale period you will also be allowed to enter our beta version in advance this will give you some extra time to prepare for the world championships and give us

tickets and is finally available alternatively you can purchase 0 2eth or other players directly from us a cap of 20k tickets will be created amp x200b shiny card amp x200b each single card can also be a shadow card 5 a gold card 1 or a diamond card 0 2 these effects are only superficial but significantly affect scarcity amp x200b you can create a lower layer card with a combination of shadow gold and diamond cards five standard cards can be combined into one shadow card five shadows become a gold coin and five gold coins become a diamond amp x200b five the game faq amp x200b some answers to common questions about the game so that players can master the game better and faster amp x200b 1 general questions amp x200b what value does the blockchain bring to the game amp x200b a lot traditionally the items in the game are directly owned by the company that created the game when you buy items in the game such as your character s favorite skin you don t own it the game company licenses you by using blockchain technology we can change this so that players actually have the items they buy or earn in the game they can sell items for real money if they no longer want it they can use it from the game to use other games and the best game developers can t destroy the value or power under the item dlc forces players to buy but that s not all through the blockchain we can prove the history of individual assets imagine that in the final round of the world championships an incredible game came from an unanticipated card now imagine that the player auctions the card to a charity by digital signature because its trading history is in the blockchain any future owner can perform digital proofs anywhere including in the final round of the tournament as it was created amp x200b will there be a free version amp x200b yes there will be a set of non tradable cards that all players can use amp x200b when can i play this game amp x200b our beta will be released in q3 and the full game will be released q4 amp x200b what devices can gods unchained use amp x200b initially we only used it on laptops or desktops we plan to integrate with mobile devices tablets and vr in the future when technology is available amp x200b is this a browser based game amp x200b although our creative sales are entirely in the browser the game itself will be released as a desktop application amp x200b 2 about the card amp x200b how do i get a card amp x200b there are three main ways amp x200b free set everyone can play a game with a basic set of cards that cannot be used card pack you can purchase a card pack to unlock a limited edition card trading when the game starts you will be able to buy and sell cards with other players in the secondary market amp x200b what is a balance test amp x200b card games are hard to balance even the most talented team in the world with decades of experience will make mistakes from time to time in a centralized game this means that the card becomes boring in physics games this means that cards will be banned from use in the game while playing cards and forbidding playing cards are not good for anyone it is sometimes important to stay entertained and energized so when something inevitably passes our testing process we plan to capture it as our balance beta the balanced beta will be a new listing after a month during this time cards can be collected from the package but transactions cannot be made this will give us enough time to understand how the best platforms are running make any changes and then tap the switch that allows them to be swapped this way we can have a balanced game instead of punishing players who trade with expensive cards early on amp x200b why is the card not initially tradeable amp x200b cards that have recently been introduced to the game such as cards in the card package will be locked into the transaction during the balance test we will explain this in a later faq this lock up period helps us ensure that each card is well balanced before trading in the secondary market making it easy for players to understand that the cards they buy alone can no longer be leveled or weakened by us and their scarcity is fixed the lock in cycle also ensures that we will never compete directly with the secondary market achieving a healthy separation by minimizing the relationship between trusting players and us amp x200b 3 about the game amp x200b what is the gods unchained world championship amp x200b every year we hold a world championship for gods unchained in our first game we will sell for 100 000 plus 10 of the cards amp x200b how to enter amp x200b we will print up to 20 000 championship tickets one erc20 token for admission buy any legendary or shiny legendary package and you will receive a free ticket you can also buy a ticket from other players or buy it through us tickets are available on a first come first served basis and registration begins immediately amp x200b when will the world championships be held amp x200b we have not yet determined the exact date but we are planning the first quarter of 2019 amp x200b do you have other games amp x200b yes a lot we are studying something interesting in the near future we will make a statement on this amp x200b 4 about game trading amp x200b what is genesis sales amp x200b now we are holding a genesis sale players can buy the first card before the game is released these cards will only be produced during the sales period and will not end until the end of the game release or until we reach the 15 million sales limit amp x200b what do i need to participate in genesis sales amp x200b a laptop or desktop computer with chrome or firefox installed metamask a browser extension that acts as a digital wallet that allows you to interact with our games ether a form of digital payment that powers the gods amp x200b can i buy a card pack after the pre sale amp x200b yes but they will be different cards each season we release about 100 new cards that can be found in the bag once the season is over we remove the card for that season from the package which means that the only way you can get a special card from the past is to buy it from another player amp x200b amp x200b this game guide comes from godapp gods unchained tcg game guide godapp amp x200b processing img 15wac0zy79j21 	1

web3 does not currently return the bloom filter for each transaction when getting a block is there a reason for this we can use the bloom filter in a dapp to determine if a block contains transactions that might be of interest to a user but it s not possible to figure out exactly which transaction without checking each one individually including the transaction bloom filter in the transaction objects returned from web3 eth getblock would allow this filters are currently very unreliable for detecting contract events when using public ethereum infrastructure thanks 	1

 collectibles are a common use for non fungible tokens one early pioneer of non fungible tokens was cryptokitties a blockchain driven platform where players have the chance to collect and breed digital cats if you ve ever owned a cat you ll know that they are not easy to replace as their appearance and personality make them unique in this case cryptokitties replicated this concept in the crypto world with each cat s digital genetic material being stored on the blockchain they can be bought and sold using ethereum and some are rarer than others indeed as reported by cointelegraph sales hit 12 million last year with the most expensive cryptokitty reportedly going for 120 000 other games have promptly followed such as fantasy titles where fighters are collected for battles and in another apt development almost like we planned it major league baseball in the us is planning to launch a game where baseball cards can be exchanged on blockchain some more usecases can be fund here 	1

 this essay is an excerpt from cryptospring a series of behind the scenes stories about the state of the ethereum ecosystem from dapp founders security engineers data scientists and more every time the ethereum protocol improves more people enter the ecosystem the design goals for ethereum 2 0 are as meaningful for the protocol as for the community decentralization resilience security simplicity longevity as pegasys applied researcher ben edgington recently wrote about ethereum 2 0 no participants will be required to have big iron in order to be full participants of the system ben was talking about hardware but this vision is for the people behind the machines too anyone can participate in the ethereum ecosystem it doesn t matter what country or college or company or codebase you come from you can build dapps you can build deep down in the stack who are the core developers whoever wants to commit to ethereum look at the contributors on github and find out if you can commit you can build building on the ethereum blockchain is only getting easier and more secure anyone who s ready can get a world class devops experience through a suite like truffle metamask and infura make it easy to manage accounts and connect to ethereum without syncing a full node light clients are emerging every day more plugins and apis are available the ethstats api helps you monitor the health of your node or network mythx s security analysis api helps you verify your smart contract code these tools make us faster safer more confident builders the ethereum ecosystem is also striving toward simplicity which as developers and designers know is difficult to achieve gavin wood and andreas antonopoulos s mastering ethereum is a public good for the entire ecosystem it explains ethereum in the simplest terms possible while also doing justice to the wonder and complexity of the system consensys academy is not only bridging the ethereum knowledge gap but using ethereum to secure and streamline accreditation the kauri knowledge network is simplifying content hosting distribution and discovery for anyone creating or looking for technical documentation about ethereum in terms of ux austin griffith s burner wallets have made onboarding and transacting astoundingly simple for new users ground reports from the ethereum ecosystem during all this talk of crypto winter i believe we have already turned the corner into spring everyone wants to know what the signs are making blockchain predictions isn t all too different from making weather predictions the best practice is to forecast according to surface reports upwind this is what i know is happening on the ground in the ethereum ecosystem the dxdao is a next generation decentralized autonomous organization for community governance of software protocol gnosis is ceding full control of the dutchx trading protocol to the community via the dxdao martin ko ppelmann of gnosis predicts that the dxdao which is 100 community owned has the potential to become one of the largest organizations on the planet as outlandish as that sounds it is never a good idea to bet against martin digital publishers now have an open source option to archive their content in decentralized environments and deploy token based business models civil will soon be natively integrated into newspack wordpress s new publishing platform this is how quality online journalistic content becomes censorship resistant and financially sustainable crowdfunding is evolving gitcoin s recent experiments in clr donation matching are helping projects with many contributors get an exponentially larger match the backbone of ethereum 2 0 will soon be operating on testnet various teams that are building 2 0 beacon chains are planning to sync on a testnet in coming months ethereum 2 0 is a thoughtful and elegant system that will usher in scalability at layer one the base trust layer of ethereum even as many technologies come online to enable scalability in transactional throughput at layer two 2019 will be a breakthrough year for ethereum scalability it has already begun crypto winter was a phenomenon experienced mostly by those who pay attention to token prices rather than the exponential surge of development we saw in 2018 that continues unabated i am fortunate enough to spend my days with people who are close to the machine and they continue to enjoy the balmy weather for most buidlers ethereum public chain and application layer development has barely skipped a beat and while some in the public blockchain ecosystem were fretting about token prices enterprise blockchain development has done nothing but accelerate at consensys we expect to do at least five times more work on the enterprise side in 2019 as in 2018 4 tips for buidlers if i could tell buidlers a few things i would say commit to infrastructure because blockchain technology rapidly unlocked liquidity it is not likely to obey the usual hype cycles they will be compressed and there will be a series of them as we have already seen since 2009 commitment to infrastructure will help the ecosystem weather turbulence ahead and reach the real blockchain golden age explore future business models groups like ethmagicians business models ring are thinking hard about token use cases and the market economies of web 3 0 i agree with kevin owocki that utility tokens are just the tip of the iceberg prize decentralization as ethereum 2 0 shapes up and plasma goes to mainnet we will witness the emergence of a network of stateful networks the real measure of a blockchain is not just transactions per second but decentralized transactions per second and the cumulative decentralization of the network have fun ethereum was built by developers for developers and we are still somewhat in the hobbyist era for blockchain build what you want experiment think way outside the box don t do radio plays on television figure out what this new medium is really going to be all about build blockchain games play blockchain games games will be a great way for us to learn how blockchain based mechanism design and cryptoeconomics enable new approaches to system building these new approaches will usher in an era of pervasive gamification within the systems of our societal infrastructure going forward when exactly will all the technologies the core protocol the layer 2 solutions the token models the ux the public chain the permissioned chains combine and connect to hurl us beyond the blockchain turning point they already have entrepreneurs and technologists are pouring into the ecosystem to build out the decentralized world wide web web 3 0 once you ve seen the profound implications of blockchain you can t unsee it each new wave of the hype cycle will bring larger and larger cohorts of builders and users for these people there is no turning back amp x200b 	1

is a sensorship resistant filesystem like filecoin really a good idea if you take a look at the freenet sub most people are scared shitless to host a node just because of the amount of illegal content that s in the blob what s the difference between this and filecoin or other p2p distributed filesystems vitalik had a video a while ago can t find the link that showed efficiency vs feesability for blockchains at the lease efficient end you had people who needed things like privacy sensorship resistance and immutability basically criminals where on the more efficient end the platform would become feesabel for people who just benefit from these things i think this might be the same the above topic but unsure not trying to spread fud or anything it s just been on my mind for a while 	2

this proof of storage is based on a simple asymmetric signature function signature segment and a symmetric key one way function not a hash function rather one that produces a ciphertext with the same file size as the preimage the proof of storage is based on that every server stores a unique encrypted version of the file without access to symmetric key the file is encrypted with a symmetric key one way function the client can choose exactly how many copies of the file they want to store by paying for exactly n number of encrypted versions of the file only client has access to symmetric keys periodically for example each month the client publishes private keys that servers use to generate proof of storage signatures of the file they host the signature proof of storage uploaded to the smart contract decrypts the segment of the encrypted file that was used to generate signature new segment each month incentivizes server to store whole encrypted file and validates the proof of storage if proofofstorage signature segment the signature is also used to select the next segment a commit reveal scheme is used to prevent stealing of proof of storage signatures economic incentives the client deposits a payment to the smart contract the server also deposits a sum equal to the payment the server also commits signature segment with a private key they choose this prevents the client from claiming the reward only they and the server have knowledge to claim reward removes uncertainty the server uploads that private key together with their proof of storage and both are validated if verified payment is automatic 	1
dear ethereum enthusiasts amp x200b please share with anyone that you know that does ethereum this is the mother of all mother case right now this has been going on since 2015 follow the twitter account a78gnstnydfs so we can organize around it amp x200b i was in queens the other day and a business was advertising their online course i went and i talked to them and i realized that their network comes from bangladesh and they had no idea what is happening across the river they were versed in bangladesh regulations but not in the new york one i see the same thing with communities from africa latin america central asia i am sure that no matter where you are i am sure that you talk with friend in the bitcoin space in new york city that don t participate in the manhattan ethereum scene if that is the case and you know someone in new york city let them know to show up at the courthouse on march 29 2019 at 1pm we need the judges to see that the room is full of people concerned about the legal future of ethereum the message is to tell them to pause and thing about the case amp x200b the court room cannot be empty like what happened in florida in the espinoza case we need the court room full of people amp x200b this is the mother of all mother case right now this has been going on since 2015 the question at hand if to know whether i have the right to sue to the state of new york over the bitlicense regulations please share with anyone that you know that does ethereum if anyone think that it doesn t affect them think again amp x200b regards theo chino 	2
 full disclosure verity is a blockchain oracle there s been a lot of talk about blockchain oracles recently being able to increase the adoption of smart contracts and make them more applicable for real world scenarios there s already quite a lot of talk about various companies and how they are building oracle solutions for example chainlink witnet rhombus as well as projects that require an oracle eg for prediction markets like augur and gnosis we verity are also working on an oracle product although have taken a different approach using the wisdom of crowds focusing on the hard to get or unstructured data rather than data that is already available if you re interested in seeing how it works or helping us test it to earn some rewards you can join a test event here we think it s a really fascinating area and with a number of companies focusing on it hopefully we ll begin to see a range of solutions that will start to enable wider spread use of smart contracts any feedback or suggestions much appreciated ps below as a screenshot of a test event amp x200b processing img 7o4ts23qhvm21 amp x200b 	1

i m not really a casual when it comes to crypto so i can only assume how the average person would feel about this i initiated a transaction with 5 wei txfee average confirmation speed after submitting it the average increased and the estimated confirmation duration is almost 20 hours so i thought ok i just initiate a new payment with more for the fee 40 sec estimated conf that tx is in limbo because the other one is still stuck lower nonce so i thought i cancel the first which then should push the second one through nope nothing happens at all now ethereum cut me off of all my funds for an estimated 19 hours now imagine your bank tells you sorry man you got all this money in your bankaccount but that 5 transfer you initiated 6 hours ago is still not through can t help you mate i know this will get downvoted because it s not positive but seriously think about it how a normie would feel in this situation i m frustrated because i couldn t sell the pump i would be pissed if i had to pay something really important like groceries taxi or the bill after going out gotta have some fiat as back up always because you may have a tx stuck 	0
since we made our beta available to the public we ve received an eye opening feedback from the community we want to thank the whole community for that it s your feedback that keeps us moving toward our goal which is making eth the common medium of exchange in everyday shopping as a payment processor there are some differences between our users the first type is ethereum veterans who have been in the community for very long the 2nd type is the new adopters who use our system as their second point of interaction with ethereum after an exchange 1 the veterans have expressed to us that they dislike a custodial wallet and they want to pay online using the wallets they already use 2 our growing new adopters love the fact that they can put some eth in their wallet and shop online without using any browser plugins and enjoy buyer protection at this split road we want to do the right thing unlike many of the actors in crypto ecosystem we don t want to cater our system only to the needs of the new adopter of eth even if they are our growing userbase we want our system to be useful for the old veterans in ethereum community as well so we re working on making our system work for anyone who want to pay when they shop online using their own wallet we re doing that by making our payment plugin supports payments coming from any wallet instead of only supporting payment made through our custodial wallet this allows everyone to be able to pay for their purchases using their own wallet while our early users can still pay using our own wallet if you haven t checked our demo you can do that here you can check our website here if you have used our demo feel free to share your opinion here or here 	1

you would hope and expect a true leaders to step up in difficult times unfortunately instead of attempting to quell the fire mr hudson jameson a leader in the community is poring gasoline today in a tweet firestorm he is expressing that he is so angry and disappointed in the ethereum community and that community members were concerned about mr schoedon for the dumbest of reasons and calling concerned grass root members for trolls there is whole host of tweets from mr jameson attacking the community one i find particularly damaging is a gif of a man coming back from a 10 day internet break assumingly mr schoedon and the house is on fire and everyone is beating up on everyone else assumingly the ethereum community mr jameson is now using his twitter as an attack vector against the grass roots ethereum community i d say if anything considering the situation at this stage mr jameson s tweets may be worse and more inflammatory than mr schoedon s tweets i don t think mr jameson has handled this very well he is letting emotion getting the best of him and blaming the community for a situation that he had ample time to solve himself a long time ago 	2

i ve been around these parts for a long time i ve worked for two of the largest and most reputable companies in the cc space i even ran one of the largest subreddits relating to ethereum back when the reddit community wasn t total shit more often than not reddit vocally supports the exact opposite of what is a good idea so here is my proposal to the eth devs quit supporting reddit as a means of communication and serious discussion the vocal crowd does not represent anyone i know in the industry nor has it been proven to have the best interest of ethereum in mind i will do my part by continuing to ignore reddit in forming intelligent and researched positions if i somehow fail to do this by visiting some shit thread saying vlad is betraying the world and he should be exiled because blah blah my money i promise to sell some of my eth and buy a competing project additionally i will work to ensure every company i work for currently and in the future will invest time and effort in whichever projects listen least to anonymous crowd thought idiots 	1

 note sorry if this is not the right topic as i am quite new to reddit so don t hesitate to point me to the right place to ask as far as my research goes i found to ways to interact with an ethereum blockchain from an android app we have go ethereum which seems quite complete implementation of a light client but people report that it can take many minutes to sync with the blockchain kethereum which is a library currently it is not a full featured ethereum implementation but contains enough code to allow the r walleth app to work status which seems to offer to run web3js based dapps but the experience seems far from straighforward as a native app so status seems not really an option for native dapps going with geth would make the app slow to start which will be of course unacceptable for end users would going with kethereum be enough secure and enough to interact with custom smart contracts amp x200b 	0
i have a very good understanding of how btc transactions are structured i have a light level of understanding on how eth transactions work can anyone explain how erc20 transactions work i can see that each erc20 token has a an eth address to it are erc20 tokens just eth transactions to the erc20 token address with a bit of metadata sprinkled on top is there a dev manual that would explain how to craft a erc20 transaction by hand in general terms or do most just pull the mew source and try to backsolve the magic 	2

in some ways it feels like crypto is right on the precipice of mainstream adoption just look at how many people got in on it so quickly in 2017 it literally blew up people are aware of it i feel like the technology might actually be catching up to the hype too with the tech now allowing near instantaneous payments at nearly 0 cost improvements are being made daily to accessibility too the new samsung phone supports crypto out of the box now so what do we need out of crypto right now to push it over the edge these guys seem convinced it needs to become legal tender i don t really know that i agree it seems like we could potentially leap frog over government entities entirely in the process it s never been done before but i can see it happening any other thoughts 	2

centralization occurs when a minority have sufficient power to act against or at least without regards to the will of the majority leadership is not the same as centralization leadership is what people voluntarily follow to places they wouldn t ordinarily go by themselves real leadership is not anointed or appointed it is voluntarily conferred upon individuals who stand forth and whom people voluntarily follow sure we can get this wrong we can create a position of unbalanced power and give it the label leader and then let this position determine the direction of the community regardless of what the majority desires but this is no more leadership than painting a pig black and white and calling it a cow makes it a cow it s just applying the wrong label what a distributed decentralized community demands of its leadership are people who understand leadership and demonstrate leadership when they cease to be heading in the direction that people will follow they cease to be leaders of the community it s an emergent position not a position of appointment indeed if we make the mistake of putting the badge leader on an individual we fail to recognize the importance of the position as one that must be continuously earned so let s not be looking to appoint leaders let s look to see who the leaders deserve to be and follow them but only for as long as they truly lead where we are willing to go 	1

how open source collaboration is building eth2 0 brief the importance of collaboration and communication amongst different projects in ethereum and other networks while building eth2 0 amp x200b 42 speaker james waugh axia labs topic token restructuring liquid token design governance amp incentives vs trade offs brief token design has shifted vastly since the first tokens launched on top of etheruem maker augur digix into fluffy payment tokens that provide very little true utility looking into the future a number of these projects are deploying different methods to change remove and rebuild these tokens into new and more equitable models amp x200b 43 speaker shashank tiwari cryptin amp gluon plasma topic scalable account based systems on ethereum brief plasma is soon becoming the

decentralised platforms built on ethereum usually tried to replicate the functionality of centralised systems directly often with poor trade offs we are now seeing solutions that take advantage of decentralisation just as we had to evolve solutions to legacy problems for the web and for mobile we need to rethink how to solve legacy finance problems that leverage the unique properties of decentralisation looking at solutions like uniswap vs order book based dex s may provide a path forward amp x200b 47 speaker zak cole whiteblock topic eth2 0 networking brief zak will be running a

i usually hold back any complaints about ethereum leadership because of the potential political fallout however i m posting this anyway because i m concerned that the core inner circle might be beginning to devolve into what bitcoin core is today the potential conflict of interest is an issue in its own right however the response to those concerns is a larger issue the criticism of afri s provocative tweet in the last week has been met with little to no response and now afri has gone dark by wiping his twitter account and posting i will no longer respond on gitter skype discord slack wire twitter and reddit regardless of whether the initial concerns had merit the response to them is irresponsible especially considering a huge fork is less than two weeks away the decision of the parity release manager to wipe his twitter account and go dark 11 days before the constantinople fork is a bad one it s a bad look for parity and it s a bad look for ethereum the voices of the community shouldn t be ignored we are the miners who support the network we are the developers who give ethereum its usefulness we are the businesses who bring commerce to the public blockchain and we are the investors who contributed money and time to make ethereum possible without the community ethereum is nothing this isn t a one off event it resembles the earlier eip 999 mess for those that don t remember eip 999 was another proposal to unfreeze the parity multisig bug wallets afri s unexpected pull request to change the eip s state to accepted over a technicality despite heated disagreement was widely criticised by the community similarly it was never met with any public comment and i m not aware of any response to date except perhaps in private i believe the ethereum leadership team should be held accountable to the community and i don t think this is a big ask ethereum is a multi billion dollar project to change the world and it should be treated as such i m looking forward to healthy disagreements and discussion final notes 1 parity has done a great deal of good for ethereum i m sure neither afri or parity are bad actors i m an active user of parity currently running eight full nodes 2 it would be fantastic if more people followed bob summerwill in his approach to absolute transparency especially if they re involved in two possibly competing initiatives i have always admired this approach 3 as with any team working on promoting decentralization and or free trade i wish polkadot success 4 i have a financial and ideological interest in ethereum succeeding 	0

 this bot automates making markets on binance where other market making bots fail ie bitmex deribit other attempts i ve made in the past is by counting on the market to not be volatile where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself where on bitmex and deribit these spreads ar 0 25 of a btc some smaller markets on binance have 1 2 5 spreads and greater than average volumes you ll want to have about 20 per market pair it s looking to trade in the base asset btc bnb eth etc it will look to trade more markets if the targetspread targetvoldiv targetvolmult are higher the more total funds in a particular base asset there are the higher value the orders will have if for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of considered pairs it will continue selling that asset with the same sell logic on the quoteasset bnb market while pausing buying it i don t have enough personal funds available to run the bot but i can get a good amount of income if i share it and people use my ref link targetordersizemult exists so that people can compete using the same bot on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot constantly as you can set a of your order size to ignore when there s a bid or ask better than yours when the volume that beats your price is higher than the order size this multiplier it ll re enter the market note that you should never trust your api keys to a bot without proper code review nefarious people out there will use your balance to manipulate the price of very low liquid markets and pick up a huge amount of cheap tokens from your hard earned crypto at the current time binance rate limits are 1200 requests per minute 10 orders per second 100 000 orders per 24hrs there are no limits for unfilled orders and at most it ll make about 6x 20 or so pairs x 2 orders 1 cancel and 1 re port a minute along with checking balance and getting order books so a total of about 500 a minute not close to 1200 on that note i ve only been trading one pair averaging 42 orders an hour or 1000 per day again by about 20 pairs would be 20 000 orders per day a bit shy of 100k amp x200b 	1

hey everybody looking for a few answers on ethereum pos i m familiar with the difference between pow and pos but what i m not sure about is a aside from owning 32 eth or pooling my 3 6 12 eth how would i participate in the pos process and generate income from it b it is my understanding that those who chose to stake their eth will be given a weighted vote to validate new transactions and if they vote to validate a transaction that is found invalid they lose their staked eth if this is the case how much technical expertise would be needed to vote i apologize if my questions general understanding of this concept is rudimentary if i m missing anything else please lmk thanks fam 	1

i d like to present my simple minded analysis and critique of a recent article by kent barton titled scaling civility how to preserve ethereum s most crucial strength i m doing this not to offend or insult but because i believe it showcases a pathological sentiment among a radical subset of developers and points to a deeper socio systemic issue the article begins with a rather deceptive platitude to get everyone on the same page gt throughout most of its existence ethereum has been a place where crypto adventurers of all stripes can explore build debate and learn within the confines of a friendly respectful and non judgemental community i called it deceptive because it appears to be a safe space fantasy born from someone with a conference going sense of identity kent is the founder of ethereum denver he has a rather peculiar interpersonal perspective of a certain part of the ethereum developer community in denver and one might assume on github and other similar online dev circles and yes perhaps his view of the community is more expansive than that but i strongly doubt it for all the reasons i ll elaborate in this response for one thing someone with a genuine sense of the scope of the ethereum community would understand it s a diverse global movement embracing various subcultures with their own distinct ideologies and preferences to be a member of the ethereum community isn t to abandon your own cultural identity there s no reason to think someone s membership in the community is contingent on being a developer or being a person who is uncritically friendly respectful and non judgmental and frankly it should go without saying that one shouldn t have to be if some part of the community has an issue with another person or company it s their natural civil right to express it whenever and wherever they please shaming silencing or ostracizing them by labeling them as a non dev or as unfriendly disrespectful or judgmental is most definitely counter productive to the kind of culture i understand the ethereum community to be aspiring kent is most certainly speaking about a highly narrow subset of the development community when he talks about the fertile ground for innovation and salubrious climate which he reduces quite casually and without thought to things like the relatively massive number of active developers on github and at conferences hackathons or once again the proliferation of projects and emergence of entirely new proto industries this is kent s rather distorted context from the community from this twisted lens it s clear to see why kent can t grok the events of the past few weeks with regard to the afri debacle conflict of interest debate ryan zurrer issue and ensuing moderation discussion he speaks of these events as ugly and a very different picture comparing it to his own awesome and enjoyable atmosphere perhaps kent wasn t here for the dao fork debate which was far worse by practically all standards anyway bewildered by these differences kent wondered about the cause and what he and presumably other developers can do about it he cites the status survey on ethereum values gid 840981558 to articulate his explanation kent claims one of the key takeaways from this survey was a strong sense that reddit is no longer a place for positive and constructive discussion he then tries to summarize this supposed sentiment by cherry picking an anonymous responder who said gt the online community is beset by trolls who i feel manage to have an outsized impact on the community we need tools that can represent stakeholders better than whoever posts most frequently on reddit this is a very misleading statement for at least 3 important reasons 1 the majority of respondents who bothered to fill out the survey were members of the development community 2 the survey only covered about 200 people not at all a representative sample and 3 contrary to what kent says the survey is very much undecided about reddit there is a total of 26 instances of the keyword reddit in the survey after parsing these results for sentiment i found 9 negative 8 positive and 9 neutral ambiguous in the negative set there were a few common sense concerns about trolls 1 person complained about a toxic reaction on reddit over the parity fund recovery issue 2 people had something bad to say about the reddit user deviatefish they gave him as an example of a bad community member 1 person felt unhappy about the original community losing their sense of group identity to the newcomers 1 person claimed the threads were manipulated with the very last person taylor monahan as it turns out gracing us with the following in response to the question is there anything in the community that exhausts or tires you gt going on reddit literally i m a fucking reddit moderator and opening reddit exhausts me these days it s so sad it used to invigorate me to talk and connect with random people but these days theres so much hate and not hate as in questioning projects or questioning why something is or isn t a certain way but just straight hate and ulterior motives this is a disturbing statement coming from a community moderator in my opinion but regardless i wouldn t call these negative remarks indicative of the belief that reddit was no longer a place for positive and constructive discussion it s my observation rather that discussion simply dissipated when the dev community decided to jump onto twitter where they can just isolate themselves in their little safe space cocoons that plus the split into the ethereum magicians forum is what stifled community discourse on reddit if i m not mistaken the community here has very little blame to shoulder moving on to the positive set i found 3 people who cited reddit as one of the communities related to ethereum 1 person had something good to say about the reddit user dcinvester 1 person had something good to say about the reddit user deviatefish 1 person talked about how it was nice to put faces to reddit profiles 1 person offered participation on reddit as an example of what a good community member would do and 1 final person said one of their happiest memories was on reddit i d like to mark out for special attention the person who offered deviatefish as a good community member or role model here s the reason they gave for choosing this person gt his tendency to dissent from the majority opinion using logical arguments is beneficial to avoiding groupthink in our community groupthink is indeed the right word to describe what many people have observed recently i think contrary to the dev s posturing regarding the so called toxic reddit mob mentality it s actually the devs who have fallen prey to this mentality in their escape into the twitterverse insider hopping conference circuit magisterial council of the magicians and other privileged zones the devs have forgotten all about the unsung forces who made ethereum a global phenomenon many devs indeed have forgotten who this infrastructure was meant to serve it s very likely many of these devs just cashed in on the crypto bubble and had a nice laugh building their start ups or whatever it was they thought they were doing by breaking people s trust and taking the public for granted many of these devs have simply assumed we would have their back but it need not be that way if we all decide it to be otherwise it s time you recognize the extent of your self serving insulation and mean spirited aversion toward the very people who make up the lifeblood of this ecosystem never assume ethereum is so glorious and self sufficient that it can t be reduced to a momentary craze a nowhere cult with no real destination never assume you re a protected class with a higher calling or status than the rest of us continuing my analysis or is it a critique at this point the article doesn t aspire to a cohesive global community identity it actually praises the opposite a proliferation of communication mediums and fracturing of all discourse kent seems to think everyone gets a bubble of their choosing twitter for some folks magicians and ethresear ch for others or why not just keep all the meaningful discussion in back channels or private rooms where the big bad mob can t hear you that seems to be where this line of thinking is going i believe the social vacuum kent speaks about is actually populated by more than mere newcomers people who are simply in it for the money and rancid trolls my goodness kent don t you realize the community is larger than your imaginary technocratic bubble of crypto nobles many of us know exactly what s going on and we don t care to be your serfs in the new kingdom you re building don t pretend to speak for us at this point i d like to simply solve the puzzle and offer this rather unsurprising possibility kent whether consciously or unconsciously wishes to disempower and marginalize the community voice because he s 1 good friends with people at parity or the web3 foundation 2 biased about parity s multisig fund recovery efforts and or 3 invested in the polkadot network in some manner before you go off saying that s his choice understand that i know it s his choice it s perfectly fine if he s diversified but then he shouldn t be pretending to speak about what s best for the ethereum community and rallying the troops against people who have no interest whatsoever in supporting the parity trifecta of doom you see it s also my choice to view this as a threat and have good reason to view it as a threat and then also alert people to the best of my ability that it is in fact a threat my hopes and dreams and fears and those of countless others can t just be wished away just because kent is a reputable figure in the community and i m not or because there might be rampant infidelity in this ecosystem and people need to cover their asses by shutting everyone up please assess the content of what s said and the larger context in which it is being communicated rather than the person saying it allow me to elaborate a bit more on twitter kent introduced his article with this statement gt occasional community drama is inevitable a steady decline into maximalism personal attacks trolling and dogmatism is not sound familiar this is the confused anti maximalist parity narrative i mentioned in another thread thankfully a user by the name of crn caught on to this disturbing statement and questioned kent further to find out what he meant by the strong hints of tribalism and maximalism arguing you give no support for this as a root cause if you provided some we could argue them without any there s nothing to rebut remember hitchens s razor that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence in response to this kent said gt i was thinking specifically about the parity bad parity evil knee jerk reaction by some that led to the afri situation we might reasonably assume all other negative sentiment regarding parity past and present is also presupposed by this remark and in the article itself he says gt newcomers who are less informed have no idea about the context and history regarding something like parity and their plans and are easily swayed by vocal noisy shrill opinions are we starting to see the pattern here the plebs just don t get the grande design you feel me we re uninformed bag holding idiots according to this fellow followed by this gt anything that feeds that narrative you can t sync a full node sharding will never work polkadot will replace ethereum my emphasis again he s trying to gaslight us as if there s no competition to speak of and then this gt most relevant for our current problem are the zero sum fallacy polkadot s gains are ethereum s losses and the echo chamber created by shrill trolls on reddit again my emphasis more condescension and gaslighting and why not throw this one in too because we re being so friendly respectful and non judgmental right kent gt we should remind people not to conflate the assholes who post on r ethereum with the broader ethereum community i don t think my blood is the only thing boiling when remarks like this get flung about so carelessly by such a high ranking and trusted figure it boils all the more when i think about how this kind of sentiment has likely already taken root in the mind s of other impressionable devs in the community there s so much venom in this man s words you d be forgiven for thinking you were engaging with one of the fabled reddit trolls he hates so much seriously please do read the entire article this man is absolutely livid his polite discourse conceals nothing if you can t smell something is rotten with this parity polkdaot web3 drama you re really not paying attention there are many conflicted devs working in this space right now who seem completely oblivious to the perverse incentives to which they re exposed and are actively trying to create this silly narrative about how the ignorant masses just don t get how cool life will be with polkadot and company running the show we re all just newcomers get rich quick nutters and idiot trolls with no context remember only the crypto nobles understand the master plan you see the plan that was supposed to make them a fucking fortune so you better fall in line and drink the polkadot kool aid honestly i ve been in this space way longer than most of these self righteous devs and i can say without a doubt there s some trippy brainwashing propaganda going on here it s like invasion of the blockchain body snatchers out there don t say i didn t warn you 	2

12 24 word seeds paper key are used to back up and secure a variety of wallets lots of apps ledger trezor have multiple cryptocurrency types secured with a single seed phrase are these seeds transferable into any other wallet of the particular currency individually so if on my ledger i have ethereum can i use my 24 word ledger private seed phrase in a coinbase ios ethereum wallet the reason i ask is i have successfully used the same 12 word seed phrase on cipher app ios metamask chrome and coinbase wallet ios but there is clearly a difference between the 12 and 24 words i haven t seen a space for 24 words of a ledger wallet do all ethereum app wallets have universally transferable 12 word seeds thanks	1

let s say i have a collection of media i want to preserve my ideal system would have as many of these attributes as possible censorship resistance uploaded files should be as difficult or cost prohibitive to remove from the backend as possible file removal should be unfeasible for bad actors hackers ddos attackers and dapp developers it should not be trivial for governments and should withstand lawyers or legal letters as there should be no centralized point for them to attack internet frontends there should be a simple mechanism to download these files from a normal browser like google chrome if frontend a censors the content it should still be available from frontends b c and d rolling out your own frontend should be trivial think something like the pirate bay upload permanence once a file uploads it should stay uploaded for as long as possible there should be no expiration at the least there should be a reasonable expectation the file will remain on the backend for 5 years or more hash based searches if you know the hash of a file you should be able to use that hash to find and download the file through one of the frontends large file sizes you should be able to upload files around 10 gb in size if there is a cost associated with this then the lower the better upload it and forget it after i upload it i shouldn t need to remain online for other people to download it what most meets these criteria right now is there anything coming down the pipeline that meets more of these criteria i already have some ideas but i m looking for suggestion from someone with more experience with ethereum than i have 	2
i m a random guy who has managed to accumulate enough eth to be a validator assuming vitalik is right 32eth this bag is a substantial share of my net worth my question is does anybody actually recommend that i and people like me make the effort to become a validator i would need to buy the hardware and learn everything i would need to know to set up a node i don t foresee myself being able to learn enough to confidently start staking with my own validator as much as i read about crypto stuff a lot i still don t fully understand blockchain technology enough to confidently talk about it and answer any skepticism in the tech let alone have enough knowledge of the mechanics and code behind staking to give myself confidence in setting up a validator i could instead join a staking pool but then i m giving custody of my eth to somebody else and doesn t that defeat the whole point of staking i feel like for me to have enough confidence to become a validator would require studying the tech full time in a classroom environment being taught by an expert 	1
good day all amp x200b i do currently own some eth i have stored in my ethereum wallet but i am looking to top up a few more haven t bought in over a year now and am wondering the best place to purchase some what are your top 2 3 sites amp x200b thanks in advance gankan	2
i stumbled upon a podcast with andreas antanopoulos where at a certain moment he talks about eth and the speculative value it has been given by the market i forgot at what timestamp so i have to listen to it all over again but i put the link of the podcast below as far as i understand he says that for the ethereum network to work properly the price of eth must only reflect the demand for people using it to pay for uncensorable computation essentially what he was saying is that if you hold eth with the intention of selling it at a higher price you are negatively effecting the network so if the cost of gas eth is a fortune because people use eth the fuel it as a store of value it makes it harder and harder to for many dapp projects to operate this would mean ethereum is doomed to fail which i don t believe so probably i missed something can someone please eli5 	1

the online mode of payment has enabled people across the world to pay and transfer funds easily without the barrier of any geographical restriction within a digital transaction consumers merely have to confirm the purchase and the payment is processed in no time however there are some critical pitfalls that keep people from harnessing optimum benefits out of electronic means of payment transfer essential setbacks associated with fiat currency transfers instability in value of fund with passing years the value of fiat money tends to depreciate leading to inflation pressure because of higher import prices and increased export demands it generates a critical issue for businesses with small capital and restricts them to be a part of the global market lack of exposure to banking system even in this era of globalisation merely 41 of the global population own bank accounts more than half of the world population still cannot transact or trade beyond their physical boundaries lack of security fiat money transactions are always vulnerable to online fraud as the same card debit or credit can be used by anyone to make payment without adequate authorisation additionally to complete an online transaction users have to submit their personal information thereby increasing the chances of identity theft 	1

 this post was written and approved by the following moderators in alphabetical order heliumcraft insomniasexx nickjohnson rzurrer souptacular twigwam not everyone was able to weigh in at the time of posting and individual mods may weigh in with their personal views in the comments of this post purpose the goal of this post is to communicate why the recent thread calling for the removal of rzurrer was removed by moderators and open a discussion about what we want this subreddit to be moving forward and what moderators should be and do why remove the thread a number of the moderators who were online at the time of the removal agreed that the post was in violation of one of our most important subreddit rules gt no inappropriate behavior this includes but is not limited to personal attacks threats of violence gossip slurs of any kind posting people s private information while not all comments were in violation the collective nature of the thead including the title of the original post and tone of subsequent conversation was focused largely on attacking a single person rather than having a healthy debate regarding the subject at hand for this reason those around at the time agreed collectively to remove the post upon further discussion and as more moderators came online it became apparent that not all moderators were in agreement about the decision we have been discussing internally what actions moderators should take shouldn t take and how we reach consensus especially when those decisions are subjective and in regards to polarizing posts will we remove any of the current moderators not at this time right now we remove moderators when and if they are a not upholding their duty as a moderator we are all very sensitive to the potential for moderators to act as censors for this reason our role as a moderator is primarily to prevent spam or scams approve valid posts that were caught by the automoderator take action on posts that violate our rules internally discuss posts that fall into a gray area before taking action we typically have a discussion internally on posts or comments that require subjective decision making or fall into a gray area in terms of the rules this includes things like personal attack posts is progpow mining discussion or technical discussion etc we rely on one another to ensure a single person s views aren t controlling what is seen or not seen in the subreddit none of the mods have moderated a post regarding themselves furthermore his moderation actions especially in the past week have been to approve valuable posts that were improperly removed by the automoderator moving forward we want to open a discussion here on what moderators should be what actions moderators should take and how they should make those decisions with this information we will make a decision on what moderators will remain which will leave and potentially who would be good people to add to the moderation team this will also guide moderations decisions moving forward and give us all community member and moderators a more tangible understanding of the role of moderators in r ethereum we hope to add a transparent post summarizing this information which can be helpful for community members current moderators and to onboard new moderators what we hope this subreddit is as the community grows the attitudes goals and views of community members become more diverse this is a huge positive but comes with some growing pains while having disagreements and differing viewpoints is valuable and makes the ecosystem more robust the way those disagreements are communicated and discussed can lead to toxicity and tribalism rather than the aforementioned robustness we will not tolerate personal attacks or witch hunts we support healthy discussion regarding the role of moderators we do not discourage the questioning of what we do or don t do or why we do it we encourage conversations regarding ethereum s role in the larger ecosystem and how ethereum and the community continue to grow and evolve we would especially encourage conversations that have a wider impact on ethereum and the community for example discussing conflict of interests how it s handled in the traditional world how you think it should be handled in this decentralized ecosystem are all incredibly valuable accusing someone of having a conflict of interest and calling for their head is not we do not expect nor desire a community that is in perfect agreement all the time a healthy community should be diverse containing a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds and world views we do not aim to limit or remove discussions that debate polarizing topics we should be encouraging discourse controversial debates and talking about problems openly we do hope that this community will continue to be welcoming inclusive diverse and respectful of one another especially during times of disagreement open for discussion we would like the discussion on this post to revolve around the aforementioned topics we are especially interested in hearing what you hope this subreddit is what types of content and discussions should be encouraged and how we all can encourage those types of conversations we would also like to discuss what role moderators should play in this community how should posts like the aforementioned post be handled what makes someone a good moderator we are looking forward to having a healthy open discussion here that will lead to a more positive environment for the progression of ethereum and a more transparent process for moderators of this subreddit thank you 	2

first off i d like to say that i appreciate the work of the developers and researchers in ethereum it s specifically because i want to support them that i am forced to ask these difficult questions from the leadership of ethereum the facts seem to be as follows please correct me if i m mistaken polkadot has a different technical implementation but will be competing for the same market share as ethereum s beacon chain sharding implementation polkadot via parity was given 5mm by the ef afri who works on parity polkadot and ethereum makes a snide tweet about eth s roadmap future being futile because of polkadot s superior launch timeline and he is the one in charge of ethereum s launch timeline and has called for delays in the face of significant resistance in the recent past in response the community receives full silence from all of the explicit leadership of ethereum and from afri himself in the place of a strategic direction vision response to this bomb we get an ama from ethereum s santa where no one asks any tough questions because they know it s not his job to answer them they smile and thanks him for being awesome which he is and it s all ok wat all of this is in the wake of a fairly recent change to the development schedule and timeline whereby we find out we are still 2 years away from a full implementation of pos and sharding assuming they get it right the first time i swallowed my tongue in the wake of this in good faith but i can t or won t keep quiet until the elephants in the room are addressed is afri still working on eth why is the beacon chain vision timeline still a viable option if polkadot will be live a full year earlier why have all of the implicit leadership of ethereum been so quiet up until now if the ethereum foundation doesn t provide a structure for guidance damage control in situations like this what exactly is it s function what is the harm in making this implicit leadership more explicit or are we reinventing that too 	2
