hi guys a lot of people used to reffer to the volume to put in evidence the last step of a bubble burst the capitulation however it s seems that volume is not the only indicators of that phenomenon i have decided to show you the bitcoin volatility index in the white box of btc 60 days you can cleary see in the 2014 crash the two peak of the volatility index the first is from the 2014 ath and the second is from the capitulation later in 2015 if we look at this index during the last bubble we can also see a strong peak in the volatility index during the big fomo when btc has reached 20k then the next big volatility peak was during the crash from 6k to 3k now volatility index is very low i think it s pretty normal that the volatily in 2014 was able to reach such height because the market was still very very light in term of capitalisation years later in 2018 market was slightly bigger and the volatility is harder to reach such level from this analysis i could conclude that the pattern is pretty similar and makes me think that we may have reached a bottom it s just my point of view maybe we will see in the coming month one more dip with volume but i m not so sure what do you guys think of my analysis hope my english is not so bad not my first language sorry weekly btc price in log scale and btc 60 days volatility index from 2013 to 2019 	1

 sorry this is the second time i post this still a noob at reddit hi i would like to share a personal experience i had with my bank today i was expecting since december a payment income from a company i usually work with they are a very reliable client and normally i do not have any problems to get my invoices payed i was waiting for a payment from december january and february and it didn t arrive to my bank account i called the company several times and they where telling me that the payment was done but they had to look into it with the financial department so i waited i was busy the last month and was not really checking my account very often but when i did i got really upset today i called them very pissed of telling them that they have to pay me i was really annoyed about the situation i got the guy on the phone who deals with my invoices finally and he told me that he has a report that the payment was done on time and that my bank rejected the incoming money wtf so i called my bank and they said that it is true they rejected all incoming money because they needed some paperwork tax related i asked them why they freeze my account without being notified and they answer that they did by post letter which by the way i never received no mention on the online banking either this was really embarrassing calling back the client company a needed to apologize that they did nothing wrong and that my bank decided by themselves that no money goes into my account this client is a really good one and i accused them not paying me on time these days you have to treat good clients properly and because of my bank now i needed to apologize to a good customer with btc this could not happen hope one day everyone use it 	0

 reaching the masses blockchains rollercoaster journey amp x200b img y8mtq86qf1j21 amp x200b a 40 million dollar pizza amp x200b on november 1st 2008 nakamoto published a paper titled bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system just two months later on january 3rd 2009 he or she or a group of shes and hes began mining the first block of the chain known as the genesis block the 6 day process was rewarded with 50btc valued at nearly 1 000 000usd during bitcoin s 2017 climax not bad for a week of work since then the world has marked ten years mining often accompanied with the thrill of major gains and subsequent fist clenching losses amp x200b more than a year and a half later on may 22nd 2010 a programmer named laszlo hanyecz was able to strike a deal trading 10 000btc for 25 worth of papa johns hence dubbed bitcoin pizza day the day is not only significant because it marks probably the only time someone has ever spent tens of millions of dollars on a single dinner albeit with a few leftovers but it also marks the first real world commercial transaction powered by bitcoin amp x200b bitcoin is a fad amp x200b so far the industry has faced its ups and downs every climax has been accompanied by technological breakthroughs and innovation in algorithms each ebb has been characterised by the lack of practical use cases bad press or regulation troubles amp x200b key points on this rollercoaster include blockchain being ignored misunderstood outright taboo strictly controlled and finally accepted imitated and flourishing where we currently lie on the journey isn t known but what is known however is that blockchain missionaries will keep pushing the word of decentralization amp x200b at first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they attack you and finally you win gandhi amp x200b amp x200b img hum3bmdqf1j21 where in the technology are we now amp x200b so far there have been two concrete eras of blockchain dial up and fibre optic flip phone and that computer in your pocket make any comparison you want advances have been plenty amp x200b blockchain era 1 0 bitcoin amp x200b the first generation of blockchain is represented by bitcoin it s currently the most well known blockchain in existence even if someone doesn t know what a blockchain is odds are they ve heard of bitcoin however the mechanism that powers bitcoin and makes the transfer of value possible doesn t get as much attention bitcoin depends on a proof of work consensus algorithm to verify blocks and mine coins it is currently only used to transfer value from peer to peer and cannot support other uses when you hear about someone pushing blockchain for business or personal uses this isn t the one amp x200b blockchain era 2 0 ethereum amp x200b the second generation of blockchain is represented by the advances made by ethereum from this point on the uses of blockchain have been diversified greatly ethereum provided smart contracts and the evm which showed that applications could be linked to the blockchain the ico and rise of erc20 tokens is thought to have pushed the price of btc to an all time high of nearly 20 000usd but still we re not where we need to be if blockchain is going to be a practical tool for everyone amp x200b however due to the increased amount of ico s taking place in 2017 currency bubbles and overall attention garnered the blockchain space caught the eye of many governments supervision of icos and various powerful regulations where put in place to control the finances going in advances started to cool attention waned off and before we knew it the crypto winter was upon us amp x200b markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected george soros amp x200b blockchain era 3 0 thank you next amp x200b we find ourselves increasing tps speeds into the tens of thousands and higher focusing on ecological community governance ending centralisation and bettering the economic model for incubating various decentralised apps amp x200b multiple consensus mechanisms and technical architectures have emerged such as proof of stake and delegated proof of stake iota uses dag directed acyclic graph architecture neo and ruibo adopt byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms and more however breaking through the speed bottleneck while also remaining decentralized remains an issue amp x200b 2018 gave us many firsts in the public chain sphere all competing for the next round of bull market leaders but the issues have not been solved amp x200b at the beginning of 2018 about forty or fifty public chain projects were launched most concentrating on dag architecture of sharding segmentation technology there projects were highly anticipated by investors but at present nothing has come out of them which has exacerbated the current disappointment that is the crypto winter chains still suffer from centralization slow speeds and no sustainable vision the race to get to the top has left many breathing thin air with no supplies to set up camp nothing to build a future on nothing to build communities amp x200b amp x200b img dav0smdqf1j21 bitconch bringing the warmth of spring to the harsh crypto winter amp x200b bitconch has offered a solution to the issues still plaguing the blockchain world the approach uses the proof of reputation por consensus algorithm in which a quantified reputation bit r is created using three dimensions user socialization currency holding time and computing power contribution amp x200b the parallel processing architecture know as blaze bitconch ledger access zero delay extension and a random selection of 30 to 500 verifying nodes pushes tps to more than 100 000 a hundred times faster than competitors amp x200b based on the nature of the chain it serves as an efficient platform for combating centralization increasing speeds and allowing all upstanding members of the community to play an equal part not just those who have all of the resources as seen in previous chains amp x200b through solving the problems holding blockchain back bitconch is able to provide decentralised applications with a more practical and conscientious solution amp x200b bitconch proof of reputation amp blaze bringing an end to the crypto winter 	2

as most of you probably know ledger nano s while providing some very decent security lacks several important features in its ledgerlive app namely ability to to use your own full node for syncing up the transactions ability to view utxos and control which ones get spent like you can in electrum to name a few many users are now aware that they can actually setup an electrum based wallet while still using ledger for transaction signing however not many realize they can actually migrate their existing bitcoin wallets that they see on ledgerlive app to electrum it requires a few jumps through the hoops but is rewarding in the end my set up was as follows i had a legacy bitcoin and a segwit enabled wallet i was able to migrate them both to electrum so i could control any subsequent tx s with ledger from electrum i was also able to import all existing transactions and thus have fine grained control over transactions this last step involved setting up electrum personal server if there is enough interest in this process i will put together a guide and post a link let me know in the comments if there is enough interest 	1

 this brings up the question of what a good price for bitcoin would be when will bitcoin stabilize it should become less volatile as it becomes more widely adopted because it will be harder for local events and individual people to affect the price very much right not necessarily although perhaps we will see less wild daily swings i think bitcoin is unlikely to ever attain anything like a stable price if bitcoin s price were stable this would mean that it had achieved an equilibrium with the other currencies there would have to be some sweet spot at which there is exactly the right balance of bitcoins and dollars when bitcoin s price went a little bit too high people would start to sell for dollars and when it went a little bit too low people would buy more bitcoins to anyone who thinks this is possible i ask why would any equilibrium happen what would it possibly mean for bitcoin s price to be too high unlike just about anything else a higher price for bitcoin does not reduce its usefulness one bit one simply trades in smaller amounts of it in fact a higher price makes bitcoin more useful because a higher price indicates that more people want to buy which means that bitcoin s liquidity grows which makes it more useful as a currency therefore i would suggest that we should never expect an equilibrium between bitcoins and dollars or any other currencies instead bitcoin should show a pattern of hypermonetization it will become more and more valuable at a faster and faster rate priced in terms of other currencies its price chart should show an asymptotic increase that approaches infinity after a finite time bitcoin may stabilize in terms of real goods but i see no reason to think that it will stabilize in terms of other currencies once bitcoin starts killing the other currencies it will still be volatile and this will still be an indication of its success if my prediction is wrong and bitcoin ever stops being volatile that might be a good time to dump it source 	2

so this is a story with multiple incidents the reason i tell it is to warn other users and the fact that their funds might not be safe any longer 1 internal hack my email was changed from within okex and no id was asked no mail from support no nothing that field has no change button on it so if possible it had to be done with special request okex could not provide any email or evidence that proved they received such a request 12 btc were transferred off after many mails in which they tried to convince me i changed it although it is not freaggin possible they gave me back 90 of lost funds as i was talking with walls i decided to take what they offered 2 enabling 2fa on accounts without it by force after being internally hacked and not admitting it they changed their internal policy and blocked all accounts that did not have 2fa leaving users with open trades and no access to accounts this happened to me i had a stupid long position open that was heading towards liquidation i sent an email asking them to remove the 2fa urgently so i can manage my position on 14 dec they sent the request further and asked me for we need to confirm it you want to remove 2fa from okcoin account right if yes we can remove 2fa for you please send those information surname last name given name first and middle names former name s alias if application date of birth nationality name in local language passport number current living address information offline level 2 documents required 1 international passport photo 2 address proof document id or driver s license or bank statement or utility bill with your current living address which is issued within 3 months in english after that please finish video verification by skype may your account or withdrawal will be frozen according to the safety rule amp x200b so after enabling my accounts 2fa they wanted level 2 verification as well i complied and sent them all the data in the hope that i can get access to my account to manage my position no no on they have the audacity to actually make me wait another 72 hours for something i did not do with the risk of me losing my position i was outraged thanks for your understanding and cooperation during the process for security concerns we need to freeze the account first for 72 hours please provide this code 6996ed after 72 hours we will remove the ga at that time for withdrawal we will enable it after you finish level 2 verification online amp x200b account was restored after 72 hours with all my level 2 verification deleted which i had to redo no prior announcement or anything to let me know this was going to happen amp x200b 3 tried deleting my account yeah right amp x200b so i decided to leave and asked them to delete my account that is not possible apparently you can only freeze it so they have your entire history and personal information which you have no say over but this is not the worst if you can believe it or not sent them an email from a different address of mine that had nothing to do with the account and asked them to delete it a few hours later it was suspended no questions asked as of who is this new email then i noticed and asked them to unfreeze the account so i can change some information in it that is bogus if they can t delete the account i received this answer the lie 16 hours later still blocked and they again have the audacity to ask for a skype call and all that other bs they refused to answer me why they blocked my account from a different mail then the one registered they sent me a personal mail to my registered address hoping i won t noticed they changed it because they effed up after getting a support specialist on the line that was ready to explain to me how come i was able to block my account from a bogus email but not unblock it they cut the chat to the whole site amp x200b i m not making this stuff up but believe me i wish i would i spent many years on okex even before it was independent and the level of lies and unprofessionality i witnessed here is at another level maybe i m alone in this in which case i constantly just get unlucky or it s been happening for a while but again ppl will ignore it until it s to late amp x200b cheers guys happy trading d	1

don t get me wrong i think this is great to get the word out and get btc more mainstream but has anyone thought about how kyc aml laws have bastardized the process you put a buck into the coinstar machine and get a voucher you then take that to coinme s website and claim your crypto by wait for it entering in your name phone number and email address into this startup companies website what john doe trying out btc on a whim at wal mart as he walks by the kiosk is going to be cool with that i was actually going to run out at lunchtime and use it just to post a pic on my social media until i saw the kyc collection step and that s coming from a guy who s already a bitcoiner i hope i m wrong but an experience like this is just going to further solidify the masses association between crypto and scammy dangerous scary i don t know the process but if they put in 20 before finding out exactly how the voucher system works and the info that they will have to provide they will be pissed i just want to reiterate that this is not the fault of coinstar nor coinme and i commend them both on stepping up and sticking their neck out for btc adoption i just wish the legacy system laws would stop shooting us in the foot at every gd turn 	2

 amp x200b introduction the global village created by the internet has restored the original sense of distance in the face of the huge obstacles of cross border payment nowadays with the rapid development of economic globalization the economic ties between the countries of the world are closer global trade is constantly taking place and there are more and more scenarios for cross border payment however due to the large number of intermediate links involved in traditional cross border payment high handling fees and poor timeliness of collection and payment which causes inconvenience to cross border merchants in cross border payment traditional cross border payments are slow and expensive traditional cross border remittances are mainly rely on remittance companies post offices banks and some offshore fund in international trade cross border payment faces with both expensive and slow problems each fee does not seem to be high but it has not been a small number in the long run the traditional cross border payment settlement method is exemplified by the world s leading express remittance company western union even though it has the largest and most advanced electronic exchange financial network in the world the fastest time to pay for cross border payments is 2 to 3 days if you use ordinary bank wire transfer it takes 3 7 days to wait and the cost of each transaction is 30 to 40 dollars while technological advances such as the internet have changed most communications and business models these cumbersome processes have hampered economic growth and created additional costs for large administrative and compliance departments the trend of globalization is irreversible what new technologies will empower cross border payments in the future globalization is irreversible atox supports for cross border payments although in the short term sino us trade war british brexit and other isolationism phenomena emerged the globalization trend of cross border trade is irreversible because the internet and new technologies have connected the global market the demand for cross border trade export e commerce or cross border payments is increasing the market is looking for safe efficient and low cost cross border payment methods so the blockchain known as the fourth technological revolution can produce explosive chemical reactions with cross border payments in this era of blockchain the answer is yes the application prospects of blockchain technology applying in the financial field especially cross border payment are widely optimistic at the tuyere of such a great age atox was born atox builds a common decentralized trading system based on blockchain technology providing users with real time payment and settlement services in cross border and any currency worldwide cross border payment will become extremely convenient and low cost to enhance the cross border remittance service experience while promoting value transfer and settlement efficiency atox aims to be the first brand of cross border settlement to contribute to the global settlement industry to create a vertical ecological chain and an open ecosystem to achieve the interconnection and sharing linkage of the whole industry from the view of time atox s lightning payment initiates a transaction and complete it in 3 seconds eliminating too many operations and cumbersome process so that you can easily pay at any time and anywhere it s inevitable that blockchain technology has brought about a convenient reform of cross border payment and settlement as a new star in the field of public blockchain atox relies on the characteristics of blockchain technology to provide efficient payment and settlement services and other related services for merchants and consumers around the world so that trading methods have a better trust mechanism making lower transaction costs and more smaller resistant choose the atox project to let you break out in 2019 participation link amp x200b 	1

few days ago i found an old post from ryan castellucci about decoding this qr code probably the qr code that posted ryan has not enough information to be decoded but i decided to give it a try just for fun i know the address has 0 balance i did never decode any qr code by hand and i few days ago i didn t even know how the information in qr code is decoded after reading the internet and watching videos on youtube i learn a few things about qr codes but the information posted there are not accurate i believe first thing to mention here is the error correction and mask information bits some websites say that the ec and mask needs to be xor ed by 10101 some other like wikipedia says nothing about that so the first question here is what mask do have the qr code below is it 111 no xor or 010 with xor the second question is about mask patterns these are also not the same on internet for example wikipedia says that the mask 111 has pattern j 3 but other sites tell it is i j 3 i j 2 so what mask pattern has the image below i also tried to debug the zbarimg library to see if i can extract some usefull information about the scanned qr code and came to the place in code where it says that data encoding in this qr code is byte encoding 8 bits per character but after demasking this qr code with different patterns it just does not fit also it would be nice it there was some tool that coule tell all the information about qr code for example what mask pattern it uses and all other meta information is there somewhere such a tool 	1

 the economic effects of inflation what has government done to our money by rothbard to gauge the economic effects of inflation let us see what happens when a group of counterfeiters set about their work suppose the economy has a supply of 10 000 gold ounces and counterfeiters so cunning that they cannot be detected pump in 2 000 ounces more what will be the consequences first there will be a clear gain to the counterfeiters they take the newly created money and use it to buy goods and services the new money works its way step by step throughout the economic system as the new money spreads it bids prices up as we have seen new money can only dilute the effectiveness of each dollar but this dilution takes time and is therefore uneven in the meantime some people gain and other people lose in short the counterfeiters and their local retailers have found their incomes increased before any rise in the prices of the things they buy but on the other hand people in remote areas of the economy who have not yet received the new money find their buying prices rising before their incomes retailers at the other end of the country for example will suffer losses the first receivers of the new money gain most and at the expense of the latest receivers inflation then confers no general social benefit instead it redistributes the wealth in favor of the firstcomers and at the expense of the laggards in the race and inflation is in effect a race to see who can get the new money earliest the latecomers the ones stuck with the loss are often called the fixed income groups ministers teachers people on salaries lag notoriously behind other groups in acquiring the new money particular sufferers will be those depending on fixed money contracts contracts made in the days before the inflationary rise in prices life insurance beneficiaries and annuitants retired persons living off pensions landlords with long term leases bondholders and other creditors those holding cash all will bear the brunt of the inflation they will be the ones who are taxed inflation has other disastrous effects it distorts that keystone of our economy business calculation since prices do not all change uniformly and at the same speed it becomes very difficult for business to separate the lasting from the transitional and gauge truly the demands of consumers or the cost of their operations for example accounting practice enters the cost of an asset at the amount the business has paid for it but if inflation intervenes the cost of replacing the asset on the books as a result business accounting will seriously overstate their profits during inflation and may even consume capital while presumably increasing their investments similarly stockholders and real estate holders will acquire capital gains during an inflation that are not really gains at all but they may spend part of these gains without realizing that they are thereby consuming their original capital by creating illusory profits and distorting economic calculation inflation will suspend the free market s penalizing of inefficient and rewarding of efficient firms almost all firms will seemingly prosper the general atmosphere of a sellers market will lead to a decline in the quality of goods and of service to consumers since consumers often resist price increases less when they occur in the form of downgrading of quality the quality of work will decline in an inflation for a more subtle reason people become enamored of get rich quick schemes seemingly within their grasp in an era of ever rising prices and often scorn sober effort inflation also penalizes thrift and encourages debt for any sum of money loaned will be repaid in dollars of lower purchasing power than when originally received the incentive then is to borrow and repay later rather than save and lend inflation therefore lowers the general standard of living in the very course of creating a tinsel atmosphere of prosperity fortunately inflation cannot go on forever for eventually people wake up to this form of taxation they wake up to the continual shrinkage in the purchasing power of their dollar at first when prices rise people say well this is abnormal the product of some emergency i will postpone my purchases and wait until prices go back down this is the common attitude during the first phase of an inflation this notion moderates the price rise itself and conceals the inflation further since the demand for money is thereby increased but as inflation proceeds people begin to realize that prices are going up perpetually as a result of perpetual inflation now people will say i will buy now though prices are high because if i wait prices will go up still further as a result the demand for money now falls and prices go up more proportionately than the increase in the money supply at this point the government is often called upon to relieve the money shortage caused by the accelerated price rise and it inflates even faster soon the country reaches the stage of the crack up boom when people say i must buy anything now anything to get rid of money which depreciates on my hands the supply of money skyrockets the demand plummets and prices rise astronomically production falls sharply as people spend more and more of their time finding ways to get rid of their money the monetary system has in effect broken down completely and the economy reverts to other moneys if they are attainable other metal foreign currencies if this is a one country inflation or even a return to barter conditions the monetary system has broken down under the impact of inflation this condition of hyper inflation is familiar historically in the assignats of the french revolution the continentals of the american revolution and especially the german crisis of 1923 and the chinese and other currencies after world war ii a final indictment of inflation is that whenever the newly issued money is first used as loans to business inflation causes the dread business cycle this silent but deadly process undetected for generations works as follows new money is issued by the banking system under the aegis of government and loaned to business to businessmen the new funds seem to be genuine investments but these funds do not like free market investments arise from voluntary savings the new money is invested by businessmen in various projects and paid out to workers and other factors as higher wages and prices as the new money filters down to the whole economy the people tend to re establish their old voluntary consumption saving proportions in short if people wish to save and invest about 20 percent of their incomes and consume the rest new bank money loaned to business at first makes the saving proportion look higher when the new money seeps down to the public it re establishes its old 20 80 proportion and many investments are now revealed to be wasteful liquidation of the wasteful investments of the inflationary boom constitutes the depression phase of the business cycle 	1

if we look at bitcoin pre 2017 it was seldom known outside of some communities now 2017 was the first time you started seeing hearing people talk about bitcoin so i would consider this the time it was on the public s radar even though it wasn t really respected right off the bat people starting realizing the massive potential btc and crypto in general had my take is that most of the people with big money started to realize the crazy potential that this space was presenting but the price had already ballooned because the public was buying it up even though they had no clue what they were buying so the big money people wanted a piece of this new tech but didn t want to jump right in not knowing when the bubble would pop also they didn t want the bubble to continue while they were on the sideline so why not pop the bubble this is where i think the futures came into play this made an easy opportunity for big money to short btc and kind of help push the bubble to pop they could essentially force pressure on the price to go down and all it takes is a little bit when you have a ton of people owning an asset that they don t understand they will panic to get out at the slightest sign things are going downhill then you start the chain reaction once the first wave sells it triggers the next and so on now that the price looks to have bottomed or is at least near it the cboe decides they don t need futures anymore because public interest isn t good enough is it really because the public interest is down or is it because they popped the bubble and have positioned themselves now for the future 	1

 first of all i m sorry for the possible mistakes english is not my native and this is my first article out here the total computational power in the bitcoin network reached the indicators of the beginning of november last year which is the maximum level for these past four months so according to cryptocointraders on tuesday march 19 this figure was more than 52 eh s amp x200b all experts have repeatedly reminded earlier that price of bitcoin follows the hashrate and the growth of this indicator states that optimism is on the market in particular among miners it is also worth noting that the current level of hashrate is more than four times higher than the figures that could be observed in december 2017 when the price of bitcoin rose to a historical maximum of around 20 000 so i d better consider opening long over the short position happy trading 	0

i have got a question concerning ln transactions many anti ln people like ver and co always say that it s impossible to route big transactions through the ln because there is virtually no route that could forward a payment of let s say 100 000 as an example i think most of us agree that payments that big should be settled on chain anyways even if fees might go into double digits again in terms but let s just do a thought experiment here node 1 has wants to route 100 000 to node 6 node 1 has a channel with node 2 with a capacity of 100 000 node 2 has a channel with node 3 with a capacity of 70 node 3 has a channel with node 4 with a capacity of 40 node 4 has a channel with node 5 with a capacity of 60 node 5 has a channel with node 6 with a capacity of 50 if i understand ln correctly node 1 can send a transaction to node 6 with a maximum throughput of 40 because the channel between node 3 and node 4 limits the size of the transaction to 40 couldn t we just go ahead and split the 100 000 payment into 2 500 payments 40 then assuming we pay 1 satoshi per hop and btc price is 4 000 that would be total fee of 2 500 4 4 000 100 000 000 0 40 which is not that much imo the wallet app could just go ahead find the route with the biggest throughput potential and divide the transaction by that amount everything under the hood the only thing the user might notice is that the payment would cost a little bit more in fees than a normal ln transaction which is perfectly fine considering that the payment is huge and it s still dealt within the speed of light if there are flaws in my logic or if i misunderstood of ln works please feel free to correct me thanks in advance 	1

i m developing a slot machine game with 5 slots each slot has 6 options pear lemon etc each spin 5 random values get generated one for each slot making the slots spin to the option bound to their random number when 3 or more consecutive numbers get generated in a spin eg 12444 or 42223 or 11111 the player wins the spin the won amount should be calculated depending on the number of consecutive equal numbers in a won spin the amount the player bet that spin and the value of the consecutive numbers 1 should be worth less than 6 see included image below for an example win chart in short the question would be how can i calculate the multiplier for each option eg 25 5 in the image which would result in a 45 chance of making a profit on the machine if you do the calculation and create a chart with the multipliers needed for me and show how you ve done it i ll send you 200 000sat 	1
 the single greatest reason why the us fiat dollar is the greatest currency on the planet is because it is backed by guns it is backed by lots of gun the us dollar is backed by the strongest military in the world most effective battle hardened army largest most powerful navy that opens the world s water ways for free trade to benefit all the world and has the strongest air force like it or not it s true you might think that the computing power of bitcoin as a support for value but it is not they are known as miners miners only maintain bitcoin blockchain and that is it once the price of bitcoin falls again miners will shut down and reallocate their capital towards crypto with real value amp x200b because bitcoin has no value it makes bitcoin s perceived price based off of speculation basically what the next guy is willing to pay for it if that next guy doesn t want to buy because they realize that it has zero value then the price drops we all understand that it meets the college text book definitions of money but like all college freshman who worships che guevara and fidel castro and the bolivarian socialist utopia you soon grow up and realize that it is all fud the concept of bitcoin reads well and in a text book and could operate as a functioning currency in a utopian society but once you begin to understand that the only thing propping up the value is the next fool that is willing to pay for it then the bottom begins to falls out people will point to other things like gold and say that it is driven by perceived value while this is true however with gold people can actually hold it in their hands and wear it as jewelry ect because bitcoin is only driven by speculation and had no value you better sell bitcoin now because once intelligent money moves away from bitcoin only fools will be left holding fud smart money will move towards crypto projects that have real value for example enigma the value of enigma is basically the value of information like facebook google and all the other tech companies their business model is based off of having information and selling it enigma will be the medium of exchange for information and the network will house and process data if you are looking to invest in the next project like google who will revolutionize the world then invest in enigma now before the price passes bitcoin amp x200b i am not your financial advisor and write this as my personal opinion in full disclosure i recently bought enigma because this project is a winner and to show how serious i am about investing in this project i actually barrowed money on a credit card through binance to purchase enigma some might say i am a degenerate speculating on this project and i will rebuttal with that i have meticulously studied the crypto market and this project far exceeds all others and will change the world in the next couple of years amp x200b at the time of writing this article the price of enigma is 43 so if you like this article feel free to throw some crypto this way my erc 20 wallet address is 0x0b8396cbd9199d47216a703eb861af632fc9ad46	2

i do not seek to create confrontations or meaningless discussions but i am interested in the opinion of people who have been in the community for a long time and are well informed because i sincerely find it hard to think that el btc could reach such a figure someday since many did not think that it could never reach 100 and reached or 1000k let alone 20k and finally arrived but for it to reach 1 million taking into account the maximum supply only bitcoin would have to have a marketcap of 21 billion in order to reach that price in some countries they talk about trillions but at least in spain i am sure that 21 000 000 000 000 000 is 21 billion it seems to me that an enormous and ridiculous amount of money would have to come in to get to that point what do you think 	0

i ve been kicking this idea around for a while and would like to get your feedback before investing any money i think that in addition to promoting adoption through word of mouth and things like bumper stickers i think a conversation starter that doesn t directly interfere with generally accepted professional dress codes could be the way to grass root this thing into the mainstream i got this idea because in my place of work we only accept cash about 2 years ago i would occasionally add or bitcoin half joking when a guest would ask how they could pay most laugh some ask what s bitcoin some say really to which i say yeah i ll take bitcoin realizing that if they actually did give me say 100 in bitcoin i would simply throw a 100 bill from my pocket into the register and call it a day this got me thinking that there must be thousands of us that could say deliver the check to a table we re serving in a casual cafe someone notices the wristband and says can i pay with bitcoin and you say sure they scan your qr code you walk over to the register and either pay with your own debit card or cash and bam we re one step closer to world domination or it just starts conversations that make bitcoin a little less fringe and a little more acceptable as for the design i was thinking something like this or or maybe parody the original livestrong bracelet with printing bitcoin the exact same way because the colors are so close i don t know i m 42 and i d wear it it also seems like the perfect product to sell on a lighning enabled website due to it s low cost thoughts is this opening up anyone wearing to a mugging or is this the best idea i ve had all day 	1

i drove my friend to pick up a vehicle he was going to buy for a few thousand we got to the sellers property at around 7pm my friend thought he could either use paypal or bank transfer easily and that would be that good god no there were two people at the property with a paypal account my friend tried to send the money to both accounts first they thought my friend could just send the money to an email nope then the sellers were bumbling around trying to remember their passwords to their accounts and when they finally did they realize that they weren t verified they both go through the process to verify at the end they realize they have to wait a few days to be accepted pfft my friend tries to transfer through the mobile banking app denied my friend then calls his bank to transfer the money the bank tell him he has to transfer the money after midnight and couldn t do so now wtf my friend then has to log in to internet banking on the sellers laptop adds the seller as a payee and then finally sends the amount but wait it doesn t instantly transact because it s a large sum it transfers the next day luckily the seller wasn t too bothered and just took a picture of the confirmation of transaction and handed the vehicle over if it was any other guy our journey would have been a waste madness spent 45 minutes trying to send a few thousand to a private seller granted my friend could have just withdrawn the money earlier in the day but he leads a busy life and didn t have time today s shit is too damn inconvenient 	2

with the focus over the past few years on price partnerships institutional investment regulation etc it is important to remember that these are different goals and pursuits than what satoshi was attempting the original vision was one of operating outside of the system away from corrupt institutions governmental and private and away from fiat hint to stable coins the focus on adoption and institutional involvement isn t necessarily bad and sometimes it s impossible to avoid almost everything operates through fiat blockchain tech is useful for businesses adoption is a good thing and blockchain may help many sectors of our current systems but none of this was the original goal it s the opposite it s good to keep separation between these two conflicting visions and not look at the whole space as being uniformly following the same path and goals here s a write up on the subject 	1

 deflation the ethics of money production by jorg guido hulsmann still another variant of the same basic fallacy that we just discussed is the alleged need to fight deflation the word deflation can be defined in various ways according to the most widely accepted definition today deflation is a sustained decrease of the price level older authors have often used the expression deflation to denote a decreasing money supply and some contemporary authors use it to characterize a decrease of the inflation rate all of these definitions are acceptable depending on the purpose of the analysis none of them however lends itself to justifying an artificial increase of the money supply the harmful character of deflation is today one of the sacred dogmas of monetary policy the champions of the fight against deflation usually present six arguments to make their case 14 1 one in their eyes it is a matter of historical experience that deflation has negative repercussions on aggregate production and therefore on the standard of living to explain this presumed historical record they hold 1 two that deflation incites the market participants to postpone buying because they speculate on ever lower prices furthermore they consider 1 three that a declining price level makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past these difficulties threaten to entail 1 four a crisis within the banking industry and thus a dramatic curtailment of credit 1 five they claim that deflation in conjunction with sticky prices results in unemployment and finally 1 six they consider that deflation might reduce nominal interest rates to such an extent that a monetary policy of cheap money to stimulate employment and production would no longer be possible because the interest rate cannot be decreased below zero however theoretical and empirical evidence substantiating these claims is either weak or lacking altogether 15 first in historical fact deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production long term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and or countries with increasing price levels even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long run growth 16 second it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions however this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production notice that in the presence of deflationary tendencies purchase decisions in general and consumption in particular does not come to a halt for one thing human beings act under the constraint of the stomach even the most neurotic misers who cherish saving a penny above anything else must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day and all others that is the great majority of the population will by and large buy just as many consumers goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment even though they expect prices to decline ever further they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later economists call this time preference in actual fact then consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment and this marginal reduction of consumer spending far from impairing aggregate production will rather tend to increase it the simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved that is they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment third it is correct that deflation especially unanticipated deflation makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past in the case of a massive deflation shock widespread bankruptcy might result such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms factories and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits however from the aggregate social point of view it does not matter who controls the existing resources what matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically it merely diminishes their monetary value which is why their present owners go bankrupt thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners the net impact on production is likely to be zero fourth it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks however for the same reasons that we just discussed while this might be devastating for some banks it is not so for society as a whole the crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed it follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land factories streets and so on in the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present day monetary authorities deflation certainly has much disruptive potential however as will become even more obvious in the following chapters it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply it reduces the wealth of fractional reserve banks and their customers debt ridden governments entrepreneurs and consumers but as we have argued such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment the destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often creative destruction in the schumpeterian sense 18 fifth in the past eighty years the sticky prices argument has played an important role in monetary debates according to this argument the manipulation of the money supply might be a suitable instrument to re establish a lost equilibrium on certain markets most notably on the labor market suppose that powerful labor unions push up nominal wage rates in all industries to such an extent that entrepreneurs can no longer profitably employ a great part of the workforce at these wages the result is mass unemployment but if it were possible to substantially increase the money supply then the selling prices of the entrepreneurs might rise enough to allow for the reintegration of the unemployed workers into the division of labor now the argument goes under a gold or silver standard this kind of policy is impossible for purely technical reasons because the money supply is inflexible only a paper money provides the technical wherewithal to implement pro employment policies thus we have here a prima facie justification for suppressing the natural commodity monies and supporting a paper money standard this argument grew into prominence during the 1920s in austria germany the united kingdom and other countries after world war ii it became something like a dogma of economic policy but this does not alter the fact that it is sheer fallacy and it is not even difficult to see the root of the fallacy the argument is in fact premised on the notion that monetary policy makers can constantly outsmart the labor unions the managers of the printing press can again and again surprise the labor union leaders through another round of expansionist monetary policy clearly this is a silly assumption and in retrospect it is very astonishing that responsible men could ever have taken it seriously the labor unions were not fooled faced with the reality of expansionist monetary policy they eventually increased their wage demands to compensate for the declining purchasing power of money the result was stagflation high unemployment plus inflation a phenomenon that in the past thirty years has come to plague countries with strong labor unions such as france and germany sixth another widespread fallacy is the idea that paper money could help to decrease the interest rate thus promoting economic growth if new paper tickets are printed and then first offered on the credit market so the argument goes the supply of credit is increased and as a consequence the price of credit interest declines cheap money is now available for businessmen all over the country they will invest more than they otherwise would have invested and therefore economic growth will be enhanced there are actually a good number of different fallacies involved in this argument and it is impossible for us to deal with all of them here 19 in short economic growth is diminished below the level it could otherwise have reached to sum up it is by no means sure that politically induced increases of the money supply will lead to a decrease of the interest rate below the level it would have reached in a free economy the success of cheap money policy is especially unlikely when the policy is not adopted on an ad hoc basis but turned into a guiding principle of economic policy but the fundamental objection to this policy is that it is counterproductive even if it succeeds in decreasing the interest rate the consequence would be more waste and thus less growth 14 for an overview see federal reserve bank of cleveland deflation 2002 annual report may 9 2003 r c k burdekin and p l siklos eds deflation current and historical perspectives cambridge

i am learning about bitcoin and i am seeking a help from this community as far as i understand nodes validate blocks and transactions and miners are not nodes although they also can be a node also while the bitcoin mining is currently heavily dominated by few mining pools such mining pools consist of many miners so if one mining pool has 51 of the total hashing power and sends invalid transactions these invalid transactions will not be propagated to the bitcoin network because peer nodes will not pass such invalid transactions to other nodes for this reason i wonder how 51 attract is possible in theory furthermore according to andreas antonopoulos if one nation or a super rich take 51 hashing power and attack the bitcoin network the attach would be capable of performing a double spending only once because the bitcoin network will detect this malicious transaction in the next block 10 minutes later i wonder how the network will detect this given that a longer chain is supposed to be considered as genuine i do not fully understand the concept of the bitcoin network so there can be errors in my question and the question itself is very messy i apology for this many thanks in advance 	1

hello everyone i ve been reading about bitcoin and really want to understand it completely so far i read that bitcoin use a peer to peer network this is used because bitcoin wants to eliminate the problem of double spending and in order to prove that the transaction was not double spent bitcoin use a hash based proof of work please correct me if i m correct with this especially so this is where the miners do their work their computers are the ones that solve the problem using proof of work and help approve that the transaction was indeed true thus creating the series of block chains in exchange of this work bitcoin is rewarded or created as long as these chains continue the possibility of hacking the transaction become close to impossible that s why this is important and thus explain why bitcoin is rewarded to the miners or there s a gain of bitcoin every time a block is created am i getting it right or am i way off completely will really appreciate if you will explain this to me like i m five because i don t have that much knowledge in programming or deep computer words i ll try to understand every explanations that will be given thank you very much tl dr every proof of work approved bitcoin rewarded please correct if i m wrong 	1

i ve been a part of the bitcoin community for awhile and i will soon finally be able to contribute to adoption a product my new startup has been working on will be going live soon 1 2 months i want to accept crypto most importantly btc and lightning but i would also like to accept some more popular alts for business purposes please don t crucify me amp x200b my question is which payment processors do the community like the most bitpay seems easy but everyone here hates it i understand why so many discourage it they support bch heavily and are custodial as a business owner custodial can actually be ideal as of the time of writing the simplest way to accept crypto imo is to use a third party that will take coins and fund the business bank account in dollars immediately this is mostly just due to accounting and tax purposes i want to run my business i don t have time to dick around with payment technicals and legalities amp x200b that being said who should i use note for personal coins i 100 believe in not your keys not your bitcoin for small businesses that just want to accept bitcoin without adding too much cost time overhead i think custodial processors or processors that immediately convert btc to fiat are fine this can easily be changed be simplifying or removing tax laws and by good accounting software in the coming years that integrates with wallets 	1

annotated notes from let s talk bitcoin episode 389 taken from professor meow on twitter andreas antonopolous my theory is that the way we re going to see lightning being used is that people will have the vast majority of their funds on lightning all the time the only funds that are not on lightning are the funds you keep in cold storage how do you make this jump between on chain and off chain i need to open a channel in order to start using lightning but then i want to get my bitcoin back i would have to close the channel i m going to have to do this opening and closing channel not too infrequently maybe i m opening and closing channels once a week or once a month and if everybody needs to do the same there s not enough capacity on the bitcoin blockchain to do that that s the wrong way of looking at it because you re not going to be doing that that s where splicing comes in what splicing allows you to do is blend the open channel close channel and on chain bitcoin outputs into a single transaction you re going to instead create a channel every time you do a bitcoin transaction there s no reason to take the change and put it back into an on chain wallet instead you fund channels every time you do a bitcoin transaction and you can do a bitcoin on chain transaction every time you rebalance close or open a channel and combine all of those functions so a single transaction can have as its inputs the multi sig of a closing channel as its outputs the multi sig of an opening channel and an on chain bitcoin transaction so you can basically splice bitcoin into a channel splice bitcoin from a channel out onto the bitcoin blockchain and simultaneously open and close channels in the same transaction this allows you to send bitcoin into a lightning channel send bitcoin from lightning out onto the bitcoin network make an on chain bitcoin payment close the channel and open a channel all four things in one transaction simultaneously every bitcoin transaction in which you re paying a fee becomes an opportunity to also open and close several channels and make other bitcoin payments adam b levine is the idea here just that users will be making transactions periodically and so this is a way to piggyback on existing traffic andreas antonopoulos bingo your wallet does all of this automatically depending on who you want to pay and whether they can be reached on chain or off chain to your wallet constructs your transaction and piggybacks as many open and closed channels as it needs to rebalancing other housekeeping duties and minimize your fees by batching together but wait there s more the main reason we use coinjoin is for obfuscation and privacy but if you think about it it also saves on transaction fees if you re going to do that transaction anyway and you get five other strangers to join you and do their transactions you pay one transaction fee across all of you one transaction with five times the outputs is a lot cheaper than five transactions this makes even more sense if you have for example an exchange that is doing withdrawals or deposits onto lightning and it has a whole bunch of customer withdrawals you know the classic batching problem that exchanges are trying to implement in order to save on fees adam b levine so what you re saying here is that splicing has implications that extend beyond single people and really this is a technology that could be extended to improve privacy and obfuscation or do you see this being set up like coinjoin where anyone can participate andreas antonopoulos this isn t just for obfuscation this is also a massive saving on channel transactions 	1
i saw few tweets from elon musk regarding bitcoin as title mention you have to remember that all their wealth is in fiat currencies entire business rely on banking systems they cannot talk too much because bitcoin is against currencies and actual banking systems if they talk too much they risk to have troubles with their banks however elon musk should be appreciated by his approach although he cannot say too much you have to give him credit for those few tweets all those big figures like bill gates and others like him they still use banking systems they don t want to have troubles with banks at this moment what you have to understand if you read in between the lines of statements from those big figures is i cannot say too much but go and get as much as you can bitcoin only few of them have the courage to say how important is blockchain in the future look at the number of coins you have in wallet rather then how much value in fiat they have hope you understand that lightning network made rest of coin almost useless 	1

hi all i have a strange occurrence which i need some help figuring out yesterday i was checking on my various electrum wallets by putting my seeds into electrum it was just a routine check to see they are there and everything is working my main wallets seed worked fine and showed the correct amount then i entered another seed i had written down and can t remember where it was from within that wallet was almost as much as my main wallet only there s no way i have collected this amount of btc in total now i think this stems from when i split my btc for bch last year out of the bch electrum wallet i followed the electrum org guide correctly with no problems my question is can two different seeds contain the same bitcoin if i mixed these two wallets would i be in danger of corrupting or in some way losing my main btc sorry from the long post i m quite confused by this 	0

now that btc block size is nearing it s limit again after dec 2017 and jan 2018 even during this bear market would it be possible to change the btc block size to a dynamic one so e g when 1mb is getting full the code d increase the block size to 2mb and if 2mb is getting full the code d increase the block size again to the next magnitude of 4mb etc then again when tx traffic slows down and 4mb blocks are getting empty the code d decrease the block size first to 2mb and if 2mb is also getting empty block size d be decreased back to 1mb this way the preferred block size would always be the smallest possible but it would increase during the rush hours if needed a solution between small and big blocks then the community doesn t have to childishly quarrel between small and big block size which only ends in stalemate situations the code could simply automatically decide the thing for us i think compromises have to be done in each front if consensus is the aim no compromises and hard forks like in 2017 are inevitable only the siths believe in absolutes 	0

a friend of mine invested in bitcoin during one of earlier mass media hypes in 2013 and forgot his wallet password after having bought a few of ico s in 2015 he d forgotten about it during the ice age and wrote it all off as a gambling loss until 2017 when the prices started skyrocketing he learned of the bonanza from a fb and realized he was sitting on 1m 5m and subsequently rented a few clusters to crack his pw took him 4 months but he was successful in the end now he s on an extended sabbatical though i feel his personal life is in turmoil amp x200b i m the one of a couple really close friends who knows of his fortunes and no one outside of his team of financial advisers amp accountants know about his windfall not even his family he s been having a lot of trouble coming to terms with it and he described it as a cliche of winning the lottery amp how money can t buy happiness his main concern is securely diversifying amp making this fortuitous stroke of luck last for the remainder of his life as a facilitator accelerator amp safe haven for his parents healthcare bills amp x200b most of us who jumped in around 2016 8 have tallied some significant losses but there are certainly some extremely few who have gotten fantastically rich i m curious what these few lucky guys think about the newfound riches and how it s upended the entire paradigm of working hard amp becoming successful as the primary modus operandi seems like my friend is dealing with an early mid life crisis of sorts amp navigating through the stark reality of good fortunes and some of its negative effects he says he s a bit bored of fast cars amp beautiful women who are really only interested in his money 	2
