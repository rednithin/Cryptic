i've been an investor in the stock market for the last 20 years. prior to that, i was a finance major in college. i'm presuming with the talk of 'lambos' 'hodl' and 'to the moon', that the typical crypto investor skews young (most 45 year olds don't talk that way - but that's ok. times change). what doesn't change, whether you are investing in stocks, gold or crypto are the fundamentals of investing. investing in whatever commodity is driven by a couple of factors - emotion and factors that directly impact the value of the commodity. now, that doesn't mean every commodity should be reviewed with the same metrics, or the allocation of emotion vs factors remains the same for each. but both are still true. the difference with stocks and crypto, right now, is emotion is directly affecting price probably to a 3-1 margin over impactful factors. however, emotion has a short-term effect. impactful factors a longer term affect. a good coin, stock, whatever is led by a team that has their head down on their product and looking to boost their revenue. they see a problem, desire, or need and believe they have the solution that will remedy that issue. ibm, ge and new stocks like amazon all fill that void. short-term, emotion will drive price up or down. long-term, it will be driven by the value of the asset. it's why bitcoin, so many years later, still continues to appreciate. they had a sound objective sure, there are dips and spikes, but the progress has been upward. the question you need to ask: are you in it as an investment (e.g. long-term) or get-rich quick (e.g. short-term). my advice to long-term investors is to find a coin you like and buy based on the objective and the team. ignore the financials. market cap, price, circulation. that's all bs. i'm sorry, as a technical analyst, i don't see the value in those metrics. particularly when those metrics are fueled by emotion. it goes back to find a coin you like and hold it for a long duration. as for the 'get-rich' crowd. good luck. it's a crap shoot. make no mistake about it. you can say you chose well and did your research and timed the market. but when the market is appreciating 100x or more per year, it doesn't take much luck to get a return. don't let all these guys who've made 100ks steer you because you think they are experts. they are not. the market is too new and, more than that, too emotional. i'd almost trust a psychologist than a professional investor to figure out this market. i laugh at some of the impactful market factors and the assumptions on what's driving the market. its 90% emotion right now. here's the question, other than fraud/fake coins - how many 'real' coins have lost total value? few or none. in an efficient market, the bad coins would have been bankrupt. but that's not happening to real coins. heck, doge is still appreciating when it hasn't been updated in years and the creator is scratching his head about the value. it's emotion. pure and simple. that's why the crypto day-traders are afraid of regulation. a rising tide takes all ships. so, the long-term investor is going to receive the same success. the difference? in five years, a majority of the long-term investors will have a better ror than the short-term/day trader. don't believe me? how many dot com day traders investors are still rich today? how many of those companies exist? some, but not many. what is happening now is what happened in 2000. emotion and new people that believe they could time the market, ended up eventually losing everything. fundamentals. i kept my investments after the market crash in 2008. i believed in the companies i was holding and the market. fundamentals is what will make you money. and you know what? as everyone here is so focused on high risk/high reward of crypto - i've made 10%+ holding in the market over the last 30 days. not sure how many can honestly claim the same in crypto over that same period. will crypto beat the market this year? very possibly. but the risk is higher. and that's my last point. please do not put your total portfolio in crypto. another absolute bedrock of investing - high risk = high reward. high risk means you can lose it too. day traders during dot com didn't heed that warning. and many lost. i'm holding 10% in crypto. the way i see it, my downside is minimal, but if we get another 1000x return, i'm still going to be doing very well for myself. good luck to everyone!	1
before you begin, if you don't understand why xrp is useful to banks in the first place, please read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/7pgvyc/heres_how_and_why_xrp_will_be_used_by_banks/ also, please do me the kind consideration of reading this entire article, and the comments. i get a lot of repeat comments and i'll just ignore you if you ask the same question that i've already addressed. now i won't attempt to put a dollar value prediction out there, that's just a waste of time and even if i was right, i'm wrong, because i was lucky. anybody, any news article, any company, and especially any technical analysis that draws converging fucking triangles (my favorite), attempting to predict price direction or values, is utterly and completely full of shit. the past few years are soooo riddled with stupid prediction after stupid prediction, catering to the psychic-seeking greedy twits that just want some relief from the stress of waiting for their coin of choice to parabolically vindicate their investment decisions. i'm going to tell you what actually drives this market. in order of influence: 1) **whale bots!** thousands of very big holders have software performing trades on their behalf on every exchange, in real-time. because of their sizable positions, they create buy/sell walls (some visible, some not), and they artificially dampen the price with thousands of micro sales during periods of low volatility to make the price seem like it's crashing, shaking out loose hands so they can lap up your cheap xrp, etc. these bastards are 90% responsible for whatever price we see. in other words, whales pick the price. 2) **whale collaboration.** yes, they work together, either organically or in collusion (otherwise they'd be battling each other and it just wouldn't work), and they have a specific agenda for setting the prices such that they achieve certain public perceptions. the first ...

hi everyone! it's been rough these past few weeks finding out my wonderful dog has cancer. if it wasn't for my investment in ripple from mid-dec, i wouldn't be able to afford giving her the best possible treatments right now. so thanks to everyone that gives us important updates and for being a supportive community! fyi, i don't trade ripple. i purchased it as an investment because i believe in what ripple is trying to achieve!	1
assuming people would make their own individual donations when they eventually cash out however, this seems like a really cool way for us as a sub to do something v meaningful as a group, would be quite a celebration for reaching such a milestone we could even have people propose charities and we choose one or two to donate to. if the charities particularly worked with the ‘unbanked’ or microfinance that would seem to be quite fitting for what we’re all passionate about on here, i think the particular charity would be pretty stoked to get a generous donation somewhat out of the blue from a group of crypto enthusiasts ! based on how big the sub is now we could be talking hundreds of thousands of dollars to a good cause post your thoughts, feelings, reactions, clearly we don’t know when this point will happen (investor confidential reckon end of 2018) but we can hopefully come back to this and get it going around the $6\7 mark....... <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< **update - 3/1/18** wow guys and gals, this is all pretty impressive proud to say i’m part of this xrp community ! seriously, this is awesome based on the upvotes over about 12 hours we’re already looking at 1000 xrp at $10 dollars a pop, v cool firstly, my apologies for the length of this, probably not neccesary but trying (probably a bit too hard) to be of assistance! i guess there’s a few ways we could do this, firstly, i would say, i don’t think we have to put in motion just yet, i guess once we start creeping up to $6\7 (by which time we’ll be #1 , every major news outlet we’ll have xrp articles coming out of their ears, and brad will be a gazillionaire ! ) then i think we get this going. as people have said, not only will this be a meaningful way to help out one or two good causes as a community, i think it will be a nice antidote to us all focussing on our own riches, and obviously good pr for this fantastic sub-red i think we should choose a max of 3 charities to donate to, perhaps depending on our numbers at that time. i suggest we keep this post as our go to on this topic, i suggest we all get stuck in and comment with charities we would like considered for the 3 we select. there’s obviously a lot of needy causes out there. however, so this chimes with our interests on this sub i suggest we do focus our suggestions on charities that work with the ‘unbanked’, microfinance, technology etc. i guess that will also just help to narrow down what could end up being a v v v long list of charities otherwise. so, when we’re all at that $6\7 dollar mark, we’ve all commented with our charity suggestions, i suggest 1) someone does a sift through the suggestions to make sure there’s no anomalies, organisations that are not charities or charities v much unrelated what we’re wanting to focus on this time round 2) suggest then all the suggestions go in a hat, we pull out 10(?) and these become our 10 to vote on. (before the vote happens i suggest we check each charity is registered with the relevant authority as a proper charity, e.g. here in u.k. we have something called the charity commission and every legal charity has a reg. number, just so we’re not gonna be sending our gift to something dodge) 3) we all look into the 10, comment/chat as we like, and then cast our votes, the well deserving winners get our gift to help out those of us on this planet struggling a little more than we are ! i think it would be pretty cool, when we have our charities, one of us writes a note to them , could do it as a sub post with comments below, telling them who we are, why we’re a community and wishing them the very best with our gift. as to paying the money, i think we probably want to keep this process as simple and direct as possible. i don’t think any of us want an intermediary between our donations and the charities. if we make our payments individually from us to the charities i think it would be cool for each of us to comment on here as we do it so we can keep a tally as a community and get a sense of what our contribution looks like. little doubt, in a few years time, paying direct in xrp to most organisations will be simple, however, if we reach our target soonish that may not be poss, also depending on the charity, suggest we keep it 1 xrp or 1xrp worth lastly, i just want to say, i don’t at all mean to assume that we’re all in the same boat in terms of our lifestyle, income, money etc. this is a very diverse sub, which i think is what makes it a great forum. some people are new here, some people have modest xrp holdings, some have v significant holdings and are maybe a dollar away from life changing amounts. however, i hope this gift to charity is done in a way where we all feel included. the individual amount 1 xrp i think is modest on its own but as a v diverse growing community it becomes pretty cool	1
i purchase a ledger from ebay, from a reputable seller. the ledger was new and sealed, it did not look in anyway that it had be compromised. i used the ledger wallet for 4 weeks, buying xrp, dash. litecoin and bitcoin totally original investment of £7000, i had over 5000 xrp, over the space of 4 weeks that £8000 grow to £25000 due to the increase in all the coins values, then on yesterday when i check my ledger i found that all the coins had been transferred out of my accounts on the 4th january. i later discovered after speaking to a number of people including ledger that my ledger had been compromised, someone had already put the seed words into it then insert a very legit looking seed recovery card (https://imgur.com/dsickge) with a scratch off panel, i really thought the seed recovery card was legit. this has been a huge blow to me, have not had anything to eat or sleep since i discovered the lost of all my coins. i have never fallen for any scams, and this is the first time. i am really hoping this does not happen to anyone else.	1
"cross-posted from /r/ethtrader. as many as possible in the crypto space should be educated. here is his post: [all my cryptocurrency stolen](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7obot7/all_my_cryptocurrency_stolen/) here's where we find out how he was scammed. the scam ledger nano (bought on ebay) came with a ""scratch off"" paper, to reveal the seed words. with a real ledger nano, the seed words are generated by the device. [""the ledger came with a recovery sheet which had a 24 word recovery seed, to see the seed i had to scratch off the silver foil/paint that was covering it.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7obot7/all_my_cryptocurrency_stolen/ds8khhw/) some other people have come across the same scam: [latest ledger nano s](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7i12x5/latest_ledger_nano_s/) [""bought one off ebay got the same thing myself 100% scam""](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7i12x5/latest_ledger_nano_s/dqvdulw/) [picture of the fake ""scratch off"" paper with seed words.](https://imgur.com/dsickge.jpg) [pictures of the scam instructions](https://imgur.com/a/pw9l0) brutal scam."	1
"i've seen this over and over and over, ""banks don't need to use xrp to use the ripple ledger"". true! but, here's why some are already using, and will all use xrp eventually. ripple's approach to adoption is two-fold: 1) get the banks to use their ledger software to send fiat money (without necessarily requiring xrp), instead of the swift way. this step is important because it doesn't radically change the way banks do things today, but it does give them some very valuable tools and real-time information about their money transfers. this is what most ripple-partnered banks are talking about when they say they are using ripple's products. what also comes with this software is a ripple feature called xrapid, which leads us to step.. 2) once banks are ripple-integrated, they will have the 'option' of using xrp (via ripple's xrapid feature), but they don't have to; but they will want to eventually; let me explain: the first adoption step puts the option to use xrp right in front of the banks' noses. and while at this time it may seem irrelevant to their existing infrastructure, it will be profoundly easy to start using xrp if they get curious. why would they want to use xrp then? - it would take very little effort to start using the integrated xrapid feature - they would save an additional 30% on transfer fees - their competitors are using it, undercutting them and taking business away - and most importantly: eliminates nostro accounts!!!!! let me say that again because it's super important using xrp eliminates the need for nostro accounts!!!...

i've had an awesome day watching xrp rise and want to give back some love to the community. i'm giving 100xrp to the person who guesses closest to the price at midday (12pm) on dec 25 at bitstamp. i will use the symbol xrpusd (bitstamp) at www.tradingview.com your guess should be to five decimal places. a tie will mean i'll split the xrp between winners. happy christmas patient people! 2018 is going to be great! edit: i forgot to mention a cut-off date. i'm going to freeze comments/guesses in 24 hours. good lcuk! edit: upvote, gawd darn it! 72 comments and 12 upvotes...wtf!	2
i see that you have had a change of heart and have returned my cryptocurrency back to my scam ledger, and i see now you are trying to make things right, but if you are reading this i need you to do one more thing. the ledger was reset so i try to recover the seed using the scam 24 word recovery card that was included with the ledger (https://imgur.com/dsickge), but the seed on this recovery card is not the same seed that was preinstalled on my ledger when i purchased it, hence i cannot access the cryptocurrency you returned back to me. can you please please do one of the follow things - send me the 24 word seed that were originally on the ledger so i can access that account, you can private message me here in reddit i know you are trying to make amends and to end all this, but as long as you are the only one to have access to this seed (account) and i cannot access it, it is still classed as stolen and as such still looking at a 5 - 7 year jail sentence, but this can all be avoided if you just send me the seed or send the currency to my new wallets. you have made the first step in returning the currency now please make the next and last step to allow me access to it, then all this will be over. please can everybody spread the word and again please do not send me donations.	1
it's the new year and like most of you i am sat daydreaming with my partner at what could happen, but we actually have 6 good indications of when the price may go up this year already... 1. japanese banks officially adopting xrp (january 31st) 2. amex adopting ripple and xrp (within 6 months) 3. announcement of two household names joining ripple and hopefully xrp (asap / should have been last week?) 4. coinbase confirming the listing of xrp (currently speculation) 5. coinbase listing xrp (this will bring the biggest hike) 6. overtaking bitcoin on marketcap so whether it's an increase of $1 or $20 i wish you all a very profitable new year x ... edit: i'm getting a few direct messages demanding that i provide sources for my points above... please can you keep in mind the use of the word potential in the title. this post was to say that 2018 is already looking like a positive year for xrp and even if just one of these points comes into fruition, the price will go up. also i am not associated with anyone else on this site or shilling to get the price up... i mean wow. some helpful links: 1. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/asia.nikkei.com/amp/business/deals/japan-south-korea-blockchain-payments-enter-trials-friday 2. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/16/american-express-santander-team-up-with-ripple-on-blockchain-platform.html 3. https://twitter.com/joelkatz/status/943638218984996865?lang=en	2
edit: 4 years. https://i.redd.it/twe79v68sea01.jpg just reposting what others have said in comments of other threads. don't murder the messenger. i'm in the same newbie boat as almost everyone else here. this does seem worse than normal, but what do i know. as soon as i think one thing the market turns around and does the opposite. maybe this is the end of it all and we're all doomed! ahhh! did that fix it? o_o old post: if anything, everyone should be supper excited about this crash. it means the market is continuing to move exactly as it has in the past. it makes the odds that the market will recover and continue to grow extremely likely. what would have been much more scary is if we had not hit this dip. if things had just kept going up and up it would have indicated the market had shifted and a huge bubble (that the news and all the crypto haters so loves to proclaim) was actually forming. as it stands, all indicators are that the market is just growing at its normal rate, in its normal way.	1
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/01/19/xrapid-cost-savings-confirmed-by-cuallix/ xrp has now reached an adoption point that every fintech startup dreams about - official confirmation of its product's measurable value to business and individuals. with cuallix's formal confirmation of xrp's cost savings two days ago, it's clear that xrp's path is pointed upwards; when will it take the #1 spot? it's up to the market, but i provide my opinion on what this means for ripple and the industry. hope you enjoy the read! please leave any feedback below, and i will make an effort to respond. thank you, -hodor	1
"hi all, as some of you i was early in following this sub at sub 10.000 subscribers of r/ripple. over the past year i found many of us very helpful in explaining to and helping out newcomers. however, in recent weeks, as our community has grown significantly, we get flooded by newcommers asking simple things such as: which wallet? where to buy? what is ripple vs xrp? etc. what i see more often is people reacting to these newb questions with answers such as: ""i am getting sick of these posts. use the search function"". this behavior of newbs on fora is as old as the internet. to think this will ever stop is a foolish thought. we all want mass adoption since then we all benefit. i argue that we should be happy with all these newb questions. these people are currently helping us to drive up the price. and for each person asking on this subreddit, there are most likely 10s not asking cause they are afraid to ask newbish questions. so i argue that in stead of complaining to these people, we should welcome them nicely and help them in the best way possible. if you hate it so much, please refrain from commenting on these posts at all if you will not contribute any value. personally i would love to see the subreddit flood witth these questions as we add more and more subscribers and take xrp to new heigths. those that are with me, upvote this so more of the older members will see it too. to all newcommers, welcome to r/ripple, enjoy the ride and hodl to 🌝 #xrpthestandard"	1
"very interesting change of tone these last few months... i'm one of the ""crypto"" guys in my community and have often been asked about bitcoin - people have began asking me more about ripple recently which is fascinating. some of these traditional investors are very comfortable and attracted to the idea of investing in xrp long term vs. bitcoin. they really like that ripple/xrp has a strong use case and potential to add major value to the financial system accompanied with the fact that it's being directed by super talented team of individuals. nothing against bitcoin at all but it's interesting to see ripple start to click in peoples heads while they still struggle to understand the role bitcoin plays in the future."	2
david schwartz (/u/sjoelkatz) is the chief cryptographer at ripple. he's been in the bitcoin community since 2011. while i don't advocate getting all your info from one person, without a doubt he is the best at explaining foreign concepts that i have seen in the crypto community. my advice to newbies is to listen to and read the media he's involved in (youtube videos, reddit comments, stackoverflow) and to think critically about everything you hear. **to understand the tech:** [watch this presentation on the ripple protocol [30 minutes talk, 30 minutes q&a]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7abkus9tyzg) [watch this 20 minute interview on ripple's tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gynxedecyng) [read his comments on bitcoin stackexchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/users/85/david-schwartz) **to understand the direction:** look at his reddit profile (/u/sjoelkatz), and go back a few months. read every comment he posts, and read every thread he posted in. google every term you don't understand. this should take a while, but it's worth it. here's a few good ones: * [why can't banks just use ripple technology and just scrap xrp](https://np.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/6w4i9w/why_cant_banks_just_use_ripple_technology_and/dm5at3g/?st=jbgn3yz4&sh=861c6727) * [mathematically speaking what is the highest price ripple could potentially get to?](https://np.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/6irqhs/mathematically_speaking_what_is_the_highest_price/dj8qctq/?st=jbgn4or1&sh=3911c204) * [help me understand please!!!](https://np.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/6j3ov9/help_me_understand_please/djbbevm/?context=3&st=jbgn5an0&sh=3bc1efdb)	1

hi fellow xrpers. things have been messy for the past few days and don't we all wish we'd sold at tree fiddy so we could have bought so much more xrps right now? but don't get yourself all fu*d up. we have seen the price fall, and rally, and fall again, touching new (high) lows. at the moment, we're selling for 2.20 on bitstamp and it looks bleak, but you know, it could very well go lower. don't panic. the thing is that so much of the price climb was due to...the price climb. buyers were flooding in because it was going up. so it went up, and up, and upper. even after the first fall, and when it rallied again, a lot of the people who were just trying to make a quick buck were holding on. the cryptomarket is all about prospective bettors looking to make fast money. now that xrp movement has stabilized, you can expect the impatient people who are just going for quick profits to move on, even if it's at a loss, because they don't want to pay the opportunity cost of holding on to boring old xrps. so just hold on. news will eventually come. the price will climb again, and the gamblers will flood in once more, inflating the price.	0
"literally all i've been seeing on this subreddit is people asking why xrp is seemily stable at $2.00. everyone who's invested that is asking the question ""why isnt xrp going up"" are the type of people who think xrp is the same as bitcoin and will suddenly rise a few thousand dollars overnight. it's laughable. there is no doubt about it, ripple is a frontrunner in this market and will succeed in the long term but instead of everyone making posts asking why it isn't going up faster, how about you spread the word about ripple and xrp instead of writing moany posts on here that you haven't made a lambo money overnight. rant over."	1

coinbase has about 13 million subscribers. dmm group has about 27 million subscribers. xrp will be listed on dmm group's cryptocurrency exchange in a few days. would that lead to a huge, perhaps unprecedented, jump in price? considering the hype that went into coinbase speculation, how will the market react to something we already know will happen - which will substantially increase demand, and, as one would anticipate, the price too? source: https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-dmm-crypto-exchange-launch/	1

about a year ago i decided to take a friends tip and invested in xrp and eth. my life wasn't in a great place and i was in a tremendous amount of credit card debt but was able to use some of the eth to dig out of the hole while holding on to the xrp. i told myself i would hold until i could afford to pay my debt down completely. well, last month i finally paid off all of my debt while also giving some money to my brother to pay for part of his college tuition. if you find a coin and believe in the founders and the platform and its many applications don't be afraid to hold. i'm not a millionaire, hell not even a hundred-thousandaire but i am debt free and am able to help out my family.	2
"just saying. for the record i'm hodl'ing. but i'm not going to sit here and pretend like i don't care. i bought coins ranging from the .97 cents - $2.70-ish range. it wasn't money i couldn't afford to lose but that doesn't mean that i don't care if i lose it. even if i were as rich as bill gates and i dropped a penny on the ground i'd probably still try and pick it up out of principle. i think the majority of people posting about how much they ""don't care"" are actually the most insecure people on here and actually care the most, even if they haven't admitted it to themselves. let's hope xrp makes a comeback. hodl"	1
i gotta admit, looking back i kinda wish i sold at 3.30. however, from the very beginning this planned on being a long term investment, mainly for tax purposes and because i believe in the tech. i truly believe it will surpass its ath. whether that be next week or next year we all just need to be patient and realize how young this market really is. i'm only going to say this once, hodl my friends. btw, got in at .20 and .27 it seems like there's a lot of us still hodling on	2
rippled 1.0 released! it is on the release branch of their github now, ready to be used by their customers! take a look: https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/release this is great news. :-)	1
"...this is a very natural and very expected correction. when you basically quadruple in price in a week, a correction is 100% to be expected. remember, forward 3 steps back 2 steps. it has proven to be the golden rule of crypto's and ripple is no exception. this is not a crash or even a dip, for that matter. this is a very mild correction. i honestly do not understand why anyone would be concerned or even the slightest bit surprised by this? edit: i can't even call this a ""correction"". a correction would be at like $1.75. this is honestly still very much in the ""to the moon"" (for all you dreamers) conversation. so everyone relax."	2
#6 crucial things i learned in 2017. &nbsp; as i find it difficult to share this story with friends and family so i turn to this community. they either don’t understand or think everything that sounds like crypto is a bubble. &nbsp; also i hope that this story might help others to avoid the mistakes i made. &nbsp; **tldr:** * **i fundamentally believe in xrp and ~10x’ed my fiat so far (compared to $),** * **could have 15x’ed if i would have not have made emotional decisions based on greed, fomo and fud,** * **make rules for yourself and stick to them. period,** * **i will buy xrp till $5,** * **bitstamp is a great exchange but at some point definitely secure your holdings with some level of paranoia.** &nbsp; this story is about my personal journey on the xrp train. a story about fundamental analysis, fomo (fear of missing out), fud (fear uncertainty and doubt), my greed, emotional trading, belief in xrp and patience. &nbsp; my journey started with bitcoin actually in ~ 2013. i had this friend who kept talking about this bitcoin that will change the world. &nbsp; it was around $600 at the time, i told him he was crazy and it was a bubble, without even researching it i waved his words away. &nbsp; the higher btc rose, the more effort i made to tell him it was a bubble and it would crash. &nbsp; at some point it did, after reaching ~1200 or so. major crash. i was right! &nbsp; in ~ 2014 i had to buy a few btc to perform a transaction on a infamous dark web market place that is no longer. &nbsp; after that, i forgot about bitcoin and crypto currencies…. &nbsp; fast forward to january 2017. crypto is on my radar again, it’s still there… &nbsp; i start reading and following the rapid growth of btc until april 2017. i don’t understand btc craze. of course, it was the first, the tech is revolutionary but there are some problems for me; &nbsp; * high transaction fees, </br> * centralised mining power, * no immediate real world use case, * distribution graph of btc wallet holdings favours a small percentage, * incredibly bad for the environment. &nbsp; also i found out about this ‘other thing’, xrp. &nbsp; the more i read the more i believe in the fundamentals; * ripple labs, inc. is venture backed by google, andreesen & horrowitz, accenture, sbi (usd 100m of funding); * aiming to replace swift (society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication, founded in 1973!); * ripple labs, inc’s digital token xrp has transaction speeds of under 5 seconds and fees of less than a cent $; * works together with banks in stead of against them. &nbsp; i soon figure out this crucial part: >if banks adopt ripple’s software and later xrp as a bridge for international transfers they will likely need to purchase xrp to execute these transfers &nbsp; >if banks for example need to send $10 billion, there needs to be sufficient liquidity in the xrp market for such a large usd amount to flow through xrp. &nbsp; in may 2017, xrp is 0.22 usd with a market cap of ~ 9 billion usd. >how the hell will banks be able to send large amounts of fiat through xrp without causing massive price swings? &nbsp; they cannot. i figured that if banks were going to use xrp to send let’s say usd 1 trillion on a daily basis xrps unit price would need to be waaayy higher. &nbsp; let’s imagine 75% of the coins is being held and not actively trading. 25% of the total supply is being traded on a daily basis. for 1 trillion usd to pass through that 25% should be at least valued at 1 trillion usd. but likely higher because everyone involved in this want a stable price. &nbsp; i thought that if ripple succeeds and banks adopt ripple’s software, it is likely that ripple will convince banks to use xrp as well. &nbsp; betting on ripple the company i believed that xrp was massively undervalued at .22 usd, especially in comparison with coins such as btc, ltc and some others. &nbsp; after reading up on ripple and xrp for 2 months straight i decided to buy in for 20% of my net worth (yes, huge gamble and not recommended). &nbsp; i buy bitcoin at a local broker with a ~4% spread and send the btc to bitstamp. upon arrival on bitstamp a few hours later i realise that some of my btc is missing. high transaction fees and a relatively big spread between the broker’s price and the price on bitstamp i find out later. &nbsp; i told myself to hold xrp for 5 years. &nbsp; this is how my journey goes after that: * end of may 2017, purchased xrp at .22$, * two weeks later: sending 50% of xrp to another exchange and fomo it into eth, * end of august i panic sell my eth for fiat with a 30% loss, i invested more than i could afford to lose at that time, * between august and october fud hits me, this coin is going nowhere. i even accomplish to forget about crypto for a few weeks. * october 18, i fomo into xrp again during swell and tripple my holdings at .27$, * dec 6, xrp is going nowhere still, was i wrong? everything rises but not us.. * i read on reddit that diversifying is good and i plan on spreading my crypto holdings (eth, neo, xbr, ada and iota) * i send 10% of my xrp to another exchange to buy ada at .09$, * i send 10% of my xrp to another exchange to buy iota (fomo) at 3.5$ * within a few days i sell my iota at 4.27$ and leave that particular exchange, it’s a shitty exchange, * dec 13, i get greedy with my xrp profit and sell at .38$, hoping to buy back lower, * dec 13, price rises and i fomo and buy back xrp at .39$, * dec 14, i increase my xrp holding by 50% coming from fiat, &nbsp; at this point i am still high in profits (could be more if i did not sell though..) &nbsp; * dec 14, ada moons. * dec 14, xrp rises further, i feel incredibly smart and get greedy. i will now day trade and make even more gains. i think it will correct and sell 30% of my holdings at .65$, i will buy back lower i think, * dec 14, xrp rises further and i am fomo again, buy back the 30% at .78$, * i feel so stupid, * dec 17, i sell ada for btc at ath of .55$, i am so smart, * i convert it all back to xrp, * dec 21, greed hits again and i want to buy back lower after the correction. i sell 20% at .92$ and place by orders at .80$, * dec 22, xrp moons and i fomo once more, i buy back at 1.24$, &nbsp; as of now i feel very happy with 10x gains on the total fiat amount i put in. however i also feel stupid for not sticking to my plan of holding xrp for 5 years without trading. if i had stuck to my plan i would have been up 15x by now. &nbsp; my new plan: * i toke all my xrps offline and stored it very securely with tin-hat + hyper paranoia mentality, * increase my xrp holdings and buy with fiat until $5 and diversify my storage into multiple places/ledgers, * at $10, cash out all fiat investments i made, all the paper profit and loss is on the house from now on, * hold my xrp at least till end of 2020, all or nothing. &nbsp; i learned some things: * make your own plan and stick to it, * consider all your investment in xrp or any other crypto to be lost, * never ever make any financial decision when you emotional (panic, euphoric, greedy, etc..), * if you believe in the fundamentals of xrp just hold, be patient, * if you are not a trader by profession don’t think you will be a good crypto trader after reading some stuff online, it is very unlikely that you will be able to time the market, you might make some profits in the short run for sure but the stress and emotion is real and you’re basically just gambling even more than when you are only holding (that’s already enough of a gamble), * reflect on your own behaviour once in a while, what caused you to buy/sell? &nbsp; hopefully this story might be of some use. &nbsp; to all /r/ripple'ers, big thanks; especially to those answering questions from newcomers and to those keeping thus sub high quality and free of memes and other low quality posts. &nbsp; wishing everyone a great start of 2018 and **happy holding!**	1
one of the things i love about this sub is that it's full of rational human beings who are capable of critical thought. it's not a raving circle jerk. but i am starting to see it get a little carried away, like many of the other subs out there, in downvoting dissenters and aggressively combatting any perceived fud. there were posts last week strongly urging the community to resist the temptation to silence dissent, in hopes that we avoid tunnel vision and rampant hostility to varying perspectives. i'd like to just reiterate that. we need to do better at keeping the following things in mind: * ripple has a strong team, and there are many, many reasons to believe in the future of xrp. but none of us really knows the future for sure. our confidence is borne of belief and research, but none of us has a crystal ball. * there are many different types of people here - and a wide range of net worths and situations. for some people, a long term hodl makes sense, but there are others who have debts to pay or expenses to manage. when someone considers taking profits out of xrp to pay off real life obligations or set aside an emergency fund, we really need to keep our perspective and be supportive. * luckily this sub isn't full of lambo/moon posts, but that's a good thing and it needs to stay that way. the faster money comes into a highly speculative investment, the faster it can come out, so all of us are better served by a slow methodical rise. a healthy amount of hype is good - important in fact - but too much hype can create the kind of volatility that can erode long term confidence, which is the key to long term gains. * all cryptocurrencies are highly speculative, this one included. none of us really knows for sure who the long term victors will be. let us be an example to the crypto community, by continuing to support multiple view points, and cheering on the gains and successes of our peers, regardless of where they come from. this is not a zero sum game. * let's focus on using this this subreddit mainly to educate, discuss, and assist - not to celebrate our paper profits. those of us who believe in this plan to be here for a long time, so the day to day fluctuations of the market matter less and less the further out you look. i.e. what xrp is worth in 2019, not friday * positivity goes such a long way. when the hardcore xrp fud squad spreads their bile, be humble and kind. they are no threat to us. educate them, and hopefully we can all make money together. happy investing and good luck! to us all!	2
in addition to the bank of england, the [saudi arabian monetary authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saudi_arabian_monetary_authority) is also an official, paying customer of ripple. brad spilled the beans a couple weeks ago during the blockchain connect conference: [http://www.sohu.com/a/220864864_257855](http://www.sohu.com/a/220864864_257855) google translate from mandarin: >even if the blockchain technology develops, i do not think the government will disappear. when i consider overseas markets, such as china, i think we should cooperate with the people's bank of china. this is why ripple works only with regulated exchanges: **the bank of england and the saudi arabian monetary authority are our paying customers**. mas (singapore), the japanese central bank, and the u.s. fed have been talking or working with ripple for a while now, but from brad's comments it seems like there's no formal business relationship with them quite yet. he's also hinting at the chinese central bank, too...	1

i remember back in january there was a guy posting that prices would be over $2 in feb, and at $5 (!) in march. he failed terribly. and so does everyone in this sub. let's admit it, we all gambled some amount of money (loose change of most i hope) and we have no idea whether we'll end up with $10 or $10,000. i'm just saying this because i've been stalking this sub for months, and every day there are post predicting bullshit, or posting meaningless news as evidence that we are about to get rich. don't get me wrong, it's fine to have hope and all of that, but let's be realist and understand that this is a gamble, no one here has a clue about how the market will look like in a year or even a month, and most people posting predictions are just talking bullshit. now, i know this will get downvoted most probably, i just wanted to say it.	1
with the appointment of zoe cruz, i did some research on the entirety of ripple's board members and compiled in list form their employment history, accolades/awards, and other board relationships. i know most of this info is on rippple's board site, but having it in list form is sometimes easier for me to read and process. i put this together for my own research, hoping this will be helpful to others. seeing the many accomplishments and powerful connections ripple's board has made me even more confident of my investment in xrp. to me, xrp is an investment in people, not just a currency or a technology. if i can trust the people running the show, it gives me more faith in xrp's future. most interesting person to research was susan athey. she is also on the board at expedia.com, who owns homeaway, an airbnb competitor. i know people have been guessing what those [two household names](https://www.xrpchat.com/topic/12970-2-huge-household-names/) are, and i've seen airbnb including in the discussion. if people are speculating that airbnb is one of the names, i think it makes sense that a competitor like homeaway/expedia should be considered as well. but this is just pure speculation. if you're interested, susan athey also held a [quora session](https://www.quora.com/session/susan-athey/1) back in jan 2016. she answered a couple questions on the future of bitcoin and ripple. anyways, here's the list: **gene sperling** *president, sperling economic strategies (present) *director of the national economic council (2011-2014) *counselor to treasury secretary timothy geithner (2009-2011) *chief economic adviser for hillary clinton's 2008 presidential campaign *director of the national economic council for the clinton administration (1996-2001) *deputy director of the national economic council for the clinton administration (1993-1996) founder and director of the center for universal education at the council on foreign relations and the brookings institution. named one of the 100 most powerful people in finance worldwide in 2013 by worth magazine. named one of the 50 most powerful people in washington by gq in 2012. **takashi okita** *ceo, sbi ripple asia (2016-present) *co-founder and ceo, econtext asia, leading provider of online payment services and e-commerce solutions (2012-2015) *co-ceo, sbi research co.,ltd (2009-2015) *co-founder and ceo, veritrans, leading online payment solution provider in japan (2005-2015) non executive director of softbrain co,.ltd.

i just want to give the people on this sub another perspective on ripple. this will be a long post :) in the last few months this community grew and about 90% of the posts all talk about the current price, where it might go, some insane predictions for coming years, with no basis at all. also there are a lot of posts drawing some stuff on plots and drawing some conclusions from these, which in all honesty seem like mostly bullshit. the crypto market is not regulated at all, therefore anything can happen at any time. also this market is a huge bubble, any sane person can see that. a burst of this bubble is bound to happen because too many people have no idea what they are doing. in the end the products that have an application will survive the rest will die this is the reason why i want to look at it from a more technical perspective, particularly from a software engineers perspective. in essence ripple labs is a software company selling a software product to customers. now anybody working as a dev in these days knows about agile development strategies. pretty much any software company today follows these principles, some more some less. so the agile community preaches the principle, that planning a software product completely with all the details, then implementing and releasing it can cause massive problems, since in the conceptional and implementation phase there is no input from the customers, the actual users of the product. so instead most of the companies focus on small manageable features and release them in a much quicker release cycle than before. you plan one feature, implement it, and then immediately release it to the customers to get feedback and implement the feedback. of course when providing financial institutions with software this is not always possible, since the quality requirements given there are insane. but still this is kind of visible in the strategy of ripple. i'm paraphrasing here but in an interview brad once said that they currently are doing one thing, the thing they are doing good, which is payments. xrp as a value transfer asset is just the tip of the iceberg, there are a whole lot of different possible applications for this asset. but usually software projects which try to do everything fail, because they fail to do the basic things good. so what i want to say is that there is a lot of room for growth and adoption, what we are seeing now is the first iteration of hopefully many to come. investing based on plots and price predictions in my opinion is a bad move, since there is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of bullshit going around, especially in online communities. look at the company, look at how they work and what they are doing. a prime example of this that i often use is dropbox, the first iteration of their product was literally a website with a sign up button, nothing more. when you pressed the button you could enter your email to be notified when the product was available. again projects involving fis are under much more scrutiny therefore it is a bit different, but the concept still applies. their move to offer xcurrent independent from xrp is actually great imo, since fis can test the product without the need to overly commit to the product. this allows ripple to gather feedback and improve their product. from a tech perspective the product is sound, as well as their strategy. people also often forget about xvia (mostly people talk about money transfers between banks) which allows retail businesses to use xrp, this is amazing for online companies operating worldwide, there is huge market. in essence what i want to say is that this is a software company, with a ceo coming from the tech industry. do not focus on the price of xrp, focus on the tech. what they are doing from a tech perspective is perfectly sound, and what they are building is a great product with a promising future. again compare todays dropbox to the sign up button. growth takes time, because trust takes time. rushing a software product has pretty much always failed. fis need security and reliability, it takes years for a bank to move to a new software system and commit to it, because such systems are extremely complex, and nothing but time and intelligent engineering can prevent such projects from crashing. so instead of trying to predict the next price jump or reading tas from some guy on the internet, maybe inform yourself on the tech, this will give you confidence. edit: typo edit 2: typo... addendum: there are some good questions coming in the comments. i will submit another post adressing these. its a bit difficult to answer in a single comment. i will try to answer it by showing, in detail, why the tech is sound. however this takes a bit of time to get right, bear with me.	2
i’ve been following this board for a while and wanted to clear up a few things and give my thoughts and try and explain why i think ripple and more specifically (xrp) has so much value. first, market cap… there seems to be a misunderstanding on what a market cap is when people try to comprehend its limits. there are 100 billion xrp in existence, and even though we go by circulation (38b) to calculate the market cap i’m speculating the future so i will use the 100b, also because its nice and round. if everyone holding xrp right now decided we weren’t going to sell an xrp for under $100, that would make the market cap 10 trillion usd. $1,000 would make it 100 trillion. this wouldn’t happen due to the way markets work, however its an easy explanation as to how a market cap is set. it doesn’t even remotely resemble how much money has been invested in it, but how much people are willing to pay for / sell it for. many people seem to have yet grasp this concept. now why does xrp have to be valuable? if ripple succeeds in taking over the swift system and handles the entire market of large volume cross boarder payments, the intrinsic value of xrp would have to be at the very least reflected in the market cap. cpss (committee on payment and settlement systems) participating countries. transfer around 8.4 trillion dollars a day. now is where i start to speculate. in my conservative estimated opinion, i would guess that financial institutions would want to keep at least one days worth of transfers in xrp in their systems (i could be wrong but i’m pretty smart so whatever roll with it). right now they have to hold a lot more money locked up because of the way the swift system works over 3-5 days to guarantee the transfer. the xrp has to at least reflect the amount they need for the transfers. banks can’t currently transfer $500 billion of xrp in the next few hours because its simply not valuable enough, there isn’t 500 billion dollars worth of xrp to transfer. by nature it has to be more valuable. assuming 1 days worth of 8.4t, would give 1 single xrp and intrinsic value of $84. and this would be if there were no investors in it and the banks held all of it. thats the minimum if xrp captured the entire market and the institutions held on to a days worth. just think about that. now if other types of payment services involved ripple and we accounted for investors holding it, and we also know that financial institutions may hold more than that, these prices could be well over that. do i think xrp will hit 200-300 in the next 5 years? probably not, however i have no idea thats not the point of this post. xrp is the only crypto that i have been able to at least narrow down on any sort of intrinsic value and that value to me is off the charts from where we are now. that’s why i, as you all say, hodl. edit: grammar, changed a sentence structure for clarification. edit 2: cpss participating countries* it's late and wrote this a little to quickly once i realized this account is over a week old	1
"at .29c - ""good time to buy?"" at .84c - ""good time to buy?"" at .70c - ""what the hell, you guys said to buy at .84c and now i'm down 16.6%!!"" at .95c - ""good time to buy?"" no matter what, asking a group of individuals who have vested interest whether it's a ""good time to buy"" is foolish on its own. asking others whether you should invest in something as volatile and new as these cryptos is even more foolish. research and relax. watch the market. put your ear to the ground and invest only what youre willing to lose. if youre confident in the asset, you should be confident it will grow. peace! edit: here's why i am ranting. when i first got into investing, i got into otc and pink stocks with aspirations of storing profits on pallets and sailing the 7 seas on my new tanker. i would read the various boards online and would get sucked into the hype. i spent thousands of my hard earned long investment profits on these ""promising"" micro cap stocks but neglected to form my own unbiased opinion. i was blinded by dreams. needless to say, i would invest in these stocks based off others opinions. and you know what? i always lost. instead of research, i relied on others to coax me into purchases and the fears of missing out. i lost a lot of money but learned a lesson. dont buy because youre told to; buy because you stand behind it. edit2: im not trying to discourage excitement and opportunity. i'm merely trying to be a voice of reason for those who may blindly follow a number (aka xrp value) without understanding the hurdles and/or potential this young alt-currency may experience. nothing worse than jumping on the bandwagon seconds before everyone jumps. you'll be left wondering why and could risk selling at a loss over emotion/fear and becoming sour towards ripple which could result in more missed opportunities down the road! edit3: if nothing else, this opened up a good discussion with both sides of the fence voicing their opinion. we are being civilized and i am getting to see the other side's views."	2
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/05/30/xrapid-tipping-point-reached/ are we at the tipping point for use of #xrp? the number of xrapid customers is growing. xcurrent is quickly replacing swift messaging, and ripple just signed two new banks onto ripplenet. in addition to news about ripple's progress, the xrp community is also busy this week, planning meetups for europe, as well as voting on a new xrp symbol starting one day from now. after reading the news over the last few days, i leave it to you to judge whether xrp has reached a level of unstoppable momentum. hope you enjoy the read! let me know what you think - please leave any feedback below. sincerely, -hodor	1

hello! i'm claire arthurs kart (@clairearthurs), the new 'head of community' at ripple and wanted to introduce myself to the community on reddit. i joined ripple last week and am still getting my feet wet, but i look forward to getting to know everyone and hearing your ideas for how we can build a strong community together. i've been investing in crypto and reading deeply since 2013. ripple, xrp and xrp ledger enthusiasts have built a really strong community already, and i admire the passion, intelligence and thoughtfulness of the conversation happening across twitter, xrpchat and of course, reddit. i'll be here to listen, act as a liaison between ripple and the community, etc. i became interested in crypto and blockchain technology while living in rural india and seeing first hand the negative effects of financial exclusion and outdated financial systems on the everyday lives of people. building a more financially inclusive future that allows broader groups of people to participate in a formalized economy is why i joined ripple and why i believe in the power of the technology. enough for now - can't wait to meet and chat with you all!	1
"so after i pitched the idea to my manager regarding how ripple could help save the company millions of dollars each year in currency exchange rates through inter-company invoices he pushed me to pitching again but this time to the cfo. the company i work for *which i won't name* has over 45,000 employees worldwide and is the industry leader for it's services as well as being on the dow jones and ftse 100, so this isn't a small company by any means. anyway, i pitched how the company could use xvia and furthermore xrp to save them a lot of money, how transaction times for settlement would be so much faster, currently when they settle an inter-country invoice it takes 9-10 working days. i also mentioned how the company has over $45 million sitting in foreign exchange accounts and through using ripple's products this money wouldn't need to be there, essentially freeing up $45 million to invest elsewhere in the business. to cut a story short, the cfo was impressed with ripple but as soon as i used the word ""cryptocurrency"" the immediate response was ""it's against our regulations to use such an unregulated token for settlement."" these massive corporate companies are just not interested in anything which isn't strictly regulated & controlled. regardless of how many millions it will save them. this furthermore supports my argument that the g20 not issuing more regulation for crypto's was a bad thing, especially for ripple. we **need** regulation, ripple's products are built into regulation, we need regulation to make the market more stable, to take out these anomalies that continue to dominate the media headlines and to show the outside world that cryptocurrency isn't all about the dark web, selling drugs and ico's making a quick buck from whitepapers. it's also important to note that i think most company boards are well aware of blockchain and what its able to do for their businesses but they're reluctant to get involved because of the lack of regulation. we need a systematic push for higher regulation and a decoupling from btc. once we have these things, adoption will increase 10x quicker than we're seeing right now."	1
one case people make against xrp is that banks aren't adopting xrp, but rather xcurrent. here are two analogies that will make you understand: cars first came out in the late 1800s. cars (digital assets / xrapid). were by far faster and more efficient than their imediate predecessor, horse pulled carriages (swift). however, for people to truly start adopting cars in the masses a system had to be laid down first, the highway network of the 1950s (xcurrent). at some point, banks will be foolish to keep using their horse drawn carriages while other banks are beating them with much faster cars. at the same time, banks wouldn't start to adopt the car until a solid network (xcurrent) is in place. just like many were likely skeptical to go drive the first cars out on the old dirt roads, banks are right now skeptical to go out and use digital assets in the framework of the old system. with xcurrent, ripple is right now laying down the framework (the highway) for banks to start using digital currencies. a point will come though where banks will have to also adopt xrp (the cars) for the same reason it would be foolish to go out in a horse drawn carriage on a highway. ripple's huge advantage over other digital assets is that they are making the highway system and so they also have the control over which car (digital asset) banks must choose, xrp. second analogy. napster came out in 1999. similar to most digital assets, it was a very decentralized network that the established industry, in this case the record industry, did not like. napster perhaps had grandiose visions of liberalizing music and large music companies falling down. at the same time, there wasn't instant adoption of mp3s by the record industry, although mp3s had many advantages over cds. apple came along, and became a bridge between these two extremes. with its apple store (xcurrent we could perhaps say), apple was able to get a lot of established music companies to release their songs in mp3 format. this then led to many in the public purchasing apple mp3 products (which we could think of like xrp). for us, xrp is the product that will bring profit, but xrp adoption will not happen without a bridge. likewise, many digital assets out there will not be adopted by established players because, as in the case of napster, there is no bridge between the two extremes. once this bridge is established, it is a natural result that the company's main product (mp3 hardware, smart phones, xrp) can profit from it. it is not a matter of if xrp will be used, it is a matter of when.	1
what are some of the strong features he should know about, and why would he care about getting in? also, don't you think [looq](https://looq.io) should include ripple in their future release?	2
when i first bought ripple at .2 all i thought was the price. $1, $2 $3 ect. but since this last correction i forget about the price and focus more on partnerships and the state of the currency.	1
first and foremost, welcome to r/ripple! we’re glad to have you here! it’s a very exciting time for ripple and we’re glad you’ve found us. while many of you will have many questions, it’s important that we keep this sub filled with discussion that is relevant to everyone. in the crypto space things can quickly become confusing and at times overwhelming, no worries, we have a great [beginner’s guide to ripple-xrp] (https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-do-i-buy-ripple-xrp-cryptocurrency/) wondering where to purchase xrp? [click here] (https://ripple.com/xrp/buy-xrp/) once again, we welcome all newcomers and ask that you please visit the linked guides before making a new post about wallets, exchanges, and other questions as to where to buy xrp. welcome to our community and happy trading!	2
of all the coins in the crypto market crashing today how many can boast a real use case, large partnerships and the ability to pass through regulations unscathed. xrp may be going down temporarily but when you look at the bigger picture it is a currency destined to be successful in the long run. look at altcoins like tronix and verge with very few use cases, unprofessional representatives doing webcam discussions from hotel rooms and almost nothing in the way of partnerships and then look at xrp; partnerships with some of the biggest names in international money transfering and banking, a clear defined use case that has been proven to work and a full team of experienced forward thinking directors and representatives working day in and out to push xrp forward. which of the coins mentioned above is most likely to succeed? i know who i would put my money on (in fact i have). the main issue we have at the moment is that xrp is heavily tied to btc and until we break away as a stand alone currency we will sadly have to endure this sort of volatility. that said we are definitely heading in the right direction for example the sbi announcement earlier in the week which i am pretty certain is the first of many. yes it is sad to see your portfolio shrink especially if you are not a day trader. hold strong though, xrp has one of the strongest foundations of any cryptocurrency, i think long term it would be hard for it to fail.	1

with the increased attention on xrp with these 40%+ price increases - we will inevitably bring new people asking what some would term ‘stupid questions’. some will be complete newbies to crypto, others will have been led to believe the fud train over xrp and are now trying to re-educate themselves about xrp. it is paramount that as a community we are as welcoming as we can be. i will put it out there now - if i see any ignorant, none welcome responses (even to the simplest of questions) i’m going to be downvoting your arse. i would hope everybody else do the same. we need to welcome these new folk into our community with open arms. no question is ever a stupid question if you don’t know the answer.	2
"a few months ago i made a post here after i pitched ripple and blockchain technology to cfo of the company i work for (ftse 100 company with 45,000 employees). as the business operates in the assurance and inspection industry, blockchain would be very useful to them to validate inspectors authenticity when they complete inspections of various products etc. they also handle massive inter-company and inter-country invoices, which require huge stacks of money to be put into foreign currency accounts for conversion. i identified xvia to be the best product ripple offer to help give them a solution and allow them to not have to hold all that money in those accounts, hence freeing up liquidity. well anyway, the feedback from my pitch a few months ago was that they wont touch anything with cryptocurrency involved however a recent communication i received from the board of directors was that they were in the process of introducing blockchain technology to validate inspectors authenticity when carrying out inspections. funny that huh. it just goes to show that the big players in industry are aware of blockchain technology, which is great for us but it also shows us that they understand the benefits it can bring to a business. i wouldn't be surprised in within the next year or two i see an email saying ""we will be using ripple for inter-company/inter-country invoice settlements."""	1

i've gathered some information from korean news / forums etc that's not readily available in the media. a lot of people don't seem to know what's going on either so just sharing outcome from my research. i'm made in korea, living in australia :p &nbsp; korean exchanges and banks (requiring accounts to be verified) &nbsp; korean investors can only trade from exchange that is linked to their banks.. for example korbit exchange - shinhan bank only coinone exchange - nong hyup bank only upbit exchange - gi-up bank only bithumb exchange - nong hyup, shinhan bank etc etc &nbsp; government and banks &nbsp; government (recently revealed that they are heavily invested in cypto), want banks to be held accountable for should there be any problems with crypto. i.e. even hacking of the exchange sites... so it is up to banks to decision, not exchanges. now i can't confirm if above bill was passed or not (probably won't) but seems like government wants to intimidate & manipulate banks while not officially announcing the ban. because if government bans crypto, come next election and they'll be out on the streets. &nbsp; korean exchanges that doesn't require account verification &nbsp; (so something like binance where no / minimal verification is in place) if these exchanges fail up signing contract with banks, they will closed. full stop. will banks signup with them? probably no. as they are minor exchanges and again, banks are to be responsible. such a bs. had my relative who tried to create a bank account to use in exchanges but failed. bank didn't accept new user / account creation for exchanges. don't ask me why, i don't know. afaik banks had plan to accept new users by the end of january. this has been delayed to early/mid february, think it was sometime around 6th or round about there (so soon)!! things could change thanks to all those corrupted korean government fools. best bet is to wait and see how things go, this manipulation won't last long. edit: i can't seem to paragraph correctly :(	1

to put into perspective how poorly coinbase has performed in recent times, here's the usd volume produced by just 1 xrp pair on binance (usdt) &#x200b; https://i.redd.it/m8jisrw7plo11.png here's coinbase's entire volume across all pairs: &#x200b; https://i.redd.it/1p1eq6m8plo11.png one xrp pair has produced almost 100% more volume than coinbase's entire volume. here are a few more xrp pairs that are producing more volume than coinbase: &#x200b; https://i.redd.it/i3a93la9plo11.png &#x200b; coinbase is being destroyed by competitors, which likely explains their announcement today. it seemed really desperate. who would've thought that ignoring your customers would result in a significant loss of market share? :) p.s guys, if you're wanting to buy xrp, try to avoid doing so through coinbase if possible. i know some of you can't depending on your region, but if you can, please support the exchanges that support xrp.	1
i've dove deeper down the rabbit hole that 7-bank lead me too. so to start, there is a lot of little banks and f.i's that sbi are the parent company of; 77, orix, iyo, and a lot more you've never heard of. but, some of these little banks are more than what they look like, 7-bank - owners of 7-11, aeon - heavily used service that travelers use to get yen on the spot, shinkin central bank - they hold alot of yen (they kind of act like a reserve in a way), sony bank - it is a direct bank so no branches or atm's 7-11's are already a go to place to pay for utility bills, phone bills, and others. these little convenience stores will serve as a 24/7 brick and mortar location for people to what ever financial service they need done. aeon, travelers use their atm's to exchange foreign currencies to yen on the spot. already located in airports around japan, perfect use case for xrapid. shinkin, not much info about it but, they play a key role in japaneses financial industry. sony bank, yes its associated with sony electronics. my best guess here is that this bank serves as part of sony's world wide payment infrastructure. you guys have been overlooking this for so long. sbi is literally behind so many financial institutions in japan, they pretty much have a monopoly on the money services there. with all of these banks operating under sbi, once sbi vc is launched and once sbi puts xrapid into production. we will moon. i encourage all of you to take a second and dig just a little deeper then you guys do. most people on here just listen to all the news that youtube, twitter, and reddit rehashes over and over again. there is plenty of info, buried out there, between the lines, or staring you in the fricking face that no one has talked about yet. theres bigger fish to fry than coinbase out there. sources: https://ripple.com/insights/forty-seven-japanese-banks-move-towards-commercial-phase-using-ripple/ http://rppl.info/	1
we’ve all heard brad’s clever, canned quip along the lines of “it would be much faster to fly cash from new york to london than to send money via swift.” given how ripple is on a viral marketing kick with ellen, madonna, donors choose, etc. - why don’t they actually do that? i’m picturing a video commercial where the point is a race to deliver money. someone leaves ripple’s ny office with a backpack full of cash, while someone else sends an electronic payment via swift to someone in london. first person to get the money to london wins. you show the person flying to london, delivering the cash, going on a short holiday (seeing the sights, etc), flying back to ny, while the swift money still hasn’t settled. part 2 of the commercial is the same race, but it’s physical delivery vs xrapid. basically the guy carrying cash doesn’t even get to the elevator before he’s lost the race. i think it would demonstrate brad’s quip in a funny, visual way. also, as someone from nyc i totally volunteer to be the guy who goes to london ;-) just trying to think of a fun way to help people/potential customers understand the benefits of xrp. what do you think of this idea? edit: title should say “it would be faster to fly...” don’t know why i wrote cheaper....	2

i have been following the crypto scene for a while now and finally decided to put a little money into ripple. i just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone here for all the helpful information you guys have posted and for always being willing to answer other people question no matter how silly or insignificant they may be. your hard work and generosity has not gone unnoticed. so to you i give a sincere thank you! happy holidays!	1
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/ripples-predictions-for-2018/ as much as ripple employees and executives try to steer clear of the prediction business, there's much that we can infer from company statements, interviews, blogs, and other reference material as 2018 begins. how does ripple see the crypto market? what are their plans? i cover their perspective and possible future scenarios in my blog, so you'll have to read it to find out. thanks & hope you enjoy! - hodor	1

"edit: a good way to show you what i mean is to look at the past month of ripple: https://imgur.com/zfdvctg edit: soo hopefully you all listened because it's already climbing back up! if you are new to ripple you probably got all excited about the price increase but are freaking out about the dip. i on the other hand am very excited about it! big dips are always followed by huge price surges. look at bitcoin or ethereum or litecoin. here's why ripple dipped.... 1) a lot of people set up automatic calls to sell ripple when it reached .29 and .30. so as it quickly climbed, it slowed down at this ""peak"" because lots of people wanted to sell. 2) now that the price has dropped, all these same people go in and buy more ripple. which means the price will rise again. 3) now that it's reached .30 before, you'll start seeing automatic sells at .35 or .40. which means soon we'll be hitting new highs again! 4) then guess what, it'll regroup after that as well. just imagine someone climbing a mountain. you don't just run to the top your first try. you climb a little, take a break, climb a little, etc. 5) but if you are smart and notice, all these prices are still continuing to go up overall. ripple was only worth $.18 less than a month ago!! if you look at the big picture ripple is climbing at an incredible rate. 6) anyways, just remember, majority of people try to sell high and buy low. we just saw ripple hit a recent high so people sold. now people are going to buy now that it's cheaper. and guess what, it's going to go up again. so be smart and ride the waves. 7) my favorite time to buy any currency is when there is panic and the graphs are all red and things look terrible. because then when they become green and happy i own way more currency and get to rub it in everyone's faces. but for real, if you are smart just keep buying ripple during the price dips and hold. in 2018 when it touches $1, you will have cared less about all these price dips and swings. invest in the idea of ripple, not in the arbitrary numbers you see on graphs with red and green lines. i too have made this mistake with other currencies when i first started, but now that i use logic and not emotion i've made a hell of a lot more money. edit: already looks like it's starting to regroup again. i hope you new people listened up!"	2
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/06/03/puzzle-pieces-fitting-together-ripple-xrp/ sometimes to see a larger picture, you need to take a step back and look at individual events in context. i do that in my newest blog, and the result is now sharpening into focus. yes, i cover all the recent crypto news impacting xrp and ripple as well, including the canadian hacking case, voting progress for the new xrp symbol, and exciting news about banking adoption. hope you enjoy the read! please leave any feedback below. sincerely, -hodor	1
as we all know, xrp has one of the most viable and progressed use cases of all coins. nothing can match it in terms of adoption and usability at this moment. however it also is seen as a joke by the wider crypto community, some of that comes from the ‘banker coin!!’ crowd, and they will never change their tune. but some of that comes from within our own community. for some reason, a small but vocal minority seem to think pushing conspiracy theories and fake news is good for their investment? there are a few individuals leading this childish mindset, samiam, jacktherippler, rachel lee to name a few. it all started with the bg123 crap back in q1 and has been spread since, causing the entire community to look like a bunch of nutjob children. the spreading of false hype has already caused wikipedia to cancel talks with coil, i’m sure plenty of investors have also fomo’d in based on rumours, none of this is positive for a community where expectations are constantly set sky high and routinely crushed. in future all this will lead to us angry investors and more fud from those who thought their $50 investment was going to get them a superyacht. i’ve mostly seen this stupid behaviour from kiddies or people with small investments who want hope that they will be multi millionaires, but it’s important for everyone in the community to do their bit and push back against false hype and conspiracy where they see it. manage expectations and ensure facts are the main driver, as they would be in any other asset class. take a look at yourself and where you source your news from, ensure your information is sound and check that you aren’t spreading anything that could cause others to make financial decisions based on rumours. help stomp out the crazy in this community, let’s ensure people are buying and interacting with xrp due to sound advice and solid facts. edit: i knew i would be getting downvotes for this. if the reality that we will not see any crazy high numbers in 2018 is too much for you then i apologise for breaking the news, either sell up or buy the dips, xrp is still a brilliant investment and you will likely see amazing returns in the short term (as we did just in september).	1
hi guys, ripple got now more than 200.000 followers @ twitter, lets all vote to get this baby listed @coinbase. they cant deny it anymore https://twitter.com/fubar601/status/932965726599745537	1
"making a separate post from a comment i made on another post. since i see many people being disappointed about the price action from after the xrapid announcement until now, asking what the difference now is if the volume doesn't increase from one day to another. my personal thoughts & perspective on it: 1. the price more than doubled running up to swell, outpacing any other cryptocurrency in september. 2. xrapid is now in production, which does not mean that from one day to the other millions of cross-border transactions are being handled through the system. it. takes. time. 3. the difference is, now it is a **fact** with testimonials from **actual customers**, that ripple's product suite **is working and delivering great results**. 4. being invested in xrp is not anymore a matter of ""let's see what comes out in the end"", it officially turned into a matter of ""this is here to stay, to grow, to become bigger and bigger and bigger"". personally, i couldn't be more happy. i am not afraid of this investment being a high-risk investment anymore (by my own risk assessment, own research and those news coming out). i am more sure than ever that this will pay off and that ripple is the right candidate to be a first mover towards the utilization of cryptocurrencies in the financial sector. any other coin i am holding (yes, all of them) is still for me considered as a lost investment. xrp is not anymore. **that is the difference.**"	1
this post is going to be blunt. as a disclosure, i only hold xrp. i am writing this because more and more, i am reading comments from people that need a reality check. ripple doesn't really care about speculators, nor should it. it's focus is banks and corporations, not us that want to become zillionaires off of ripples' coattails. more and more every day, i keep reading new comments from people upset with ripple because they aren't providing enough information causing the price of xrp to stagnate. the way i see it, that's the same as investing in the us dollar and hanging on every word of (insert huge us-based company here) and expecting the us dollar to gain strength. people are treating every word ripple says as gospel and are becoming deeply offended when something they don't agree with is mentioned. for example, in the ama asheesh mentions xrapid is hoping to be ready by the end of the year which everyone reacts as if asheesh murdered your families. news flash, ripple is a company looking out for themselves. i don't know how many of you are software developers but delays happen, especially when it needs to be perfect the first time. i get it, ripple is the first company to utilize xrp and thus the value of xrp currently depends on what they are doing. we now have codius, future xpring projects to look forward to as well as others i'm probably not caught up on. just because ripple is working with xrp, doesn't mean they owe you anything. take what they give you with grace and quit whining when you don't hear anything. this is the state of your investment in xrp. it will gain value when it is being utilized. not based on hype like it has been doing up until now. personally, i believe in xrp based on what it can do, and what ripple, coil and others bring to the table which i cannot say about any other coin out there. as you were.	1
me and my team have been in telecommunication business for more than a decade, we have created multiple turnkey telecom operators and now own one as well. my main business is international calls, at first it was calling cards, now as the technology has evolved we moved to apps which provide voip services to people who want to call abroad for cheaper prices. mostly these minutes are purchased from wholesale resellers who buy them from large nationwide telecom operators and resell them. long story short, i'm thinking about making a voip app for ios and android where people can use xrp to pay for the international calls. like skype out or viber out where instead of $ you pay with xrp. the second step will be to pay wholesalers with xrp, if we can achieve this, it would mean that instead of paying monthly we could be paying daily because of the super fast and super small transaction fees and this will let us get minutes much cheaper and to be more competitive on the market. if this method proves itself, it can be a signal to a whole 1.5 trillion dollar industry to get on board and you can imagine the impact it will have on ripple. at the moment technically we have everything ready, we could launch in 2 weeks. i'm thinking about it as a fun weekend project, if anyone has suggestions or wants to partner up just let me know.	1
so as everyone here knows we have seen a huge xrp pump just recently. thing happen for a reason. this is an insanely huge movement for the time period given the stagnant nature (not a bad thing, stability is good) of xrp the past months. recently miguel vias said this on twitter >crypto can be noisy and frustrating, even maddening at times, but it's filled with solid people. thank you @coinbase, for doing it right. so what do you guys think, will coinbase finally add xrp or no? they have been hinting at adding more coins, ripple seems like the best fit for the next coin. we are trying hard to promote ripple on twitter so we made a tweet showing of all this https://twitter.com/bitpams/status/940728460888215554 the [last ripple subreddit post we made about ripple and xrp being the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/7j5v5j/ripple_and_xrp_is_the_future_of_payments/) was successful and it seems people like positive words for ripple, so hopefully we can have a great end of year for ripple this christmas! 😊	2
total noob here, but to me it seems that most, if not all, crypto currency prices, including xrp at this moment, are mostly speculative. that is, the price goes up and down according to rumours and market movements based on the supply and demand balance of coins being sold and bought. **people basically buy and sell crypto currency coins just as if they were valuable vintage baseball cards, which hold value based on supply and demand, but with which you cannot actually do anything.** i mean, of all these crypto currencies, which ones are right now actually used for anything useful? that’s why xrp is relevant for me, and it’s the only crypto coin i invest in. **ripple are actually developing a platform and services around xrp, where said services actually make sense, and solve a real-world problem (fast and reliable international money transfer between banks and financial institutions without requiring to have money locked up in nostro/vostro accounts).** so to me, **whether the xrp price goes up or down 10% etc.. at this particular phase, is totally irrelevant, as xrp is, at the time being, is only being traded based on speculation.** i think the real value of xrp will manifest in the near future, once the ripple platform and tools will begin being used by banks and financial institutions. and that’s why i’m slowly buying and hodl:ing xrp :-)	1
i kind of glanced over the initial announcement as not big, but then saw this tweet, https://twitter.com/tonymission/status/979020934521802752 where he mentions just signing up and getting verified in 5 mins then was able to purchase xrp with debit card, would be nice if someone could verify, im broke so cant. though you cant deposit or withdraw xrp until phase 2 in the coming weeks, but at least you can buy direct with fiat as a us citizen not having to wait days or weeks or whatever to get verified, pretty much replaces the need for coinbase right? https://uphold.com/en/blog/posts/uphold/xrp-is-now-live-on-uphold	1
most of the time i find myself checking the price of xrp like every 30 seconds. that or i'm seeing what people are talking about on r/ripple. if i go to the store and buy something i think about how much xrp i'm spending. when i go out for a smoke and look up at the moon, i think of xrp. lately my dreams have been about xrp. also bought the domain xrpprice.ca but i don't even know what to put on it. anyone else feeling a bit obsessed with xrp?	1
i've been slowly accumulating with the ass ends of my packcheques since december and i'm finally sitting a little over 1k xrp. while my goal is 10k and i don't think i'll hit that before xrapid is switched on and we lose cheap prices forever. i'm very happy to have hit this milestone and i just wanted to say thanks to the community. i couldn't have done it without you. like honestly. when i've had questions they've been answered right away. in such a volitile uncertain investment that really helped me. #xrpthestandard	0

"any time anyone brings up a potential obstacle, drawback, or discussion regarding competition in this subreddit, it gets downvoted into the abyss. we need to start opening up to have healthy discussions in here, so we can all be better prepared to speak to arguments against ripple. this should be a knowledge sharing subreddit, but all i see are positive news posts and hyped up comments that are upvoted to the top. also, if we are opening up our discussions, this may help the ripple team understand some of the concerns from the general public and address them. not everything ""negative"" posted in this sub is going to push the price down, but i feel like people downvote posts just so it doesn't see any spotlight for this reason. it's not healthy."	1

title says it all. xrp is now breaking out into the forex market, and that can only mean big things ahead. &#x200b; xrp could be a base currency for forex trading, as well as a way for forex markets to settle between currencies. the xrpl could be used to trade between currencies in real time. forex exchanges could also utilize xrapid for settlement purposes.... deposit and withdraw xrp from fx choice. &#x200b; edit: i talked to customer service, and they stated that you can use xrp deposited for fx charts. for example if you take a short position on euro, you can get your profit in xrp! they also plan to add xrp for direct trading with other currencies. they have a live chat on the site.	1

"be very careful with what you guys are reading online. i have been pretty active in cryptos over the last few years and its sad the negative aspects of the stock market these coins and their communities are adopting: the pumping. i like ripple and i am a long term investor in the big three (btc, eth, xrp) but going over this sub reddit and seeing people back and forth just gives me flashbacks to all the people i knew who lost money from yahoo stock forums. especially given the low price and high float, xrp is relatable to a penny stock and its dangerous if you don't know what you are doing. don't listen to what people are saying, because most of the time it is people pumping to reassure themselves why ripple is such a great investment. we get it. its going to be huge, blah blah blah. i don't disagree, but please stop promoting it so hardcore forcing noobs to get in an lose their money. this is peoples real hard earned money and investing in anything is risky. stick to facts and share opinions, but don't tout why someone should get in now or ""how cheap it is"". so my advice is if you want to invest in ripple, buy, hold and don't look at your account for a few months or years until you gain the financial maturity to follow markets without impulse buying or selling. sorry if this comes off as unwarranted, as i haven't contributed much to this reddit or any other forum, but i had to say something."	2

cnbc interview with brad that happened earlier, he stated that they signed 20\- production contract in q1. no word on whether that was xcurrent / xrapid etc... but good news nonetheless! # xrpthestandard edit: [https://twitter.com/c3\_nik/status/1001881388608638977](https://twitter.com/c3_nik/status/1001881388608638977)	0
i noticed last night that kraken has added fiat pairs for cad and jpy. should help grow adoption and break the price tether to btc, assuming kraken can stay ahead of their stability issues.	1
"forget change.org petitions, this is reddit, home of the largest secret santa exchange on the planet. i searched this sub to see what people were doing and found nothing specific, only calls to do something. people are going into banks and telling them they should use ripple/xrp. i love the passion, even though that's not how banks make global transaction processing technology decisions. if we want the value of xrp to go up, we wait for ripple (they're doing a fine job). we also continue making it easier for others to buy xrp. now onto the details. if you are a coinbase customer and want to see xrp in that 4th slot, here's a step by step: 1. visit: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/emails/new 2. scroll down until you see ""contact our team"" (click it). 3. a submit a request will show up 4. choose other 5. choose your browser 6. subject: please add xrp ---- message: (whatever note you want, but here’s some text to get you started.) dear coinbase, i’m a customer and use your service often. i’d like to request that you add ripple - xrp to the buy/sell section of the website. i see that there is an open slot there next to litecoin. xrp belongs in that spot. faithfully yours, some person -------- 8. tweet them: hello @coinbase - i’m a customer and fan of your service. i would be an even bigger fan if you added $xrp to your buy/sell, it’s a perfect fit. @ripple"	0
ripple is now available on bitpanda, the biggest exchange in austria. verification needs only a couple of minutes and the site itself is really fast with a good ui. https://www.bitpanda.com/ i think this could be a huge boost for ripple, with an exchange platform being able to handle a huge user load.	1

"this subreddit has gotten an influx of wallet questions lately, so i thought i'd type up a quick beginners guide to ripple wallets. i'm going to start compiling an faq on the bottom of this post. *disclaimer: i am by no means an expert on the subject so do your own research and question everything, including the contents of this post. if you see clear errors on this post then please inform me via pm or in the comments, and i will make the necessary edits. this guide is for illustrative purposes only and i am in no way accountable for how you use this information.* **what is a ripple wallet?** what a ripple wallet basically boils down to is two lines of text, a wallet address and a secret key. these two randomly generated lines of text are all you need in order to have a ripple wallet and make transactions on the xrp blockchain. a ripple wallet can be generated in different ways, in general they are created by what ever wallet solution you end up using. before a ripple wallet can be used it must be activated, activation happens when 20xrp is deposited into the wallet address. that 20xrp will, until further notice, be kept in the wallet as a reserve, there is currently no way of getting that 20xrp out. however, the reserve used to 50xrp and will be adjusted in accordance to the value of xrp. the reserve is there to stop hackers from creating multiple wallets and spamming the network with malicious intent. for this reason you should try to avoid creating multiple wallets and instead import existing wallets if you're trying out different wallet apps. **what is a wallet address?** a wallet address is a unique identifier on the xrp ledger. what the xrp ledger is constantly doing is keeping a track of the contents of these addresses. when a transaction is made, the ledger simply reduces funds from one address and increases funds to the receiving address. you can check out this random address on a [ripple explorer](https://bithomp.com/explorer/rff1kqzna4y1kqzxccuo2lfrfrvbdrgdk4). feel free to test your own wallet out on it, if you don't find it trustworthy you can always use ripple's own [explorer](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/graph). a wallet address is public and sharing it online shouldn't be a problem, however, limiting your exposure online should always be a top priority and sharing a wallet address with significant funds on it is not a good idea if it can be tied to you or your online presence in anyway. **what is a secret key?** think of your secret key as a password and signature. when transferring funds from your ripple wallet, the xrp ledger will require proof of ownership before allowing funds to be reduced from the wallet. this is where the secret key comes in. your secret key can never be changed or customised^[**1**]. if someone has your secret key and your wallet address your funds can be emptied in an irreversible way. keep your secret key safe. if you are going to print it, make sure you keep it in a safe place and that the key doesn't imply its purpose in any way (ie. no mentions of ripple or xrp on it). don't store it in plain text files on your pc, at the very least open it in word and save the file as encrypted with a strong password. for more advanced encryption solutions, do a bit of googleing and find an appropriate solution, such as a fips approved encrypted usb drive. **what wallet should i use?** that all depends on what you plan to do with your xrp and how security oriented you are. i wont delve into specific applications on this post, i will simply talk about the 4 main wallet types: - hosted wallet: this type of wallet is basically holding your funds on an exchange. if you have to use a deposit tag to deposit funds on to your wallet then it is a hosted wallet. a hosted wallet is basically like a bank account on a bank, the physical funds are in a shared pool inside the exchange's actual wallet. the exchange simply keeps track of how much of the pool is your share. this wallet type is considered the riskiest of all, as the funds are out of your hands and all you have is an iou from the exchange. see part ""should i keep my holdings on an exchange?"". - software wallet: this is the most common type of wallet. it is basically a program on your device (pc, phone, tab..) that holds your wallet address and secret key. this program does the grunt work and communication with the blockchain. - hardware wallet: a hardware wallet in essence is a hardware encrypted flash storage device. the wallet address and secret key are encrypted in the device. they still require a software solution on a computer to do the communication with the ledger, however, the secret key is not stored on the computer. - cold storage: the most popular form of this is a paper wallet. as we learned earlier, all we need to have control of a wallet are the wallet address and secret key, and the wallet address can be generated from the secret key . in essence, a paper wallet is simply these two lines of text (with or without a qr code for quick import). for a more secure approach, these wallets can be generated in an offline environment. check out this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/7l123b/howto_paper_wallet_generate_deposit_withdraw/) by u/pepperew for a guide to creating one. **how does a transaction happen?** to keep things simple (mainly because i'm simple), a transaction is basically funds being reduced from one address and increased in another. if you have sent or received xrp, you can find a txid (transaction id) and delve deeper into it using ripple's [transaction viewer](https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/transactions/) below is an example of one such transaction where 1300xrp was sent across the xrp blockchain: description: this is a payment transaction. the payment is from rdsbeomae4fxwgqtjp9rs64qg9vditcdbv to rff1kqzna4y1kqzxccuo2lfrfrvbdrgdk4. it was instructed to deliver 1,300 xrp. transaction cost: sending this transaction consumed 0.06 xrp. affected ledger nodes: it affected 2 nodes in the ledger: modified nodes: it modified the accountroot node of rff1kqzna4y1kqzxccuo2lfrfrvbdrgdk4 balance increased by 1,300 from 2,400 to 3,700 xrp it modified the accountroot node of rdsbeomae4fxwgqtjp9rs64qg9vditcdbv balance reduced by 1,300.06 from 4,806,296.382347 to 4,804,996.322347 xrp **should i keep my holdings on an exchange?** in general, a good rule of thumb is to only keep what you need for daily trading on an exchange. your holdings on an exchange are on so called *hosted wallets*. while the xrp is held in the exchange's wallet, the amount you have on your exchange is there and designated to you. when you transfer funds into an exchange you will see a wallet address and a deposit tag, that deposit tag is your unique identifier. when holding funds in an exchange, what you basically have is an iou (i owe you) from the exchange, which on a normal day to day basis is good and valid. however, were the exchange to be hacked and have their wallets emptied, you would be left with nothing. also, were the exchange to simply go bankrupt, you would also be shit out of luck. when considering making your own wallet, remember that it will need to be activated with 20xrp and there's no way of getting that reserve out, you may want to think about taking the risk on an exchange if you don't have significant holdings. here's a link to [kraken's](https://bithomp.com/explorer/rlhzpsx6oxkzu2ql12khch8g8cnzv1rbjh) wallet. please browse the sidebar for specific wallet applications, you can also ask questions on here and i'm sure the fine users of this subreddit will be happy to help. ## **faq** **i already made a wallet on app a, can i move it to app b?** yes. as we learned earlier, all you need is the wallet address and secret key. for example, with toast wallet you simply add a wallet - add an existing address - input your address and secret key and voila! think of your wallet as being your email address and your wallet application as being the browser you use to access your email, just because you switched from firefox to chrome doesn't mean you need to make a new email address! **how do i transfer funds with a paper wallet?** you simply import the wallet address and secret key onto what ever wallet app you want to use. if you want to limit the exposure of the secret key to a device you can go to toast wallet's browser version, open it in incognito mode and perform your transactions with that. when you close the incognito session it will automatic delete all references to the wallet on the computer. this tip came from richard on the [toast wallet discord chat](https://discord.gg/rw8zedr), where you can ask toast wallet questions straight from the developers. **how do i restore my wallet?** regardless of your intial wallet application, as long as you have a secret key available you can restore your wallet on toast wallet. - go to toastwallet.com and install toast wallet (or use the browser version using google chrome) - open the application and hit *create a new wallet* - go through the wizard and follow the instructions. create a strong passphrase, the passphrase and pin are the only things protecting your wallet, if the wallet backup were to get in the hands of a malicious person. - hit ""restore existing wallet"" - enter your secret key and give the wallet a nickname - create a backup of your wallet. this backup is encrypted and safe to keep in plain text form. **[1]** - turns out a secret key can be changed but is a very advanced method."	1
here’s something from an old guy to the young’uns new to investing. one undercurrent that i keep hearing in all of the talk of timing is “when/should i sell?” there seems to be a mindset that you have to sell all at once. of course you don’t. selling just some and keeping the bulk is often a better strategy. instead of thinking “i’ll sell at 10/25/100/whatever”, start thinking “if it hits 25/50/whatever, i’ll move x% to this other thing.” think in partials. this has worked well for me in the past. oh, and get off my lawn.	1
*edit: just to clarify, these prices are from coinmarketcap.com, which is an aggregate across all exchanges and the standard de facto price that most people refer to when they refer to a coin's price.* ----- i'm not going around saying that xrp does not need coinbase, but i respect the opinions of those that do. i personally think that coinbase would be really great for xrp. in the long term, xrp might actually need coinbase to continue its growth. but for now, xrp is showing great resilience in the wake of a lot of fud to have rebounded so quickly from that announcement. also to be fair, xrp was already in thr middle of a dip when coinbase posted that on their twitter so if anything, it should have aggravated the dip if xrp wasn't so resilient. so yeah anyone worried has gotta chill.	1
heard about, and got into crypto currency on dec 7th this year. effectively causing me to not study for any finals, because i wanted to get my accounts set up. after begging my family and everyone for early christmas money i got $800. i started by investing in litecoin, by dec 20th i had 3,000xpr, and i plan on holding for a long term investment, and pulling out enough to pay off my college on the side!	1
rip paypal / december 1998 - april 2018 &gt;we’re changing the balance functionality for your paypal account depending on whether we have been able to verify identifying information that you provide to us. &gt;if we have not verified your identifying information, a balance in your paypal account can generally only be held in your paypal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card. &gt;if we have verified your identifying information, a balance in your paypal account can be held in your paypal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others. &gt;we’re removing the variable rate pricing for sending money to friends and family members who have paypal accounts in a country other than the united states when you send money using paypal balance or your bank account and introducing a new flat fee of $2.99 or $4.99 per transaction depending on the recipient’s country. however, when you send money using your credit card, debit card, or paypal credit you will be charged the new flat fee per transaction depending on the recipient’s country + 2.9% of the transaction amount + a fixed fee based on the currency. https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full &gt;our updated privacy policy will be effective on april 19, 2018 no more stealth accounts, no more unverified accounts, no more paypal balance. basically, you're limited to one account, and one account only. sending money to family members is now [more expensive](https://i.imgur.com/9wayoaj.png) than using btc. tomorrow will be a sad day, but great for the future of cryptocurrency!	1

cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially not only in price this past year but also in public awareness and popular attention. the novel feeling to an emerging financial and technological market is reminiscent of the rise of the internet with its innovative potential. in turn, a heightened collective societal awareness of this new innovative potential has led to a change in the nature of the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. as heisenberg’s uncertainty principle posits, “the observation of a phenomenon changes the phenomena itself.” the observation of thousands of young millennials, and now middle-aged investors, will only accelerate the rise of cryptocurrencies as times goes on. today, we are seeing the real-world effects of a newfound intrigue into cryptocurrencies. this new interest is causing a narrowing of the divergence between truth and fiction over accurate knowledge about cryptocurrencies. the force drawing this gap narrower each day is an increased dissemination of truthful information that has generated legions of individual investors into new cryptocurrency markets; in particular, ripple’s xrp. as the public expands its understanding of ripple’s xrp, the capital inflow from both individual and institutional investors combined will likely grow to levels that will exponentially grow the liquidity of xrp and, as a byproduct, its price. here, in this report, i will provide an overview and analysis of ripple’s xrp and the implications q4 2017 and the year 2018 and beyond hold for the future of xrp and its price. **the concept: what is xrp?** xrp is the digital asset used by ripple to offer financial institutions an option for liquidity to conduct cross-border payments. it is predominantly used for ripple’s solution for the minimization of liquidity costs. in contrast to most other cryptocurrencies, xrp’s application here features a real-world applicability that extends to real-world transactions. it is used for the xrapid solution provided by ripple, and is the only one of the three solutions ripple offers (the others are xcurrent and xvia) that employs the use of xrp. **the rationale: why xrp?** there is a myriad of factors that distinguish xrp from other cryptocurrencies and establish it as a forerunner to what may become the dominant cryptocurrencies in the years that lie ahead. cost: comparatively, xrp has the lowest cost per transaction at $0.0004. in contrast, bch is $0.26, ltc is $0.37, dash is $0.64, eth is $0.96, and btc is $28.23. scalability: xrp can handle over 1,500 transactions per second whereas bch can handle 24 per second, ltc can handle 56 per second, dash can handle 10 per second, eth can handle 16 per second, and btc can handle 24 per second. speed: xrp can conduct transactions at a rate of 3 seconds per transaction, bch at a rate of 58 minutes per transaction, ltc at 17 minutes per transaction, dash at 15 minutes per transaction, eth at 2 minutes per transaction, and btc 1 hour and 6 minutes per transaction. xrp’s availability is ever-expanding. it is currently available on over 50 exchanges including bitstamp, bithumb, bittrex, binance, bitfinex, kraken, and poloniex. the volume of xrp availability is, in addition, in an expansionary phase. the primary location of exchange volume is concentrated in asia; in particular, south korea. however, as mainstream media attention increases, so will american interest as well. there already have been tell-tale signs indicative in news outlets that have covered ripple recently in the wake of xrp’s rise in cnbc, bloomberg, forbes, investopedia, and yahoo finance. simply consider the mania generated by the media attention to bitcoin. repetitive news stories featured on cnbc, bloomberg, cnn, cbs, and other mainstream media news outlets. countless articles disparaging it as a bubble and hailing it as a force that could deconstruct the financial apparatus governed by the federal reserve and other central banks. now, consider the results of media attention directed towards the substantive information behind xrp. once news segments and articles are shown and written that illustrate the comparative superiority of xrp to other cryptocurrencies, then the viewers and readers will likely flock to xrp in pursuit of acquiring a tried, tested, and proven cryptocurrency with real-world usage. in turn, a virtuous circle intensifying capital inflow to xrp is predictable and probably to occur. we can expect fomo to rise and a number of oscillations up and down for the price to unfold. nevertheless, the price of xrp is bound to not only remain but rather accelerate its demonstrated upwards price trajectory pushing us to new heights. additionally, if the collective fear among cryptocurrency investors materializes, that is, if new regulations are imposed on our activities, then ripple is stand to likely gain. dr. nassim nicholas taleb, a scholar and risk analyst writes about a concept called “antifragility.” antifragility is a term used to describe things that gain from disorder. considering ripple’s ties to financial institutions and regulators, it wouldn’t be too far-off to speculate that xrp is positioned to gain if such a black swan event were to occur. **further reasons to advance the case for xrp:** financial institutions, renown investors, and accomplished financiers have already taken notice of xrp. former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke has advocated on ripple’s behalf. zoe cruz, former president for institutional securities and wealth management at morgan stanley and former global head of fixed income, commodities, and foreign exchange has joined ripple’s board of directors. she has been named to forbes list of most powerful women for three years straight. perhaps most notably, a consortium of 61 banks – organized by sbi ripple asia – will be adopting ripple’s technology to settle transactions between its members with the eventual goal of applying xrp to usage. mr. yoshitaka kitao, the ceo, executive chairman, and president has publicly stated, “forget about bitcoin, we’re all in on xrp!” in fact, sbi has already confirmed that xrp will be put in usage in spring 2018. if successful, expect the price to reflect it. moreover, techcrunch founder michael arrington has, as of november 2017, announced a $100 million xrp hedge fund. his efforts have already raised $50 million which will engender a ripple effect of new large net-worth individual and institutional investors. the entity will be called arrington xrp capital and new information about its activities are set to be released in the months that lie ahead. also, david schwartz, ripple’s chief cryptographer, has said that there are two major “household” companies (not financial institutions) that will be announced in q4. this is likely to provide a substantial boon to xrp. finally, the chief technology officer of ripple, stefan thomas, has said that in 2018 there will be a “big push on xrp.” for years, ripple has kept a relative silence in expressing the superiority of xrp. 2018 will be different. 2018 is bound to be ripple’s year. **i expect the price to rise as high as $10** and as low as $4. at any rate, this report only scratches the surface of ripple and xrp’s potential. for far more nuanced and in-depth analysis and information, i suggest reading from ripple firsthand at www.ripple.com and perusing the best blog on xrp itself at https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/ to the moon, we go. source: https://cellardoorway.com/2017/12/24/the-case-for-ripples-xrp-a-brief-overview/	1

https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/01/15/xrp-by-the-numbers-2018-benchmarks/ every once in a while, it's good for crypto investors to take stock of their investments and where they're at in terms of liquidity and adoption. today is that day, and i'm taking a look at the same numbers that we discussed just three months ago. headlines: liquidity is massive. the number of wallets doubled. to find out more, you'll have to read for yourself! hope you enjoy the read & please let me know what you think; i'll make an effort to reply to all first-level comments. thank you, - hodor!	1
ripple created a digital asset called xrp, the intention was to create an asset that could be transacted more efficiently than current global payment systems are able to do. xrp settles all payments in 4 seconds, for 0.00001 xrp (0.03c), and is far more energy efficient than the current system. xrp is transacted through the blockchain but is private and has a 0% error rate. but none of that really matters. xrp just the asset, and like all assets, it holds value. right now, the market value of 1 xrp is 0.2943c. let’s break down what the company ripple is doing. ripple has three major projects xvia, xcurrent and xrapid. xcurrent is an end-to-end tracking and messaging system that allows banks to communicate in real-time. this is an automated process that ensures all payments are properly tracked and accounted for. xrapid is the program that uses xrp, when banks want to send global payments xrapid sources liquidity from xrp in the first market (aud) and then sells the xrp in the new market (usd). this lowers the cost of the transaction, increases the speed and reduces the risk of holding some currencies. xvia, this software is what brings it all together. xvia acts like a plugin on chrome. all you have to do is install it. the chrome interface is the same and you didn’t have to retrain or learn anything new, but you have the added functionality. today, ripples’ global head of strategic accounts marcus treacher announced that ripple has signed over 100 production contracts. meaning that over 100 banks/finical institutions are or will use ripple technology. some customers include mufg, santander, westpac & american express. earlier this year ripples cto left and founded coil. coil pays content creators like youtubers, authors and bloggers for the time people spend viewing the content. right now, it is hard to for independent content creators to earn an income from their work, but coil solves this. coil uses xrp to pay content creators as regular payment solutions would make it uneconomical. the programs that use xrp (xrapid and coil) haven’t been launched yet but are expected to later this year q3 – q4. on october 1st, 2018 ripple is hosting an event called swell and it “brings together leaders in banking and blockchain who are committed to changing the way the world moves money today”. swell is going to be massive. here are some of the key speakers at swell (an event run by, and about ripple) • president bill clinton • gene sperling · national economic council director and national economic advisor · (1996-2001, 2011-2014 • ed metzger · head of innovation at banco santander §  banco santander is the ninth-largest financial service company • richard teng • ceo of abu dhabi global markets those are just the people speaking the event is going to be packed with the world’s wealthiest and influential people in the financial sector. so why do i care about this? the price of xrp like most assets is determined by demand. when more people want it, the price goes up. during the last cryptocurrency explosion, ripple reached above $3 per xrp if someone had bought 1000 xrp for $300 they would have made a profit of around $2700. $2700 is a lot of money but why didn’t it go higher? here are 3 reasons reason 1: there wasn’t enough liquidity in the market. there simply weren’t enough platforms that allowed users to buy and sell. brokers had to close registrations because they couldn’t handle the capacity. since january 2018 dozens of trading platforms and wallets have been launched. (capital is not investing like that into collapsing markets) reason 2: the price of xrp has been/is tied to the price of bitcoin. this is because bitcoin has a 54% dominance over other cryptocurrencies. meaning the market value of bitcoin is 54% higher than the rest of the market combined. therefore, when the sentiment of bitcoin falls, and people sell (decreasing demand) the demand for xrp also falls. xrp is no longer ‘just another cryptocurrency’. this kind of innovation and implementation is unlike anything else in the space. xrp is about to completely blow up in value and it’s only a matter of time. reason 3: there wasn’t a strong proof of concept. the technology was their but no one new how it was going to be used or what to do with it. people wanted to buy xrp for the value, but there was no value without utilisation of the coin. this is solved with the development of xrapid and coil. i wouldn’t give you investment advice because nothing is a guarantee and the price of xrp could go to 0 but if you want to know anything more about it or want help investing let me know. it’s impossible to predict how high the price of xrp is going to go but predictions range anywhere from $8 to $589 but most point to a \~$50 price. if you invested $100 and the price went to • $8 \~ $2600 • $50 \~ $16 600 • $580 \~ $193 300 if you invest $500 and the price went to • $8 \~ $13 300 • $50 \~ $83 300 • $580 \~ $966 600 would this be good to send to my parents? they know about ripple from the appearance on ellen so i decided to follow up and educated them on it. how many of you are trying to spread the word? edit: 1. ripple didn’t make xrp... that’s embarrassing. it’s strange how much of the xrp community believes that they did. 2. price predictions are dumb	2
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/greed-fear-and-xrp-crypto-is-transforming/ crypto has lost its way recently; i talk about the effects of new investment money, the current state of crypto, sbi's plans, and how crypto should change if it's to avoid the ire of world governments. of course i also throw in my prediction for 2018 about these trends. hope you enjoy! please leave any feedback below & i'll try to respond to each one. thanks, - hodor	1
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/the-rise-of-fundamental-investing-in-crypto-what-it-means-for-xrp/ today's blog discusses technical analysis' current dominance of crypto markets; but it's also where i make a startling prediction. i predict that fundamental analysis will eventually rule the day in the crypto markets; i talk about which factors that individual investors should consider when evaluating crypto choices, and then point out where xrp stands in the mix. in crypto, it may be buyer beware, but investors have the ability to reduce their risk by conducting a proper analysis of choices. hope you enjoy the read - please leave any feedback below. thanks, -hodor	1
this latest dip might have you feeling a little shaky, but here's some perspective. if we look at the two other run-ups in 2017, it comes out to something like this (i am using the bitstamp chart): 1st run up: 0.5 cents to 6.9 cents, up 13.8x 1st crash: 6.9 cents to 3.2 cents, down 53% 2nd run up: 3.2 cents to 39.8 cents, up 12.4x 2nd crash: 39.8 cents to 12.7 cents, down 68% latest run up: about 23 cents to 331 cents, up 14.4x latest crash: 331 cents to ??? a crash of 68%, like the 2nd one last year, would set the price at $1.05. but, in a few months, we might very well have another 13x run up and be sitting at $13, and any hodlr will be really happy! so if you're new here, don't panic, this is crypto, crazy is the new normal!! edit: typo	2
just thinking aloud here. to begin with, i am not worried about the current xrp value dip. as i mentioned in my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/8q7w7z/imho_xrp_price_is_totally_irrelevant_until_real/), i think the current xrp value is purely speculative, so i'm not worried about that. i'm just waiting for when the current dip reverses, and then i'll buy some more xrp on it's way up. having that said, i am a bit worried. because the way i see it, the future is looking very bright for rapid and xrp. almost too bright. so i must be missing something. because when things look too good to be true, they probably are. so in the back of my head i'm thinking, what am i missing? what could go wrong? could ripple fail catastrophically due to some unforeseen upcoming regulations? could a potential sec ruling of xrp being a security void the usage of xrp as a utility token? something like that? i'm trying to see the grim alternatives here. but it is difficult, as we in the ripple community are kind of echo chamber positive about xrp. so i'm trying to see beyond that.. so i was thinking.. maybe we all could put our critical thinking caps on, and try to envision what setbacks could arise ahead, and then, for each of them, discuss the probabilities of them happening, and their consequences. i think it would be sane, to have that kind of constructive criticism discussion.	1
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/review-of-the-q4-xrp-report/ being a change agent for banking is unforgiving work. luckily for us, ripple is more than up to the task. in my review of the quarter 4, 2017 xrp markets report, i review the effect of recent negative publicity, as well as remind xrp investors about some key considerations that they should remember when seeing resistance to the change that ripple - and xrp - represents. and of course, we will look at miguel's quarterly xrp report to see some surprising numbers for ripple. spoiler alert: ripple made as much money in one quarter than they did for an entire year. i'm not giving it all away, however, so you'll have to read my blog to find out more. i hope you enjoy the read! thanks, -hodor	1
when i first began investing in crypto i didn't understand much of anything other than a tip i got from a friend to quickly go buy some bitcoin. i decided to branch out into alts and actually do my research and learn about what i wanted to put my money into. the one cryptocurrency that made the most sense to me was xrp. but when i'd come in here or go around the web all i'd see was fud. shitcoin. scamcoin. it'll never hit $1. it'll never be worth more than $0.24. the only person i could find singing xrp's praises out there was hodor on his blog and here on reddit. it was his analysis that led me to buy and to keep buying and to never sell. and i don't think i'm alone. seeing xrp hit $2 today was an emotional thing for me because i trusted my gut, i did my research, i read the white papers, researched the team and i could not have done any of that without hodor's contribution to this ripple community. thank you hodor, whoever you are, for taking the time, patience and effort to educate people about ripple. i hope all of the good karma you put out there with your efforts comes back to you times a triillion. ripple's a great company, with strong leadership and a sensational product, but hodor was their ace in the hole when timid newbie investors like me were wrestling with all the fud going on in here and on the internet in the early parts of last year.	1
i find it funny that these forums go shitface crazy over any mention of coinbase \+ xrp and something like sbi crypto exchange launch that is scheduled for this summer doesn't even get mentioned in a week. **do people even realize what kind of effin earthquake it will cause? or they didn't even hear about sbi ?** coinbase is like puppy compared to beast that sbi is planning to release out.... i also often go over to xrpchat and people there for long time are aware of what is comming... is reddit that slow ?.... if that is the case, i recommend many of the r/ripple users to check on xrpchat sometimes ;\) https://i.redd.it/v96wu295b1v01.jpg i know that people can get excited about snoop dogg , bud if you care about your investments \- this is the news you should be excited for.	2
just a little christmas story.. dates back to at least 7 to 8 years ago, my father and i have never saw eye to eye. just two completely different people, and it’s been a hard slug to forge some type of relationship. in general he’s not a happy man, for what particular reason i don’t know. i mean don’t get me wrong it’s got better in past years. now ripple comes into the story.. about the start of year i was looking to invest into a start up, in search for the millions. i started looking into ripple and as somebody who works within financial infrastructure the benefits were instantly clear. they have cleverly identified a problem that has and is facing most financial institutions in the world. in my personal belief, they have the answer in the ripplenet ecosystem. anyways, my dad has always worked hard with really very little return(like 99.00% of the population) but has always saved and wanted to invest in something, but to be frank 2017 scares him, he’s so old school(what’s great in my personal opinion) you won’t find him on facebook! so we talked about it, i put together a research pack for him on ripple and we took the dive together at a very handsome price compared to $1 :d last friday and this morning he has woken me up with joy written across he’s face, i haven’t seen him this happy in years! personally i don’t think it’s the increase in $$ it’s the fact we have something to share, something to discuss and it feels good! so merry christmas all and happy one dollar!	1
on an australian forum i am apart of we have had users reporting they are able to buy xrp using coinjar right now. on further investigation it seems it is early access for some users only (although i am not sure how they are selected) but it is definitely happening. https://support.coinjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005901226-supported-digital-currencies i don't think coinjar is as big as coinbase but still excellent news nonetheless!	1
honestly, this is kind of hilarious. coinbase snubs ripple/xrp and most of the crypto community is either delighted or down right nasty about the announcement. some xrp hodlers are up in arms as well. meanwhile... ripple’s svp of products indicated they’ve either captured or are working on capturing at least 50% of india’s financial/remittance markets. a nation of 1.3 billion people. india is striving to digitize their currency 100%. they’ve literally burned some of their paper fiat to hasten the transformation. the vision is for everyone to have a smart phone which can allow for complete digitalization. ripple, in their ‘delusional’ wisdom, has approached the telecom companies so that ripplenet is akin to being standard on these smartphones. india, who has been downright hostile to reluctantly tolerant of crypto currency in general, has not impeded ripple’s efforts to bring half of the country’s banking and day-to-day commerce to ripplenet. this is happening. to some degree this will be successful, perhaps entirely. hardly a word about this in the other subs. it’s mostly cb excitement and hype and xrp slander. it’s analogous to kids celebrating their neighborhood stickball victory while ripple packs their bags for spring training.	2
"1: **xrp is a speculative purchase.** this is not a bad thing or a good thing, it just is. nobody's really using it. i think they will someday. therefore the price is not dictated by supply and demand. certainly, speculative purchases create what demand there is, but that's not need-to-use industry demand. this is why ""good news doesn't move the price"" or even ""drops"" the price, because the price isn't usually moving rationally based on news. we all secretly know there are literally zero customers who have an innate need to purchase xrp to survive or compete - yet. so we're all in the same speculative boat trying to sell to each other. 2: if and when industry demand fires up, **xrp price will be dictated chiefly by industry usage, and not just speculation.** 3: **industry adoption will presumably start with smaller remittance institutions.** people are acting like ripple admitting that the big banks aren't target#1 is a bad thing. that's a good thing. the big banks are already making money. the smaller guys doing international remittance need to make ends meet. they need xrp. 4: **we're not going to decouple from bitcoin until industry is driving price.** no need to ask or request roadmaps on how we'll decouple. right now both bitcoin and xrp and nearly every other coin are just free-floating in a speculative market, so there's no reason not to swap freely between them. as soon as one price moves, bots swiftly move in to profit off of the spread. as soon as xrp goes up or down compared to btc/usd/usdt/eth/whatever, the bots probably sell to reap the fractions-of-a-cent difference, which buffers whatever difference there is between coins within minutes to hours. 5: **whales?** yeah they're manipulating price right now but they're doing so in that free-floating context of a purely speculative market. once industry drives demand, whales will be btfo of the water, i assume; or they'll have to pursue other speculative coin markets, assuming that's still profitable in a post-blockchain-adoption world; or they'll become liquidity providers for the xrapid network, should that be profitable enough. 6: **this is gonna get downvoted as fud**, but i don't think it qualifies. there's no fear, uncertainty, or doubt in my mind here. if anything all of this, and ripple's tweets and statements to this effect, solidify in my mind that this is a real project that stands a real chance of adoption, which means: 7: **the time to accumulate xrp is this year.**"	2
so i am making this thread so we can talk about how to withdraw large amounts of xrp, a lot of people seem to be unsure of how to do this (including me) and it would be nice to get some of your guys opinions, also if anyone knows how much taxes would need to be payed, or ways of avoiding taxes (legally) that would be great.	1
"every previous guest had it's piece, then they just dropped talking with brad, because other ""breaking"" news took air time. hilarious. almost like someone wants to manipulate and just ignore certain cryptocurrency. and so disrespectful, i feel bad for brad. ok, i have to be more precise: i don't mean it's a conspiracy, but looks really dubious and unprofessional."	1
this is the primary criticism of the many xrp naysayers and main point of the bloomberg article. and lets face it, banks aren't going to have anything to do with cryptos unless there are clear regulatory guidelines from central banks. bank's don't want to come out looking irresponsible. and ripple obviously know this. which is why they are focusing on payment providers for now like moneygram, western union, mercury fx etc. if you can catch the low hanging fruits and show cost savings. it becomes easier for banks to see value and evaluate risks and push for positive regulation. and every central bank is looking at regulating cryptos. so sooner or later there will be regulations. and when that happen's xrp will be available for use. ready and tested. to declare banks 'don't want the currency' at this point of time and therefore xrp is worthless is irresponsible journalism and clumsy analysis. what ripple has is potential that few or none of the other coins currently exhibit. so i'd still say it is better to get in early while it is still cheap!	0
bitcoin has its pizza day. on july 10, 2015, the first significant use of xrp in a transaction - the purchase of jet fuel - took place. 850,000 xrp was used to buy a full tank of jet fuel for a trans-atlantic flight. at the time, the fill up was worth about $7,380. today, the same amount of xrp is worth $400,000. the event was duly noted here on r/ripple, but the community wasn't what it is now, and the anniversary came and went without mention. let's take this opportunity to celebrate this event today and remember it for posterity! original link: https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/57fesb/ripple_jet_fuel_day_july_11th/	1
"if you think xrp and ripple are crap, sell your coins. there are tons of other crypto's out there that will happily take your money and offer you the same exact risk or much more risk than xrp. angry at ripple that you missed the opportunity to make money elsewhere by holding xrp? that's your fault. if you knew stellar and iota were going to go up like this and you didn't sell all of your xrp to go get in on that then you need to really need to ask yourself why you're investing in crypto. if any of us knew other coins were going to ""lambo moon mommy"" we'd all have jumped into them. once you have xrp on an exchange it's not that difficult to swap for any of them. i can go turn my whole stack of xrp into xlm in minutes if i want to. i don't want to. you're pissed because you missed out. admit it. you didn't miss out because ripple fooled you. ripple didn't do anything to you. ripple stayed stable. you chose not to invest in the other coins. you did that. again, deal with that choice. know why i think you're mad? because you bought xrp because it was cheap and it was the one you could buy hundreds of or thousands of and you thought you'd own hawaii by now. and ""by now"" i mean in the past 5 months. that's realistic. screw you ripple! i don't own hawaii yet. wahhh! you're so mad you want to come in here and spread fud because ""you no lambo moon""? stop wasting your time and our time. you have nothing to add to the conversation and should put your money into the magic bean coin you knew was going to pop 1000%. again, why'd you stay with xrp if you knew the other coins were ready for ridiculous run-ups? loyalty? who are you, hodor? if you're an investor just out for instant profit, then be that. here's what i know. amex. hedge fund. gates foundation. sbi. japan. india. lockup. there's more. it's pointless to list the reasons why to you because ""you no lambo moon"". i make you no promises what the value will be. i'm not an expert. i have expectations though and if they are not met, i'll move on someday. like a rational investor. today's not that day for me. but since so many people seem to have ""missed out"" because they bought xrp, i encourage them to stop holding and move on to something else. i'll happily keep buying up your coins for 22 cents until i can't anymore. and if this comes off harsh, it was meant to. when i see what people are tweeting back at ripple, brad and joel katz i'm embarrassed for you. those guys are working hard to make xrp vital. i hope they succeed. crypto isn't an entitlement. if you feel you're entitled to the gains the early buyers of btc and eth have gotten you should have been one of the early buyers of btc and eth. the cat's out of the bag now. everyone knows about crypto. i fully believe when they learn more, they'll choose to buy xrp and drive the price right up."	0
to start off i've been into crypto since mid 2017. i purchase my crypto, usually btc, through coinbase pro to avoid fees. one of the traders i follow on twitter mentioned when they transfer from one exchange to another they do so with xrp. so i figured i'd try it out to see how fast i could move funds from one exchange to another. i bought $50 in xrp on coinbase pro and moved it to kraken where i do my day trading. i expected a few minutes at least but i clicked withdrawl and by the time i click my kraken browser and hit refresh my funds had moved for a fee of a whopping $0.00 i usually rip on the blind faith following that xrp has but now i understand why it has it. i'll never transfer from exchange - exchange with anything other than xrp again. edit: thanks for the gold! my first gold. edit 2: thanks for the platinum! another first.	1
"even as little as six months ago i saw an article about how netflix was going to fail. in fact all throughout it's rise i remember constantly seeing articles spreading doubt. ""can netflix sustain its business model?"" ""netflix new decisions, will this bring them down?"" etc etc and on and on it went, year after year while netflix continued to grow. same thing happened with amazon before that. rarely did you see articles proclaiming how great it was going to be. the whole time it was growing nothing but doubt being tossed on it and questions if it could last or when the whole thing would come crashing down. ripple/xrp suffers an even worse problem. it is attacked on two fronts. on one hand it is a threat to the big central banks/swift. on the other hand it is a threat to bitcoin and the philosophy behind it. so xrp is under siege from without and within its own community. it's almost like a centrist politician. those on the left find him too conservative, those on the right find him too liberal. but it means ripple/xrp is right on track. no one would care to write up blatant lies and fud if they didn't see xrp as a threat. hold tight, xrp's enemies can see the writing on the wall."	1

"so, let me get this straight... in 2004, ryan fugger got this idea of creating a global decentralized monetary system that could allow individuals/communities to create their own money. this led to the creation of ripplepay.com (2005). - this was even before the release of the legendary bitcoin whitepaper by satoshi nakamoto, which was in 2008. fast forwarding to 2011 : jed mccaleb, arthur britto and david schwartz get together, foresees the problems bitcoin is going to face in the future (i.e. now), and starts developing a digital currency (xrp) which is faster, cheaper and more energy efficient than bitcoin. 2012 : chris larsen joins the team. they approach ryan fugger, after long discussions, who handed over the reins. thus, opencoin was founded. 2013 : opencoin becomes ripple labs. 2014 : ripple, seeing the massive potential of blockchain technology, proposed codius. codius is a project to develop a new smart contract system. ripple sort of benched codius to focus on international remittances. - ethereum was proposed late 2013 and went live in 2015. ripple's vision of ""not one, but many blockchains"" led to the creation of the interledger protocol which lets different blockchains and networks interoperate. 2018 : codius is back! stefan thomas (inventor of the interledger protocol) steps down as cto of ripple and launches his project coil, which aims to allow micropayments for content management. it will be using interledger protocol, and carry xrp tokens for monetization. my point is : ripple is building a completely game changing ecosystem. how ? well, they took on the top 2 cryptocurrencies.... [- bitcoin focussed on being a global currency. but xrp can, right now, do everything bitcoin can wayyy better. - ethereum focussed on smart contracts. codius is back ! let's see where that goes.] ....and at the same time, they are on the cusp of annihilating, oh well, the biggest payment network in the world (swift). #ripplesglobaltakeover"	1
for many people invested into xrp, and crypto in general for that matter, this is our first real investment. i'd say like 80% of this sub is filled with people who've just got into crypto in the last 1-3 months, which includes me. if you got into xrp around the stagnant period of .20, you've never experienced any sort of correction. it tests your emotions and your patience. view this correction as a learning experience and come out with a stronger hand. we just dropped a lot of the market because the majority of the price surges this past month have been from either people in it for the extremely short term, or people that don't have it in them to stomach crypto volatility to begin with. if we truly believe in this technology and the people behind it, it shouldn't be so concerning. i know many of us aren't worried one bit and probably haven't lost a wink of sleep, but i know first hand for a lot of us it's been quite stressful. we're all in different places in life and this investment means different things to different people. on another note, the amount of fud, misconception, and straight bullshit ripple and xrp are being bombarded with is straight appalling haha. it's kinda hilarious but pretty fucked up. people spend more time and energy bashing xrp than they spend promoting and discussing their own investment choices. don't let this stuff get you, if you've done the proper research you know it's all propaganda. just hold onto your ballsacks and hodl onto xrp. 🚀	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/contrarians-no-longer/ we can no longer consider xrp a contrarian choice for investment. in today's blog, i explain how xrp is now probably considered a fairly mainstream choice for cryptocurrencies, and how different world organizations have recognized the trends in dlt that make investment in - and usage of - digital assets more mainstream. i also cover the latest news affecting the xrp ecosystem. &nbsp; this includes an analysis of crypto-assets by the g20's financial stability board and a resolution adopted by the european parliament. &nbsp; sibos, swift's annual conference is coming up on october 22nd, and i describe what to expect for ripple. news about ripple also involved a video of ethan beard describing how xpring promises to invest in new use cases for xrp. &nbsp; the news from the xrp community includes an exciting analysis of social media and internet search trends, as well as a tweet from wietsewind to elon musk. all that and more! &nbsp; i hope you enjoy the read & please leave any feedback below. thank you & sincerely, - hodor	1

"if you go to mr. arrington’s twitter profile and the tweets that he has favorited, or “liked” (https://twitter.com/arrington/likes), you find that he has favorited a tweet (https://twitter.com/xrp_news/status/942961973733576704) saying the following: ""i truly believe xrp will be the highest performing asset of 2018. #xrp #xrpthestandard #ripple” the tweet was posted 11 hours ago. if anyone knows something that we don’t, it’s probably mr. michael arrington. conclusion? hodl."	1
stop looking at the market every hour. set a reminder on your phone and live life. looking at the market makes some of us think one of the following: 1. should i sell it at $1.15 and buy again at $0.97? 2. what if i do sell it at $1.15 and it doesn't go back down? 3. damn, i sold it!!!! let's just relax people. hodl and enjoy xmas.	0
"https://twitter.com/mercury_fx_ltd/status/965914410698072064 in this tweet mercury says, ""you'll be the first to hear when we go live soon!"" if they are going live soon this can only mean that xrapid tests are going smooth. very exciting!"	1

for context: 68 days ago i posted here suggesting that ripple make a commercial where they demonstrate how it’s faster to fly money around the world - here’s the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ripple/comments/99fj04/it_would_be_cheaper_to_fly_the_money_to_london/e4p6kjj/?context=3 well, they actually did it! here’s their latest ad: https://mobile.twitter.com/ripple/status/1057302054606012417?s=21 cool, right?	1
well first of all sbi has a stake in ripple. the following just seems very logical to me. in order for banks/fis to begin using xrapid they would prefer the price to be higher than it is now for liquidity purposes. sbi, fully understanding this, announce they are opening a crypto exchange with xrp being the only offered option initially. price goes up, they get the liquidity they need. they start xrapid usage, that massive volume is sure to surprise the crypto world, this naturally raises the price and fomo increases the price even more. i've also read that xrapid could even be used within japan, not just for cross-border payments. i couldn't find a link on that, just read somewhere at sometime that their internal money transfer system was very inefficient. other banks are now willing to adopt because of this success. call me crazy, but this seems incredibly obvious to me. *edited for shit grammar, it's probably still shit but works for me lol	2
[https://www.sbivc.co.jp/](https://www.sbivc.co.jp/) although it is not live, the site has been updated and it looks customer ready. they now have many sub\-pages, including a service overview, a guide on how to deposit/withdraw money, a q&a about cryptocurrency virtual currency, the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and how to secure your cryptocurrencies. one thing that i noticed in that in the 'about cryptocurrency virtual currency' page \([https://www.sbivc.co.jp/support/cryptocurrency/](https://www.sbivc.co.jp/support/cryptocurrency/)\), there is a section 'about individual virtual currencies' at the bottom of the page. currently they have only written about xrp \(and no other crypto as of yet\). i feel that this shows how serious they are about xrp seeing as they have prioritized writing about xrp ahead of btc/bcc.	1
i am happy with xrp performing so well but i have to say that i'm annoyed by alot of people posting moon shit and other stupid stuff. only last week i looked at this sub and there were maybe 20 posts telling everyone how bad this coins performance is and how everyone is getting out because xrp will never rise in value. now all of a sudden everyone loves the tech, wants to buy in and complains that the price has risen so much because they can't get in cheap. i have been a silent reader on this sub for a long time and really like it because i had a strong feeling that there are a lot of informed and calm people on here who are actually interested in the company and everything it has to offer. i just wouldn't like seeing this going to the gutter! i know this is going on everywhere but i just kind of needed to vent, sorry...	2

so i made a thread before about this, but it ended up getting more into taxes then actually selling xrp, so how would you guys suggest selling such large amounts of xrp? is there a way we can sell xrp for money direct deposited into your bank account? because my issue with selling it for bitcoin then selling the bitcoin on coinbase is the chance that the price drops suddenly or doing all the transactions of moving all the coins around, so i am just making this thread to get some insight on your guys plans.	1
don't see this news being posted so i decide to share it :). the exchange is located in singapore and is pro-compliant. it has just had a new engine launched and is about to accept institutional customers in a week or two – wonder how much it would benefit xrp as a base pair. coins pair with xrp are: lsk/xrp dash/xrp ark/xrp eos/xrp neo/xrp usdt/xrp usdc/xrp tusd/xrp gusd/xrp omg/xrp ltc/xrp	2
"this thread is starting to look like /r/cryptocurrency. half the posts on the front page of this subreddit are non ripple/xrp related. then we have the ridiculous posts that honestly no place here, have no sourcing, pure speculation. every time we see a 5% drop we have the ""is this the right time to invest in xrp"" posts and when we see a rise we see the ""why ripple will take over swift"". i've honestly stopped coming here as much as just use xrp chat. the mods don't seem to do anything about it despite how many times i report posts for not being ripple related. this subreddit should be kept 100% ripple news/xrp news/analytical posts from the likes of hodor and other contributors."	2
"hey all just got back from a camping trip and i'm hearing all this noise and worry over xrp being labeled a security. frankly, i can't believe anyone would even think up of some nonsense like this so let me clarify why xrp cannot be branded as a security for any reason: **the howey test** https://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html i see a lot of bs arguments linking back to this. the above link provides you proper context ""the ""howey test"" is a test created by the supreme court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as ""investment contracts."" if so, then under the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934, those transactions are considered securities and therefore subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements."" and it breaks down like this: **1) it is an investment of money/assets** **2) there is an expectation of profits from the investment** **3) the investment of money/assets is in a common enterprise** **4) any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party** let's start by breaking this down point by point. 1) **ripple specifically states that xrp is not meant to be used as an investment vehicle**. the courts do not care if you feel it's an investment or if that's what you think you're doing, they care if it is being sold, branded, and understood by institutional players as such. and as we know from ripple.com as well as the news we've seen this year, xrp is currently in use by institutions for its intended purpose(s) and not as a form of investment in ripple. 2) **not a single soul has promised that xrp will go up in value while you hold it or even at all.** yes, we all understand that to do what it wants to at the end of the day it should, but that by no means guarantees a profit to anyone for anything in any way. if you buy a videogame and hold onto it for a couple decades, its value is almost bound to go up, especially if it's from a 1st party developer, that by no means defines those games as securities because they have uses and are not tied in value to their parent company. 3) there is no common enterprise. **""most federal courts define a common enterprise as one that is horizontal, meaning that investors pool their money or assets together to invest in a project.""** <-- i would love to see someone argue that buying xrp off of an exchange is somehow funding ripple. this is not an ico, ripple makes money by selling off their own software to other companies just like apple, microsoft, etc. they do not make money from people buying xrp as a concept and more people holding xrp does not somehow amount to ripple gaining more money. edit - they sell it on exchanges as well, and but not all of the xrp on exchanges belong to them by any means and so buying xrp on exchanges would still not automatically affect ripple's balance sheet like it would if buying xrp was truly meant to serve a common enterprise. 4) **""the final factor of the howey test concerns whether any profit that comes from the investment is largely or wholly outside of the investor's control. if so, then the investment might be a security. if, however, the investor's own actions largely dictate whether an investment will be profitable, then that investment is probably not a security.""** <- as it so happens to be, the price of xrp is entirely determined by the people buying and selling it. ripple does not determine the price of xrp and is in fact under myriad self-imposed contracts so that they have a maximum point of sales so as not to affect the price. we also know that this market is entirely manipulated by the ""investors"" much to the chagrin of most institutions, this is such a prominent problem that the words ""...but what about the volatility..."" make all of us collectively bite our lips so as not to smack the nearest cnbc pundit. and beyond the above points the following is also true: a) **xrp's ledger was invented before ripple labs/ripple came into existence. ripple cannot be the issuing party.** b) **ripple's stash of xrp was legally gifted to them by the inventors of its ledger**, and so any sales of xrp are not only perfectly legal, but because of its original gift status, it can't be considered as an intrinsic part of the company itself and its wellbeing is completely up to adopters and people who use it. c) it can be used. it is a tool. the fact of the matter is, securities only have value in that they can be spent as value. **the whole reason securities are regulated differently is because they rely on a promise of value attachment. you can't do anything with stocks except hold them, trade them, and sell them. xrp has proven use cases from multiple institutions leading all the way up to central banks around the world.** d) **xrp functions completely and totally independent of ripple.** yes, ripple has chosen to up its adoption and build enterprise software around it, but that doesn't mean that the xrp ledger wouldn't work on its own. in fact it has been just fine for almost 6 years and is the most liquid decentralized exchange on the planet. no joke. and **e) you receive no special rights from buying xrp. you do not own a part of ripple. period.** and even after all of this. let's not forget, they have **benjamin lawsky** on their board of directors and they have an entire wing of their own company dedicated to compliance. i sincerely doubt the originator of the us's first real crypto legislation is going to let the sec stay uninformed enough to brand it a security. **also considering they have members of their team advising the fed for the faster payments task force, ryan zagone confronting parliaments/governments/institutions globally as director of regulatory relations as well as chris larsen being on the board with imf,** i sincerely doubt that anyone in government responsible for these calls is still in the dark. ripple has also made a sincere effort in making sure people understand that xrp is not a security and they tend to get their agenda across. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/ripple-says-its-cryptocurrency-xrp-is-not-a-security.html ***tl;dr:*** when you buy xrp, you're buying software. no one promised you profits, ripple even says it isn't for investing purposes, you have no shares in any company, ripple cannot do anything to affect the price directly, and you have many ways to use it that are currently functional and demonstrated by institutions. they also have the best guy possible for legal and regulatory clout, so i sincerely doubt that anyone responsible and objective should think that xrp is a security. ----------------------------------------------------important edit-------------------------------------------------------------- https://twitter.com/bankxrp/status/992779266562625536 as it so happens, in the time since i've posted this, it's been announced that ryan zagone, director of regulatory relations at ripple, will be a key speaker at a 7 hour forum held on monday (the day of the sec's ruling) to talk about the many possible uses of emerging fintech for banking, and it's hosted by the fdic. pretty sure this brings the point home just a bit more."	1

"hey guys, it seems that a few people now like to post their trade analysis and give their predictions on what they think will happen. a good example is someone who posted a day ago. he/she claimed that they are consistently correct and predicted that the price would be 0.95 within 24 hours (the price was 0.935 at the time of this ""prediction""). now it is 24 hours later, and this prediction is absolutely incorrect, seeing the price is 0.85. no one knows anything. it is easy to sit in a bull market and predict that the price will keep increasing, but once the price starts to decline, these people generally say nothing, and if they do, they turn around and predict that the price will keep decreasing (literally just following the way the price is going). again, no one knows anything. at the end of the day, there are too many external pressures that affects xrp's price, and no one can know what these are. did anyone take into account the coinmarketcap incident, the coinbase denial of adding xrp, rumours that china was going to stop people mining btc, that south korea were trying to ban cryptocurrencies, and any other fud into their trade analysis? no. if you do feel the desire to share your ta, please just share it in the daily discussion posts, or head over to r/xrp. this subreddit has lately been cluttered with ta posts and there are generally a lot of comments trashing on the poster, so it is obvious that the majority of us don't believe in ta or just feel that it is useless in this irrational market."	2

hey guys, im hodling my xrp through this rough period of fud by i liquidized a lot of my altcoin positions as they will likely take further hits as people look for stability. i had exchanged this for fiat on an exchange i dont fully trust (wont say name). so in order to secure my funds i literally used xrp as a courier to get my fiat onto bitstamp, an exchange i already trust, with basically zero slippage in the price and it happened super fast. i just realised i literally used xrp as a source of trust for liquidity and speed where monetary protection mattered. if i had to do that with fiat, it couldve taken a week. this entire situation just absolutely confirmed to me exactly why xrp is destined for success. when i was under pressure, i trusted xrp over fiat (as well as all other crypto options), banks will soon follow suit.	1
"i am not reporting any news. this is just a theoretical discussion. i came across this link in the xrpchat forum. it is a visualization of all money in existence. http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/ it really gives perspective on ripple's (and blockchain's) potential applications. if anyone is courageous enough to go through all of it, you will see how tiny bitcoin is compared to all the money in existence, that it's almost laughable (and ripple is much smaller). people quote all day about total daily swift transfers and what would be the price of ripple if it would capture 10% of that blah blah blah. boooring. the key word here is *payments*. payments are necessary to buy or sell (or move) any asset. let's take a look at potential payments that blockchain (and ripple) could serve: 1. ""the market capitalization of all of the world's stock market is equal to $73 trillions"". here is a market for you. buying and selling of stocks, globally. currently settles in 3 days. how would you like to speed things up a bit? 2. the world's gold. worth $7.7 trillion. ripple and/or blockchain-powered precious metals exchanges? 3. global money supply: narrow money $36.8 trillion, broad money $90.4 trillion. who controls the money supply? central banks. how can the inject to or withdraw money from the circulation? using blockchain technology. why would they need to do it faster? i don't know, perhaps because if you bail out a bank on friday evening it might cost $10 billion but if you bail out the same bank on monday morning it might cost $100 billion. 4. global debt - currently at $215 trillion - 325% (yes, you read that correctly) of world gdp. that includes private and public debt. who issues public debt? governments. how can they get paid? using blockchain technology and/or ripple. what is wrong with the current system? well you need to pay goldman sachs a fuckton of money to distribute those bonds. how can governments pay their monthly, 3-month, 6-month installments or for bonds maturing? using blockchain technology and/or ripple. same for private debt: credit card payments, mortgage payments, corporate bonds. you can pay for it or receive payment for it using ripple and/or blockchain. 5. global real estate - valued at $217 trillion. i won't get into this too much because it's very much related to mortgages and loans and the role of the banks in that respect isn't going away anytime soon. however, think for a minute how many payments that sum accounts for globally, if individuals/businesses are making or receiving payments for a property they buy, sell or lease (it's cross-border if the owner is overseas) 6. last but not least. derivatives. currently valued at ""it's so fuckin' much that nobody fuckin' knows"". includes futures contracts, forward contracts, options, warrants and swaps. low end estimate: $544 trillion. high end estimate: $1.2 quadrillion. sorry for the caps. yes, you read that correctly. currently settles at: 3 days. wanna speed things up a bit? are xrp's used to buy or sell derivatives at the moment? no. can they be used in the future? you bet. so for anyone courageous enough to read the whole visualization, did you see how tiny bitcoin is compared to global stock markets, gold, global money supply, global debt, global real estate, and derivatives market? and all of this does not include business payments and peer-to-peer payments (hopefully someone can give us the numbers for that too). now think that ripple/xrp is a fraction of bitcoin. look me in the eye and tell me its value will not go up if/when it gets adopted. i won't believe you."	1

as of 8:30am us central time, i've woken up to btc at -1.5% and xrp +16% on coin market cap. while this rise in price for xrp is great news to bag holders, the most profound aspect is it didn't take an equal % rise in btc to get there. while for the past month xrp and pretty much every other crypto coin has ridden on btc's coattails (into the toilet), this is the first recent sign this year of an xrp price increase independent of btc. time to cue the dokken? for the last few weeks us xrp holders have seen the daily positive news articles pertaining to ripple, and it's been baffling to many how the price of xrp hasn't reacted to any of the positive news. it's an inside joke for xrp that no good news goes unpunished. while xrp fans are confident in team ripple and their tech and know why they're holding long, the rest of the crypto community can't fud xrp hard enough and they see ripple as the digital anti-christ. this has meant that most of the recent good news about ripple has fallen on def ears and for every positive new partnership announced, the crypto community has a classic fud-phrase lined up to counter it. does asia know something that the crypto community does not? in the past week, ripple has announced several partnerships with asian banks and companies and japan's sbi holdings xrp-exclusive exchange is supposed to go live this month as well. while this news has left the xrp price relatively unphased over the past week, in overnight trading xrp has seen a 17% rise over bitcoin. while it's to early to know the reason for xrp's price increase over btc, the fact that xrp broke out on it's own is mighty encouraging. maybe in the near future xrp will be more resistant to btc's quarterly and beginning of the year 50% corrections and the price can move more independent of the general crypto market. holding long and strong, i believe this is only the beginning for xrp.	1

"as some of you might have picked up, ripple officially tweeted yesterday that ""*3 of the top 5 global money transfer companies plan to use xrp in payment flows in 2018.*"" (source: https://twitter.com/ripple/status/949131179797626880) however, this doesn't seem to have had any effect whatsoever on the price yet, and a lot of people are still sitting on the fence - waiting for the actual announcements to be made and names to be dropped. &nbsp; but they kind of already have. we know for a fact that we're talking about the top 5 global money transfer companies. and we know that 3 of these plan on using xrp in their daily operations in 2018. even if it was the bottom 3 of these, this is still insanely great news. &nbsp; as of 2016 the top 5 global money transfer companies were: **western union** (*500,000 agents in more than 200 countries*), **money gram** (*350,000 agents in 200 nations*), **ria** (*310,000 agents in 150 countries*), **transferwise** (*600 currency routes in 35 nations*), **worldremit** (*widely distributed through bank deposits, delivery, or cash pickup in more than 110 nations*) source: http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-five-best-remittance-companies-in-the-world-2016-7?r=us&ir=t&ir=t &nbsp; to have 3 of these using xrp in daily operations is massive no matter how you put it. &nbsp; also, just a side note here, i believe michael arrington and nathaniel popper accidentally slipped the names in the following twitter conversation: https://twitter.com/willy_thefirst/status/949396562542780422 (*western union, moneygram*)"	1
i downloaded the app as sokn as it came out a few days ago, but did not have the chance to set it up. today i finally had some time and it took a total of 2 minutes (including registration to money tap and bank setup) in japan currently the bank transfer system sucks. you have to go to the atm/bank or use poorly designed bank apps and transfers can only happen before 3pm. a minute later and it would be transfered on the next day. the transfer time with money tap took 3 seconds, and it was free (transferred to the same bank). if this is not awesome, then i don't know what is!	1

"ripple received a mention in the yomiuri shimbun in japan, titled ""国際送金「数分で」…仮想通貨技術で実用化"" - translated ""cross border payments 'in minutes'... made possible through cryptocurrency technology"" unfortunately the online article has since been removed from the yomiuri online site (published on the 13th of may) so here is the tweet that shows it was indeed put to print. the red circle is where ripple is mentioned (sorry this is all in japanese) the top part of the diagram shows traditional methods (swift) of how money is transferred. https://twitter.com/tyandooo/status/995758135787728896 just a bit of background on the yomiuri shimbun. it is a japanese newspaper published in tokyo and other major japanese cities. it is one of the five national newspapers in japan with a circulation of approx 9-10 million readers. edit: grammar"	1
so many crypto out there, some big some small, some lol. sure, most of them will die as the money moves around. 99% of them will i have no doubt, and whatever money and value in those coins will move to others that remain relevant. only blockchains with a use case will stay relevant, and of those the winners will be the ones on the right side of law and regulation. having lived through the dot com bubble it appears as exactly the same situation is playing out here. https://postimg.cc/image/qn54x7onb/ bitcoin is the napster of it's time. if you too lived through the bubble you'll know how huge napster was. it was massive, it was trying to kill off the media empire, believed to be outside of the control of governments, peer to peer decentralization, anonymous, etc, but slowly regulation crept in and over the course of 3 years it crumbled in to a smattering of users going to extreme lengths to hide their identity to avoid detection by the law, but everyone else left and took their media with them. during that time some alternatives cropped up like limewire, kazaa, but they were all trying to do what napster did with a few twists, but never met napster's heights. in the mean time everyone rubbished services that were on the right side of regulations, that worked with governments to provide a viable business model, lo and behold you end up with itunes, netflix, spotify... the internet of data has matured with market leaders. tpb is still here today. loads of people use it to download content. is it legal? who is making money from it? can you send someone money through the pirate bay and torrent sites? maybe sending someone a movie is saving them money, but are you actually giving them something they can sell legitimately? had you bought tens of thousands of dollars worth of shares in apple, netflix, spotify or others when they were mere pennies, money wouldn't be an issue for you today. that's where we are with xrp. it's regulatory compliant, it's pushing the benefits of blockchain and decentralisation from within the industry, rather than trying to fight it from the outside. oh it will decentralise finance like hell! your bank account and financial affairs will be your responsibility in future, not a bank's, no doubt about that. you can look at it from a philosophical level, from a fundamental level, from experience, or from market movements as in the chart i posted above. be smart with your investments, we're right at the point in which blockchain is becoming mainstream. ripple has the scaleability, the regulatory compliance, the growing adoption, the technology. everything is laid out for all to see, and it is as clear as day for those who understand what is happening. don't waste the opportunity to be an investor of the internet of money, it will never happen again. there aren't many internet's left to be invented.	1
we’re all bored until the next wave up, so let me explain why the price will go up big time. the only condition is xrapid being adopted, which clearly is happening, so the price will go up. here is why (i am not a native speaker, so exuse me if my formulations are not very smooth). 1) there is a limited number of xrps and this number is going down (a tiny fraction of xrp being burned with every transaction). 2) with an increasing volume of transactions and the amount of xrp going down, the value of xrp has to go up to accommodate the rising volume of transactions. with xrp at $1 you cannot move trillions, so the price will have to be higher. 3) xrp is in a fairly unique situation, because it is used as a bridge currency/asset to settle transactions with other currencies/assets. this means that demand doesn’t care what is the price of xrp. if you want to send money from europe to the us, from eur to usd, you don’t care how much one xrp costs, you don’t care if for bridging your transaction there was 10 xrp used or 1000 xrp. in normal market conditions demand wants the price of an asset down, meanwhile offer wants it up. the market price is where demand and offer cross. but as i explained, utility demand for xrp won’t care for the price, only for the spreads/liquidity. so, there is only offer that cares about the price and it wants it up. and technicalities, because as explained in 2), with increasing volume of transactions and decreasing supply of xrp, the price of xrp has to go up. -------------------- now, the question is, who will represent offer with xrp? who are and will be market makers? entities that will accumulate xrp. i think not only exchanges, but also banks, the same way they are market makers for you when you want to exchange fiats, but it is not that important at this time). you want to do a transaction, they will sell you xrps for your fiat and then buy the xrp back with another fiat to settle the transaction in the desired currency. the spread between their sale and buy prices will be their earnings (everything is of course done automatically and takes only seconds within xrapid). but not only that. as they will be xrp holders, they will also be interested in driving the price up in every possible way. this way in the future they might sell some of their holdings for profits and with the increasing price still be able to answer the demand for xrp for the transaction bridging purpose. new market makers will enter the market, because they will want to make money through the market making process and possibly with holding as well. so far the market has been dominated by speculation, this is why the price of xrp is doing such crazy waves. but i think that at this time it is clear that xrp has real utility that will increase demand for this asset. being a market maker is and will be profitable, like with forex. fiat currencies are used to move value, so will be xrp. so, there will be time when present crypto pump and dump whales will become irrelevant with xrp, when the big players will all want the price of xrp to go up and when the price will be way, way higher (forget about the market cap thing, xrp is not a stock, it is a vehicle that will move trillions, so it has to have an adequate value for this task).	0
hey guys, so i own a manufacturing factory in the uk and i've seen this done on a few other crypto forums. my proposal is to create a real life version of xrp as a coin. many of you might have seen the post earlier made by a user with the picture of what an xrp could look like and it was received pretty well. if the demand is there i will start a kick starter to cover the cost of the materials and design fee's and within 4-8 weeks i can be producing a real life version of the xrp coin. if this post gets enough attention and positive feedback i will prepare some scale drawings and graphics to show you what the possible design could look like.	1
"the question ""why will the price of xrp increase?"" gets asked repeatedly, so i thought i'd express my opinion and understanding of how the price will increase and *needs* to increase for xrp to be successful. a common misunderstanding i see is that people are really caught up on market capital and use that calculation to determine how many xrp need to be purchased by banks and institutions to fulfill transactions. this leads to incorrect assumptions where someone says something like ""if i want to send $1 billion dollars to another bank, then i need 1 billion xrp"" (assuming xrp are worth $1 each). that is not how it works. 1 billion xrp is currently 2.6% of the entire circulating supply of xrp, if someone were to sell or buy 1 billion xrp right now, it would wreak havoc on the market and they could potentially not end up with anywhere close to $1 billion after selling 1 billion xrp. let's look at some smaller numbers on poloniex's usdt/xrp pair to clarify this statement. as i write this, xrp is trading at 0.9 usdt (let's just assume that usd/usdt are currently 1:1 for this example as well, and all price figures i give are correct at the time of writing). if i want to send dave's bank $1,000,000 right now, i will need to buy $1 million dollars *worth* of xrp. i can't just buy 1 million dollars at the lowest price, because on the order book that price of 0.9 is only for 6.12 xrp. the next sell order at 0.9014 dollars is 306.54 xrp. and that price keeps going up as you fill each sell order, because that's how order books work. in order to buy $1 million worth of xrp, i need to scroll a long way down the sell orders until the sum of all the sell orders is $1 million. and conveniently enough, the point the sell order summed total exceeds $1 million is at the sell price of 1.000 usdt. when i put in my $1 million dollar purchase, i do not end up with 1,111,111 xrp (1,000,000 / 0.9). i'll end up with somewhere in the region of 1.07 million xrp. as you fill each sell order, it pushes the price up so your average buy in will be somewhere in the region of 0.93 based on poloniex's current order book. but what's now happened? i've consumed every sell order up to the 1.000 usdt mark. i'm now technically sat on 1.07 million xrp valued at $1 each according to the market capital calculation. my $1 million dollar purchase is now magically worth $1.07 million dollars? i just made $70,000 by doing nothing! or did i? of course i haven't, because the exact same process works in reverse for buy orders. something else to bear in mind with this scenario is that bots and traders will see the massive purchase and then start buying in themselves as they think that something important is happening. i.e. fomo by traders/speculators, or automated responses from bots. when dave's bank receives my 1.07 million xrp, he then has to sell them to get his dollars i promised him. so now the exact same process happens in reverse. as he sells his xrp, it drives down the buy price. now hopefully he'll end up with $1 million at the end of it. but if bots/traders see 1 million xrp being dumped, then it could push the price down as people panic (in exactly the same way that buying 1 million dollars worth of xrp would cause fomo). so why does the price of xrp need to be high? it needs to be high to avoid this scenario occurring. i'm just going to use the following figures as examples, they're not in any way price predictions: imagine now that each xrp is worth $100 each. to send the same dollar value, i now need to buy significantly less xrp than i did previously. let's pretend that ends up as 10,000 xrp exactly (i know it won't as per my previous examples). 10,000 xrp is only 0.00001% of the total xrp in existence. so this means that less sell orders get consumed and the price does not jump as much. [joelkatz used a similar example for buying a house with bitcoin]( https://twitter.com/joelkatz/status/963266416462897152) back when it was worth $10 each vs what it is today. if you read that whole twitter conversation, he basically explains this much better than i could anyway. now xrapid already solves this problem somewhat as it *locks in* the sell and buy orders to avoid these spikes, but it still needs the liquidity. as far as my understanding goes, if bank of steve wants to send $1 billion to bank of dave today, then there's just not enough liquidity in the market for xrapid to find the xrp for that transaction. that is why the price needs to and will go up for xrp to succeed and to be used by banks. the price will go up as it gets used by more and more institutions all competing for the same resource (xrp). anyway, that's how i understand things. feel free to please point out any inaccuracies or debate my comments. at the end of the day, we're (mostly) all here because we believe xrp has a bright future. i've been holding since september 2016 and invested back then because of my assumptions above (albeit there was no xrapid back then, but the use case of cross border payments was still the same). edit: typos and reformed introduction. edit2: changing link around as the mobile app appears to be picking up the twitter url and using david's face as the post image."	1
i just went into bitstamp this morning to increase my xrp stack while prices are still low and i saw, for the first time, that i can directly purchase xrp (as well as eth & ltc) with a credit card now. in the past you'd have to buy btc with your credit card and then buy xrp with the btc. the fact that you can now just straight out buy xrp is fantastic. this is what we want coinbase to allow us to do. i bought my xrp and had them in my wallet in a matter of minutes. thanks to bitstamp for making the purchase of this digital asset as simple as possible now. this is fantastic.	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/the-basics-of-xrp/ ever want to send a link to a friend that explains the basics of xrp compared to bitcoin? &nbsp; in today's blog, i go over all the basics of xrp, including its features, capabilities, and include some of the major differences between it and other networks. &nbsp; while it's not an in-depth treatment of 'all-things xrp,' it serves as a convenient reference document if you're looking for a short explanation to share with somebody new. &nbsp; i hope you enjoy the read, and feel free to leave any feedback below. &nbsp; thanks & sincerely, -hodor	1
"i think ripple is currently merging with swift. yeah, i said it. tin foil hat me, bro. so, a few weeks ago, swift just randomly stopped trying to build their own blockchain/ledger. i find it heavily suspect that such an absurdly large organization would simply give up on a technology that even they called ""encouraging"". what's odd is that this happened right around the same time that brad said ripple was going to stop announcing new banking partnerships. what if swift actually just struck a deal with ripple to leverage their technology (since they can't seem to build it) and they are currently merging their clients? this would solve swift's tech problem and ripple's bank relationship problem in one fell swoop. it would also explain why brad is so confident that they will be signing ""a bank a week"" because he knows that with swift on their side, they have their foot in the door with all the banks, now it's just paperwork and logistics. it would also explain why swift tweeted today that their customers must ""change their interfaces and business systems"" by november. maybe swift is prepping to flip a switch and have the entire world banking system switch over to xcurrent with the option of using the cheaper and faster xrapid. maybe, just maybe, swift is full of smart people that know they aren't a silicon valley technology company and they would rather focus on their strong suit, banking relationships. peanut butter, yo. it would also explain u/bearableguy123's absurd price prediction of far over $100 in 2018. if his prediction is true, like his track record, ripple has to be growing at an incredible rate behind the scenes and this seems like an obvious shortcut to be able to do so. maybe the play isn't to replace swift, it""s to be so much better, that you simply become swift. tin foil hat, off; murderous comments, commence."	1
... if you come to paris ! if you want to spare yourself the trouble of cashing out on an exchange, la maison du bitcoin, 35 rue du caire in paris 2nd district, now allows you to come at their counter with your hardware wallet (they are partners with ledger) and exchange your xrp for fiat directly ! they already offered this service for btc and now accept xrp.	2
i should be happy but instead hindsight bias is screaming at me that instead of diversifying between 5-6 altcoins i should have dumped all my money in xrp when i bought at 0.65. i could liquidate all my other positions and buy more xrp now, but this thing can't go above $3-4 unless the whole crypto market cap expands significantly.	2
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/is-xrp-about-to-go-mainstream/ i think xrp is about to hit some mainstream adoption numbers. i talk about what this might look like in terms of volume, as well as the reasons driving this change. hope you enjoy, and feel free to leave any feedback here! - hodor	1

i have to say, everytime the price of xrp plummets, i cheer. i didn't know xrp existed until i saw it on ellen's video that was trending on youtube. have never really thought about crypto much before because i already missed out on bitcoin and never really cared until now. i did research into what xrp was about and why someone like ashton kutcher who is known for his tech investments would donate 4 million using this. the more i research, the more i feel like i'm missing out because i can't amass any faster then i already am. i see the vision ripple is going for and i see how they are signing new companies left and right. i bought 750 xrp so far but my current goal is to be over 3000 xrp. i can safely buy 1000 xrp a month but with how much news there is, the fear of missing out is getting pretty intense. gotta say though, i believe in the vision and i'm glad i saw the ellen video. now i can hope that one day, my debt will be paid off and my family and i will get to live comfortably if i hold out long enough. xrp to the moon! \(after i have atleast 3000 please!\)	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/crytpo-has-the-worlds-attention-xrp-update/ the world is collectively addressing the topic of cryptocurrency. in my previous blog, i analyzed the implications of the us congressional testimony; in this edition, i discuss the g20's recent meeting and discussion of cryptocurrency, along with the next steps that were recommended by the various central bank members. in addition, ripple made an important update to their recommended unl and published the quarter 2 xrp markets report! this blog wraps up by discussing a lot of recent activity in the xrp community as well. hope you enjoy the read; please leave any feedback below! thank you & sincerely, -hodor	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/xrp-milestones-of-progress/ &nbsp; in today's blog i break down significant recent xrp milestones, along with the q3 xrp markets report! &nbsp; the pace of xrp news is staggering; i've packed this article with the highest-profile developments and still had to exclude some interesting developments. &nbsp; ripple news included the quarter 3 xrp markets report, and i provide my perspective on it, along with some action items i recommend for the xrp community. quidax announces their interest in becoming an xrapid partner; ecs, a massive treasury service for corporates, announces plans for ripple tech integration; chris larsen makes his perspective on xrp and digital assets crystal clear at the money 20/20 conference; and a new episode of the ripple drop confirms that multi-hop does indeed activate the option for any ripplenet member to use xrapid. &nbsp; xrp news includes two new exchanges supporting xrp, along with an announcement from wietse that he'd like to integrate the xrp tip bot with wirex. &nbsp; i hope you enjoy the read! please leave any feedback below. &nbsp; thanks & sincerely, -hodor	1

hi new buyers! as bitstamp has a huge backlog and binance have temporarily stopped new members for the same reason, i have been seeing this question a lot the last weeks. so i thought it would be good to write a short guide on how to buy ripple given the current predicament a lot of you are in! i have two options laid out for you. both involve coinbase as that is pretty much the only way you will be able to use your fiat currency (usd/euro) to buy cryptos. first things first, coinbase will get you verified fast (within a couple of hours to a day) since their verification process is automatized. so these guides will be based on you buying eth or litecoin by paying with fiat (usd/euro) on coinbase either through creditcard or bank wire. **option 1:** * 1.open [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) account and get verified. * 2. buy eth or ltc on coinbase. (credit card seems disabled so ath or wire is your only bet now) * 2.b worth to mention: sending from coinbase directly to shapeshift seems to not work for some user. therefore i recommend that you create a personal eth/ltc wallet (such as myetherwallet.com for eth) and send your funds there before sending to shapeshift. this will add a small fee for the transaction but better safe than sorry. i did not need to do this when i did my shapeshifting. * 3. open toast wallet (wallet for ripple on your phone) and read the toast wallet faq carefully * 4. go to [shapeshift.io](http://shapeshift.io) and transform your eth/ltc to xrp. [shapeshift.io](http://shapeshift.io) does not require an account/verification for transforming your funds. all you need is eth/ltc to send to shapeshift, and a ripple wallet for the destination of the funds. **shapeshift steps:** * 4.1. choose your conversion currencies (eth or ltc to xrp for instance) and amount you want. * 4.2 enter your destination adress (this is the adress you have on your toast wallet for xrp on your phone.) * 4.3 shapeshift will then prompt you with an eth or ltc adress and the exact amount of funds to pay so your conversion can occur. edit: make sure that you input your refund adress as well so that the ltc/eth you sent can be refunded to your wallet on coinbase in case transaction at shapeshift fails for whatever reason. edit2: several people have pointed out that the destination tag should be 0 if you are sending the xrp from shapeshift to a personal (non exchange) ripple wallet such as toast. **option 2:** * 1.open [coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) account and get verified. * 2.buy eth or ltc on coinbase. * 3. open an account on [bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com) (you do not need to verify your account if you are not going to buy with fiat and for the purpose of this guide you are simply going to send your already purchased eth/ltc to bitfinex) * 4. send your eth/ltc to the wallets on bitfinex. * 5. buy xrp on bitfinex with your eth/ltc. done! so you can use option 1 or 2 at this stage. you can also use abucoin but i have not done somyself so please those of you that have feel free to add on this post. moderator: can you please make this a sticky for the time being?	2

well congrats to those who bought the dip and big thumps up to those who did hodl during the storm and best of luck to everyone for the future gains. to all the new investers pls try not to panic in future even if you bought high, as long as you have done your research then there is nothing to be worried about. it all works out in the end. peace :)	2
i see daily posts about this but very little substance providing mathematical justifications for xrp price potential. can anyone offer some decent insight here? i keep thinking back to six months ago when bitcoin market cap was pretty much one tenth of what it is now, and people saying “it won’t surpass bitcoin market cap” well it pretty much has past that market cap this week. hindsight is great. so, does anyone have proper mathematical judgements on price points for xrp? my view: 1) current demand should push prices up beyond $1.50-2.00 in the short term. basing this on the fact that there is an unbelievable amount of users still unable to trade and that many exchanges have reported 000,000’s backlog of new customer verifications. market cap becomes c$58bn bottom end. 2) coinbase (basically inevitable now, despite the hoax images, xrp is a good fit for them and there’s incredible demand for xrp) should push price about double, if not possibly a tad more. so pragmatically we go from $1.50 to $3.00. market cap goes to $116bn, still pretty low. 3) some demand ports from bch and btc, possibly short-middle term puts price at $3.5-4.5bn. market cap becomes $135bn bottom end. 4) testing with banks gets through into alpha and beta. liquidity increases and supply inevitably drops due (inspite of regular escrow release) to banks holding a higher fixed quantity of xrp for cross-boarder payments. this is the big one, even smaller end bank demand could need billions of xrp to service it (assuming no alternative iou used). figure the price could be anywhere from $4.5-$15.00 here depending on adopt rate and necessary xrp-flow (currency cash flow) requirements. let’s say really pragmatically, just $7.00 due to slow adoption and some banks opting for iou or another non-ripple inter-ledger based solution. market cap becomes $266bn. still pretty low really, lower than btc is now (well... it’s close...). 5) it’s easy to forget but this is still very much an emerging technology and we’re all pretty much early adopters here. i’d be surprised if we have seen even 5% of the adoption thus far in crypto and specifically into xrp. let’s for the sake of being hyper-pragmatic call it a moderately (as opposed to emergent) adopted market. it’s realistic to envisage that there’s at least a x3-4 consumer demand-base. let’s shoot low and say x2 volume demand adopt. that potentially puts the $7.00 to $14.00. market cap still really rather modest (considering the crypto market cap growth from $50.00bn > $100.00bn > $200.00bn > $300.00bn etc), at $532bn. 6) we could have some massive retailer such as the much muted amazon/uber/airbnb/apple etc innovate the market and adopt the ledger tech, even if not for consumer-facing services (e.g. just for their business transactions). let’s say a less exciting retailer, such as maybe huawei or maybe ebay adopts it and drives the innovation here. that could foreseeably add 20-200% on the demand due to expanded and demonstrable real-use case. let’s say it add just 20% short term (and ignore long term for now, as it’s ridiculously speculative). $14.00 becomes $16.80 and market cap still well within one trillion at $638bn. 7) let’s not even mention replacement of swift, visa and international forex demand which exceeds $5tn daily volume. again, way too speculative. 8) let’s consider that large portions of the supply are being hoarded by investors and banks, or even retailers along with many ripple employees and associates. this could and should create a vacuum and compound demand easily by 10-50%. lets day 10%. $18.48, or market cap at $792bn. 9) i won’t mention depreciation and burn rate of xrp because i’ve not mentioned release of escrow, which could (but is unlikely to) max at 1bn new xrp per month for a few years. but burn rate significantly increases as liquidity does. 10) xrp used more widely for a significantly increased number of currency pairings on the larger exchanges, e.g. xrp/eth, xrp/ltc, xrp/bch etc. immediately much more accessible and lower transaction costs to trade/move currency. really unsure of how this could affect the price but it’s clear it will improve liquidity, burn rate, demand and exposure of xrp. i’ll leave this one out of the maths here. just some basic linear maths (excluding escrow release), with some fairly reasonable and pragmatic assumptions can quite easily put xrp well above $10.00. i really don’t see how xrps price is as low as $1.00-1.25? i’m sure i’ve probably missed loads off this too but the way i (perhaps wishfully) see things is that there’s an offensively large amount of growth here, and hence so many awesome hodlers kicking around in reddit. 🍻 🥂 keen to understand the more reasonable community feedback on this topic. rather than the usual “yea man it’ll be $1,000.00 in three days” crew. ps i do hope it’s $1,000.00 in three days but i won’t hold my breath!	1

"hi xrp'ers @ /r/ripple & /r/xrp, i see a lot of questions about paper wallets lately. got some messages regarding paper wallets as well. this is my attempt at combining all my explanations in one howto. # what is a paper wallet a paper wallet is a xrp wallet you can generate offline and print. when you generate a paper wallet, you generally print it (multiple times) and store the paper wallet in a (very) safe place. don't store all the copies in one building, since you want to be able to retrieve a copy if something terrible happens. one of the advantages of a paper wallet is is that it's ""unhackable"" - if someone hacks your computer, your keys* aren't stored on it. just keep them safe ;) a paper wallet contains 2 keys (text) and most of the times 2 qr codes (one for each key). when your xrp is stored in your own wallet, the xrp's are **yours**. when your xrp is on an exchange, you might loose access to your xrp's (if the exchange goes offline, freezes your account, etc.) - so if you want to hold on to your xrp's for some time, better send them to your own wallet. # how about the wallet keys? there are two keys: the public key (wallet address) and the private key (secret key). the wallet address starts with a **r** and the private key starts with the letter **s**. the wallet address is generated from the private key. this means you can loose your wallet address (the one starting with **r**) since you can just re-generate the same address from your private key. **the private key is for your eyes only (!!!) - if someone has access to your private key they have access to all the funds stored in the ripple wallet.** please don't share your private key, please don't store it somewhere in a document on your computer, and **never** enter it somewhere **except if you trust the place you are entering the key**. your wallet address (starting with **r**) is kind of your ""xrp wallet bank account number"". you can send xrp to this wallet. you can check the transactions from your wallet (more below, 'consult'). your private key (starting with **s**) is kind of your pin + username + password for online banking: you can access all your funds and send them somewhere. risky! --- # how to generate a paper wallet there are many places offering to generate your paper wallet, however: **some of them can't be trusted**. imagine the website generating the wallet stores the generated values, and waits untill you deposit your xrp: since they have the private key they can steal your funds. i prefer generating a wallet with open source code, so the geeks can audit the source code. **[here you can find a wallet generator i trust](https://octillionsa.github.io/generate-ripple-wallet/)**. you can even [download](https://github.com/octillionsa/generate-ripple-wallet) it and run it locally (offline) if you want to (offline) generate a vanity wallet (wallet with your own keyword / name in the wallet address) you can **[check this out](https://github.com/wietsewind/xrp-vanity-generator)**. >**big fat warning for safari osx and ios (iphone/ipad) users** safari on osx and ios **may** generate **invalid keys** resulting in an invalid private key. this means that, if you one day try to access your funds, you can't. **do not ever** generate your paper wallet on a mobile device, and if you're working on an mac with osx, **do not use safari**, use google chrome, firefox, vivaldi, etc. instead! ## **security** if you want to be sure the generated values aren't stored, you can download the source-code, store it at your computer, unplug your computer from the internet, reboot, generate, print, reboot and plugin the internet again. if you're a geek yourself, you can generate a wallet offline using the nodejs ripple-lib code. [here's a sample](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wietsewind/01f1eb0819533ed0226b2777618f253d/raw/86a2546070c623b870ab2a6d1df95f6263859e02/generate-xrp-wallet.js). --- # how to get xrp into your wallet (deposit) send xrp to your wallet address (starting with **r**). most exchanges offer to withdraw xrp. you can enter your wallet address as the recipient. if you are asked for a destination tag and the address you are sending the xrp to is your own paper wallet, you can leave the _destination tag_ empty or enter a zero (0). the destination tag can only contain numbers, and can be used to distinguish funds entering your wallet. --- # how to check my balance since the xrp ledger is open to the world, the whole world can check your balance. however: as long as you keep your wallet address to yourself, no one will know the wallet belongs to you. to check your balance, you can use one of the publicly available tools, and enter your wallet address. i like these two: - **https://bithomp.com/explorer/** - **https://ripple.com/build/ripple-info-tool/** of course you can install a wallet on your phone or computer and check your balance with the app; the app can be used to transfer/withdraw your xrp as well. for ios and android, give **[toast wallet](https://toastwallet.com/)** a spin. **note: if you decide to use one of the available wallets, remember you have to enter your _private key_. only enter the private key if you trust the app. remember: if anyone gains control over your private key, they can steal your funds**! however: since toast wallet is open source, everyone can audit the source code. --- # how to get xrp out of your wallet (transfer/withdraw) to send xrp from your wallet to another wallet address (like the wallet address of an exchange) you need to generate a transaction and sign the transaction with your **private key**. you can do this with any xrp wallet you trust. if you install wallet software you can enter your private key to allow the wallet software to sign your transaction. if you install toast wallet on your ios or android device, you can set a pin code, and then go to: - add wallet - existing wallet - enter the private key in the first field, leave the address field empty (it will be generated from the private key). enter a description and pick a password. you need the password to confirm transactions for this wallet in toast wallet. if you want to use [gatehub](https://www.gatehub.net/), you can access your own wallet: - wallet - <+> (add wallet) - import (enter your gatehub password) - enter your secret key"	1
"this post is an anecdote to hopefully prepare some of you for a ride you may not be expecting. i believe many within the cryptocurrency sphere are simply waiting for ""the next bullrun to the moon"" and i see it on this subreddit as well. the summer of 2014 a buddy of mine and i decided to put a couple grand into penny stocks, weed stocks to be precise, it was the hot topic at the time much like cryptos are today. we quickly got incredibly lucky and turned that $2,000 into nearly $90k within about a month. over the next two months we kept trading...and trading...and trading... our way down to $30k. at this point we found a company called tweed, they were going to ipo onto the canadian stock exchange, were one of 8 marijuana growers and distributors to be licensed by canada. they were working hand in hand with regulators, had audited financials, and followed all the rules. we bought in with our $30k at about $3 a share. for a month or two the stock dragged down and sideways while all the other penny stocks were making gains of 50,100, 200% some days. we wanted that action we sold everything and got back to trading eventually losing our way to about $5k. it's been 4 years since that summer, tweed is now listed on the nasdaq as canopy growth corp. sitting at a healthy $61.52 a share. we missed the opportunity of a lifetime due to impatience, being young, not understanding the value of a solid business plan versus false promises. xrp is my personal second chance to not fuck up. a digital asset with several use cases, backed by several organizations whose sole goal is to see it succeed, working with regulators, a solid business plan, and goals for several years to come. i will not lose patience, 2-4 years is a drop in the bucket if xrp does what i believe it will do. take the time to understand your investment, understand that ""moon eoy"" is not the goal, utility and use case are. xrapid, coil, codius, will more than likely **not** take us to the moon anytime in the next 6 months. i believe we will see slow but steady growth once xrapid is announced, there may be fomo due to the speculators but utility will drive the price one day. i believe we hold a digital asset that will change the world, in time, and one day the patience and and investment will be worth it."	0
marjan delatinne, the global head of banking at ripple and wim raymaekers, the global head of banking at swift will meet face to face to discuss the future of finance, to be more precise, the future of cross-border payments. the exciting debate is set to take place next month in february, and it will be moderated by ceo and founder of corporate treasury management company bellin, martin bellin. very exciting!	1
"i just had a read of the sbi info briefing. some interesting ripple/xrp and general crypto stuff coming up including sbi virtual currencies (which starts page 117) including why they predict that sbi vc will ""grow into the overwhelming no. 1 position within the industry"" (p121). also some ""strategies for expanding and developing cryptocurrency markets"" including institutional investment (from p126). this should bring some new volume into the crypto market over the next few months. https://www.sbigroup.co.jp/english/investors/disclosure/presentation/pdf/180628presentations.pdf interesting that they also suggest that r3 partner with ripple p147."	1
looking at https://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/ripple-xrp and noticed xrp/btc trading pairs are less than 10% of total trading volume, during a period of high trading volume. this has been true during high volume trading periods. what this tells me: 1) the conventional wisdom that btc or eth is needed for trading or buying xrp is becoming increasingly less true, and based on the top trading pairs krw & jpy, is a very western way of looking at a much more global liquidity picture. 2) looking at cmc market share graph, as btc reclaims more market share, this has mostly been at the expense of eth is giving up far more % market share than xrp in the last few weeks. this gives me hope in an otherwise bleak market. this positions xrp well for the next bull run, whenever that may be. 3) the relationship with btc price is in how the markets move as an asset class holistically, usually through automated bot trading based on ta, and not in the fact that btc is the onramp for buying xrp. nothing earth shattering here, just more of a discussion point in trying to better understand the effect of btc on the xrp market.	1
"this is something that is rarely mentioned in thinking of the future of xrp, but through experience i have learned it to be the quickest, most efficient and cheapest. in my early days of trading on multiple exchanges, i used to use eth or btc for such affairs, most trading pairs were btc or eth based and it made sense. however, the reality is that btc and eth are garbage for sending value. both are slow and costly. i chose to give xrp a try back when it was in it's low volatility $0.25 days, because i needed to escape the scam that usdt is and procure fiat for stability purposes in a bear market. long story short, while my friends continued to complain about eth being a slow, non-scalable, kitten plagued network, this process took me a total of 1 minute. it is worth noting that this is essentially what a bank would do with xrp, but instead of using xrp as the conduit through which value is sent from country to country it is a micro-level transaction from exchange to exchange. i believe this realization by the masses will bring increased trading pairs and increased volume using xrp as the base. when and if coinbase adds xrp, the advice being given to noobs will be to ""buy xrp and send it to x exchange,"" and no longer ""buy btc/eth and send it to x exchange."" even if one were to do an extra transaction and purchase btc/eth at the other end, it would be cheaper and quicker than just sending the btc/eth."	1
last year around november 18th when bitcoin reached $8000, xrp was at .22 cents. despite downtrends, we're ahead from where we started. keep that in mind as we continue to progress.	1

"ok i rarely post anything on reddit, and it's actually the second time i post something on this subreddit. i feel like it's important as a community to express how we are feeling right now about ripple, and xrp. the reason is i see too much fear, every day from too many people. i got into xrp thanks to a colleague who got into it after listening to another colleague. we are 21 people in my workplace, and half of us now have money invested in xrp. so every day, they come to me, and talk about it. lately it was a lot of fistbumps and high fives. in the past couple of days, however... i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. ""wtf with that price ! omg i'm losing money... bla bla..."" and i always laugh, and do the job of a psychiatrist sometimes. i always ask them ""are you planning to sell tomorrow ? next year you say ? then why the f*** would you care about what the price is today !!!"" so yes, if we are here to hodl, no reason to sweat. at all. ever. we will make that money, there nothing showing that we won't. breathe in, breathe out, relax. p.s : i'm not a native english speaker. hope it was clear enough."	2

because btc and eth are busting at the seams with the high transaction volumes just trying to transfer them to other exchanges that offer the lucrative altcoins everyone is trying to buy. i have been wanting to get in on xlm, trn, and dnt for over a month now but have been turned off at how difficult and down right sketchy it is to purchase them on these less than reputable exchanges. i finally broke down and bought some eth on bitstamp and transferred it to my liqui.io account so i could purchase some trn. it’s been 2 days and my eth still isn’t in my liqui.io wallet, not even showing as pending. it either that liqui.io is a scam and stole my eth or the eth blockchain is under too much strain and it’s taking forever. and i’m thinking it’s the latter since my buddy is having the same issue with eth transfers. i think it’s just ridiculous that these cryptos such as btc and eth that claim they are the future of currencies that can overtake fiat, yet crumble under the pressure of increased volume. for the currency of the future, the transaction times makes it feel like i’m using ancient tech. anyways, i just want a solid altcoin exchange that uses xrp as the main pair to make these transactions and purchases nearly instantaneous. i shouldn’t have to wait a week for my funds to clear just to make an altcoin purchase. end rant.	1
hi, everybody! i want to boast little bit about the targets we reached! since ripple was listed on [cryptwerk.com](https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xrp/) several months ago xrp ecosystem has grown on 200% now we have in the list 350+ different companies and stores where you can pay with xrp! thank you everybody for the support! **xrp mass adoption is started!** and the link to the updated xrp zone >>>> [pay with xrp](https://cryptwerk.com/pay-with/xrp/) https://i.redd.it/kencm6iitey21.png	2
1. listing on coinbase (forkbase), retail market driven 2. sec declaration of its legal status (investor certainty signal) retail and institutional speculative drive 3. production deployment of xrapid (institutional utility drive) (banks, remittance providers, payment apps like alipay,.etc.) 4. announcement by central banks of backing of stable coin on xrp ledger (fomo by entire planet) 5. xrp etf (institutional speculative) 6. xrp used by sbi holdings for forex settlement (institutional utility) 7. announcement by major institution (fidelity, black rock, etc.) of institutional custodianship for digital assets (including xrp) (institutional and retail speculative) 8. codius deployment commits on github rising exponentially when developers realize the coding is agnostic, settlement time and transaction fees are virtually nonexistent (development utility for institutional and retail use cases) 9. ripple announces production level product for derivatives trading and settlement using codius smart contracts and xrp ledger (institutional utility) 10. btc bull run with trickle down crypto economics 11. use by the arabian peninsula for oil contract settlements any single one is equivalent to trillion dollar markets at full utility. i think ripple is working on all of these! people, step back and stop looking at bullshit manipulated crypto charts, the stars are aligning. buy as much as you possibly can, sell blood. get ready and start worrying about how you're going to hide all your money.	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/consensus-model-vs-proof-of-work/ consensus is better than proof of work. when it comes to all categories of strengths for a decentralized cryptographic network, xrp is stronger than bitcoin in every category: double-spend prevention, security, censorship-resistance, dependability, scalability, and settlement speed. the fact that we're even still talking about bitcoin in 2018 is a testament to how effective protectionist market interference can be; but xrp doesn't care - it is being adopted at scale by real businesses for real global commerce. there are a myriad of reasons for this, but in this blog, i focus in on one specific aspect of xrp: its transaction validation model and how it compares to bitcoin. i hope you enjoy! please leave any feedback below. sincerely, -hodor	1

in roughly 13 months (jan. 2017 to jan. 2018) we experienced the price of 1 xrp go from $.006 to $3.80. this is a **63,233.33%** increase. sounds ridiculous, but this the reality. most of the year was stagnant around $.20, with the majority of volume being between dec. - jan (just two months!). as we know, this was all driven by retail investors and speculation. if we followed the same % increase for eoy 2018/early 2019 bullrun at our current price. **$.48 x 63,233.33% = $304** that sounds crazy, but if we were able to get a 63,000% increase just from us retail investors.. why is it so hard to believe that xrp can be worth more than $5 or $10 (which is what so many people say is the “cap” and when they will cash out”. there are more people who know about xrp now, and 2018 has been a year of progress, developments, and the strengthening of ripple not only in the crypto space.. but also with institutional investors. we can get $304 if we repeat the same pattern.. except now we will account for the volume xrapid, xvia, xpring, coil will bring to the table. with that said.. this is why i cringe when people swear that we will “never pass $10”. $3.80 to $10 is a measly 163.16% increase. *how do we go from 63,233.33% in 2017, and yet many people expect only 163.16% after xrapid and ripplenet goes live?* thoughts? **please don’t take this as financial advice! meant to be a fun discussion to run off with and to get everyone’s input & perspective**	1

"it's sort of sad to have been swamped by ""to da moon"" posts just a few days ago, now people in literal panic saying ""my friend told me not to invest! maybe he was right all along"". the coin was a .20 something last month and now it's at 2.70 (according to binance). is that gain really not satisfying enough for you? a correction is healthy. what would scare me is if the coin was at $20 or even $10! that's when i'd be hesitant on holding due to the non-organic nature of such a rise. or another scenario - if ripple's ceo went out and did something terrible for pr. broke promises or lied about contracts. then i'd have some serious doubts about investing. but a correction? i don't know. sort of a petty post, but i saw more and more of them coming in. it's almost akin to a fair weather friend. edit: typo in title. - why all the fud, not ""what all da fudz""."	0

another addition. kfh is a bank that operates under islamic shari'a with around $55b in assets. i am assuming this announcement for xcurrent. https://twitter.com/kfhgroup/status/1000347465080541184 news articles https://alqabas.com/540946/ http://www.alanba.com.kw/ar/economy-news/835580/27-05-2018-%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%aa%d9%83-%d8%a3%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%a8%d9%86%d9%83-%d9%83%d9%88%d9%8a%d8%aa%d9%8a-%d9%8a%d9%86%d8%b6%d9%85-%d8%a5%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%b4%d8%a8%d9%83%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a8%d9%84/ translation: basically it says that kfh is the first kuwaiti bank to join ripplenet to provide its customers cross-borders transactions with less fees and less errors.	1
"kind of a shit title now that i think about it but there seems to be a lot of fud going around about how xrp is basically worthless as it wont be used and that the real value of ripple is in the technology they sell. i decided to do some research on this. i recall an interview with brad garlinghouse saying that an increase of value of xrp is essential for liquidity, but i couldn't find it. instead i found quite a lot of other good info ""for ripple, we use this digital asset, called xrp, to settle liquidity needs between banks. so today, there's $27 trillion parked at different banks around the world, so they can make payments between each other. our view is that you can use a digital asset like xrp to do that in real-time."" ""so it just passes through that currency for that period of time?"" ""that's correct"" (https://youtu.be/vngnycbhjle?t=10m2s) banks will most likely create their own token for use with their private ledgers to use with the interledger protocall. it doesn't matter if a bank uses their own token with the interledger protocol as it will pass through their own token as well as xrp. check out this image: https://interledger.org/rfcs/shared/graphs/protocol-suite.svg [this site](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0003-interledger-protocol/) provides a lot of info on how the ilp will function. it makes complete sense for a bank to create a token (new ledger) for use with **interledger** protocol technology."	0

ok guys, here is what i think is going to happen over the course of the next few days. with all of the recent bad press surrounding bitcoin due to slow transfer times, high fees, etc. what we are witnessing is a large transition of market share over from the 'top 3' (btc, eth, ltc) and it's pouring into ripple after it's proven itself, to be almost resistant to the influxes in price recently. ripple is already recovering from this 'crash' 20x faster than other cryptos. people are using this downturn to revisit and reassess their portfolios and many people are seeing the volatility of btc and coming over here. ripple is going to take the no.3 market cap spot from bcc imminently and remain there for the early part of 2018. congratulations to everyone who held out through this dip, you're about to reap the rewards.	2

i bought 3k xrp at 0.4 and just sold 500, or 16% of my xrp giving me my initial investment back as well as an extra $150. i also just uninstalled my price tracker off my phone, while i fully believe xrp will rise, having nothing to lose is a crazy good feeling. it could go to $0 and i lose nothing, or it can go to $10 or $100 and i still make a great profit. maybe i got lucky, 0.4 to $2.4 is a crazy jump in the 1 month i've been on, and i really wanted to wait for another spike to sell my 500xrp, but i decided with the recent fud and bs i just don't want to risk it anymore. i have my initial money back. to me its a major stress relief and i already feel better. now what happens to xrp is much less for me, and as a college student with no job not being able to lose money is a great feeling. i'm going to check once a week or so, but i just couldn't handle the stress of checking every hour hoping i still have money at the end of it.	1
i will start with one word: roadmap. ripple has a great track record of ticking off milestones on their roadmap (a common trait with any highly succesful business). with a couple of mouseclicks, it's easy to see the amount of stuff that's coming down the pipeline for 2018 (official stuff, not speculation). if i was still buying (i'm at my bag limit), i would not hesitate with the recent dip (i've been buying since june/july, with my last purchase at us$1.25). any newcomers who may have bought in at the top yesterday - please do not panic. most of us around here have already experienced those white-knuckle rides so we feel for you. well i do anyway. just walk away for a few days and enjoy life then check back in. or even better, pick up some discount xrp before the next run from someone who panic sells. once again, xrp will shine 2018-2020. enjoy the ride everyone.	1
i saw so many posts asking and discussing whether sbi will exclusively list xrp or if it will list more currencies at launch, below is the link to an announcement from the official ripple website, it is from january but at least it is official and not from some shitty teenager reporter website.. https://ripple.com/insights/sbi-virtual-currencies-to-exclusively-list-xrp-at-launch/ not only that, sbi will also be using xrapid sbi virtual currencies (sbi vc) is looking to join the xrapid ecosystem — ripple’s enterprise-grade solution — to help institutions source liquidity for cross-border payments between japan and the rest of the world. ripple will eventually integrate sbi vc’s apis so that xrapid users — payment providers and banks who are transferring money into and out of japan — can convert xrp to jpy and jpy to xrp instantly through sbi vc. great times ahead folks 👍🏻	1
there is a huge amount of criticism floating around as always at the moment regarding xrp's value to ripple and so in turn, the investor. with this in mind, maybe its good to take a step back every now and then and have a look at the bigger picture than xrp when considering if it has value in the future, or if this dip really is 'the end' for this crypto (which it certainly is not!!) ripple as a business has achieved an undeniably huge achievement. they have not only started to get adoption from banks, one of the slowest and most cautious sectors to target as for innovation, but they have allowed santander to enable the public the ability to send international payments and money transfers internationally for the first time in history on the same day as they are sent. regardless of your views on ripple or xrp, this is certainly a huge step for innovation of money transfers, and is a real pivotal point for something which has been a long time coming, comparable to the first use of an email over a letter. xrp is just the next logical step for a bank to take, cutting costs further, saving other parties money, but it will take time, as anything does, for trust to be gained. just my two zerps there! x	0
below is the actual copy/paste email. sounds like a little kid running back saying “naha i told you so!” i thought the ratings were pretty laughable and uninformed for crypto (looking at xrp=doge of course). that’s my personal opinion. we all know we have a real world use case and the announcements will keep going. but this email makes these guys seem like children. smaller risk and bigger profits dear investor, now do you see why no cryptocurrency got an a in our inaugural ratings release last week? now does it make more sense why bitcoin got a c+? now do you understand why the industry's outrage against our ratings was, in itself, a telltale sign of more troubles ahead? you see, from the outset, all of the risks evident in the market today have been factored into our risk index. but the good news is that much of the greed and hype is getting cleansed from the market even as we speak. this week, the market first got smacked with the coincheck hack, the largest in cryptocurrency history (in u.s. dollar terms). then it got slammed with the tether dilemma. crypto markets tanked. market cap, which started the week at around $600 billion, plunged to just above $400 billion this morning. in today’s issue of weiss cryptocurrency ratings, we give you … simple steps so you can use our ratings to aim for smaller risk and bigger profits. a complete list of all our latest ratings and how to use them. in-depth reviews of the few cryptocurrencies that currently get our “buy” rating and are the most likely to give investors the best returns. plus much more. if you are a subscriber, check your in-box now. if you’re not, you can sign up here. best wishes, the weiss ratings team	1
since we launched xrp trading pairs, deposit and withdrawal, we encountered many cases about depositing xrp to coinex without including destination tag. it took us lots of time and energy to recover xrp for users. soon we decided to seek a way to solve the problem once for all. i tried to contact the dev on telegram, twitter, email and discord, it's difficult for people to answer me because the questions i asked are something technical. eventually an admin mr. h in discord recommended wietsewind to me. wietsewind advised us to enable account flag: asfrequiredest. if a user tries to deposit without a tag, the transaction will be rejected. after he answered my questions and clear doubts, he told me something else. if we are sending funds \(so the customer is withdrawing\) we can also include a sourcetag \(the deposit tag for users\), so the recipient knows to what tag to return the funds if they don't agree on the transaction. many thanks to ripple team again. coinex will keep dedicating to provide better user experience. hope our effort will give satisfaction to users.	2
edit now doing 3 mil a day+ 14 hours the first week everyone stated they weren’t a big exchange ( i contested saying they do more volume than koinex overall). the first week they did 7k, 10k, then 30k in xrp. in 2 days it’s now at 2 million . high this month 10 million over all coins. week two we already seen 1 million. 3 days into the week it’s at 2 millioin usd per day for just xrp volume.. https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/zebpay/ therefore zebpay is significant, especially considering the growth in time to come with india accepting crypto more and more. its .01 % now but with indias new tech innovations, growth, and crypto interest ( along with high population). - im not saying its gonna be a top 10 exchange for volume of xrp, which normally contribute 5% or more, but it can definitely be like the top 11-100 exchanges making up .5% to 1% of the xrp volume. this was in response to stuff like this https://www.reddit.com/r/xrp/comments/7xwgjs/zebpay_is_not_a_big_deal_for_xrp_anyone_who_says/?st=jdue1fzz&sh=7d31e687	1
in just over a month's time i've watched 3 major attitude shifts from commenters on this sub. 1. omg xrp will be worth $10,000 a piece by the end of the year! 2. omg xrp is a complete and utter scam! it will never work! get out now! 3. sigh, looks like xrp is never going to get much bigger. probably just stay this same price forever. it's made me realize just how emotional and short sighted most people are. they don't go by the facts, or the numbers. they just take whatever is happening right now and assume it will always be like that. i'm sure the long holders have seen this cycle repeat ad nauseum by now.	1
i run a small design/marketing company in the uk. i invested in ripple in august this year and finally decided that i would show my support for ripple in the only way i could think of by offering it as a payment method for my current and future clients. my current client base include companies like nissan and siemens. i'm no 'household' name, but i wanted to show my support and push ripple to businesses in my local area. any other small business owners on here who would consider doing the same? ===== *edit: getting quite a few pms from people on here interested in my team doing various design jobs for them in exchange for ripple as a result of this post, this wasn't meant as a cheap way to advertise my company (if it was i'd have linked to my website and didn't for this very reason, but i am happy to facilitate your requests, i appreciate your interest. just pm me if anyone wants anything done.)*	1
"for those wondering how to purchase ripple, quickly and effectively, i am listing the steps here. point of note- it involves purchasing eth on coinbase, which sometimes comes at a premium over other exchanges, but is much faster for getting into xpr. prices/limits are in usd fyi. (1) register account on coinbase and verify (through photo id). this process took me roughly 20 minutes 2 days ago. this will permit use of the account. (2a) register your credit card on the account (takes roughly 30 minutes to verify because you have to wait for 2 deposits to come through in order to verify). i recommend this course of action first because purchasing with a credit card is instant on coinbase, allowing you to quickly access some ripple before it continues to grow towards the .6 limit. the initial credit card daily purchase limit is limited to 100 dollars, but in ripple that's 200 shares! you will also accumulate roughly 13 dollars per day of that weekly limit back, so you can get moving on buy more shares! (2b) register your bank account (this will take anywhere from 3-5 days). this is important to do as well because the initial spending limit is roughly 2k usd. the reason this is second is because the verification takes up to 5 days, and actual bank account purchases of etherium/ltc can take 8 days to actually hit your wallet on coinbase. (3) purchase eth on coinbase. use credit card to purchase the initial 100 dollars on coinbase. the reason i recommend eth over btc is because the transaction/sending fee is higher for btc (which means you get less ripple) and ltc would have to be converted over to eth even tally anyway (due to binance trading only in eth/btc). (4) log in to binance.com and make an account. there is no verification required which is the best part. (5) after registering at binance.com, go to the top right hand corner for menu selection and find the drop down for ""deposits/withdrawals."" find eth on that list and click ""deposit."" this will give you a code to your eth wallet. copy that code. (6) go back to your coinbase.com account (with the 100 dollars of eth) and go to your eth wallet. click ""send"" and enter your address from binance.com. the ""send"" process takes roughly 20-30 minutes in my experience. (7) you will get confirmation of eth having been successfully sent and it will then show up in your ""funds"" pages on binance.com. (8) after you receive funds, go to the binance.com market. go to eth markets. find xpr/eth. click buy xpr. click 100%. (9) sit back and enjoy the ripple ride!!!!! if you found this helpful please use my referral code :) cheers!"	1

whenever a friend asked me why i picked xrp from all the cryptocurrencies i would start to explain in technical terms the pros and cons and i would lose them immediately. now i only make this simple analogy and they all get it. think of about ordering a pizza and instead of getting it delivered in 30 to 45 minutes and tipping the driver a few bucks, you have the pizza in 3 seconds and the driver is more than happy with a fraction of a penny as a tip. i love pizza and xrp.	2
i noticed that david schwartz gave a fantastic answer to what would happen to the price of xrp if xrapid were adopted by large scale banks. it does not take into consideration the buying pressure of money transfer companies such as moneygram, speculators (us) or crypto exchanges. https://www.quora.com/if-a-large-amount-of-banks-were-to-adopt-xrapid-and-started-using-xrp-how-would-that-impact-the-tokens-value - this is extremely reassuring reading given the current bear market we are in. xrp, to me, seems to be a 5+year hold. those that bought and are now at a loss - do not fear. we have made a solid investment for the years ahead. i have read predictions of $100, $500, $1000 per xrp - and if this thing works out - these numbers are not out of the realms of possibility one bit. i think we need to be looking at the bigger picture outside of “bitcoin””, “cryptocurrencies” and “digital assets” and appreciate what ripple is trying to do here. ripple could turn out to be the biggest company in the world. and we are all early adopters irrespective of what happens now, or in 3,6,12 months.	1
"https://github.com/ripple/rippled/releases/tag/1.1.0 ""the rippled 1.1.0 release includes the depositpreauth amendment, which combined with the previously released depositauth amendment, allows users to pre-authorize incoming transactions to accounts, by whitelisting sender addresses. the 1.1.0 release also includes incremental improvements to several previously released features (fix1515 amendment), deprecates support for the sign and sign_for commands from the rippled api and improves invariant checking for enhanced security. ripple recommends that all server operators upgrade to xrp ledger version 1.1.0 by thursday, 2018-09-27, to ensure service continuity."""	1
https://xrpcommunity.blog/brad-garlinghouse-was-right-its-always-been-about-the-use-case/ the use case for xrp rests on a large business use case that provides value for all stakeholders concerned: the businesses that implement it will save 50-70% on their current forex channels, and customers will reap the rewards with real-time money transfers that settle in seconds instead of days. in this latest blog post, i also cover some of the latest news, including brad garlinghouse's ama, and david schwartz's dramatic statements about bitcoin and ethereum's increasing levels of centralization. also, there's a coil meetup, and the xrp tip bot just received one of two amazing upgrades. i hope you enjoy the read & please leave any feedback below. thanks & sincerely, -hodor	1
"so i'm pretty sure that everybody that is following on twitter: xrpl monitor (@xrpl_monitor): https://twitter.com/xrpl_monitor?s=09 you noticed that in the past month there were a lot of big orders some of them a couple of millions, others a few hundreds millions an so on. and according to this article: https://theusacommerce.com/ripple-xrp-definitely-going-used-major-banks-heres-proof/ ""they [xrapid partners] must keep a certain amount of xrp on reserve. those reserves maintain the security of the settlements. not only do all participants have to keep reserves of xrp in order to complete transfers, they can also only transfer xrp to other ledger addresses. moreover, other types of currencies can’t instantly and cheaply be sent across the globe."" also asheesh birla (@ashgoblue): https://twitter.com/ashgoblue?s=09 mentioned here https://www.coindesk.com/100-billion-controversy-xrps-surge-raises-hard-questions-ripple/ “this much is clear: right now the market has a lot of confidence in it.” “yet, while it seems people are rushing into xrp ahead of any real use of the cryptocurrency, birla said that more companies will be announcing their use of xrp in the first quarter of 2018.” “birla said he expects a ""full list"" of xrp users this year, telling coindesk about the xrapid product, which is basically xcurrent with xrp on top: ""there is a whole pipeline of folks now integrating into that product. we'll release names early this year."" “he continued, saying the success of getting banks to use ripple's non-cryptocurrency-related products is positioned as the first step of a bigger plan to move banks to xrp.” in conclusion i think that there are going to be some xrapid partners in q1 for sure."	2

so one thing i wanted to point out and i apologize, as someone hacked my account a few days ago. ripple has the only product that is being used.... everything else is pure speculation. scam coin is what they call it... but how can they call this coin a scam... when the product xrapid is being used and even if it isn't at least the product is already developed. so the reason why ripple is the red headed step child.... well it's centralized. so what is its purpose.... well bank transactions on the daily average internationally cost 5.1 trillion dollars a day. hmmm, so you're telling me that ripple is going to be lightning fast and save banks billions on fees....... that is correct. i'm kind of confused on why people think ripple is this horrible coin. does the ceo look like a lizard that will steal your money... well that i will have to give to the crowd because he does look like a reptilian overlord? do i believe in the project? yes. do i believe that ripple has a purpose? yes do i believe bitcoin is scared because ripple is the complete opposite of the blockchain which is completely opposite of them? yes do i believe most of these bitcoin crypto experts are software engineers and know what they're talking about? 50/50 i am a software engineer and understand most of the projects on the blockchain. can bitcoin keep up with ripple if it doesn't get fast transactions? yes, but not for a long time and by that time, i think bitcoin will have a major issue with speed still. do i believe bitcoin is still a phenomenal coin? absolutely, i still consider it the daddy coin. the reason, why i am putting all of this up here, is i am completely unbiased and come from a very strong background in understanding blockchain technology. can ripple potentially screw over individuals? i always hear this and how i view this comment is absurd. you can make a transaction to remove ripple into bitcoin/eth/litecoin .... if ripple labs wanted to completely screw over many people there are about 10 different ways i'm thinking about right now that i would do it and it just wouldn't make sense. you can't call a coin a scam if a product is there. can you call the ceo or individuals saying that the coin is being used in all of these banks? yes, ripple ceo's both of them have lied on a few occasions but i feel it was more for marketing publicity. here's what it comes down to. decentralized vs centralized. many people are getting upset because ripple isn't using the blockchain for what it is. the counter question to that is does that really matter? the blockchain can be used however the user intends it to be used. i'm sorry to say, i have relatives in italy and i can send money in emergencies in 3-5 seconds to help them through this, to me that is solving a problem.	1
i promised i would update the community here when xrp became live through [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) it is now live and can be purchased direct with fiat. their visa cards are also not far behind as a means to cash out. the app is slightly cheaper than coinbase when purchasing in my experience. cheers &#x200b; enjoy the easy buying :) &#x200b; [https://crypto.com/en/index.html](https://crypto.com/en/index.html)	2
"so the title basically sums it up but here's my reasoning: hype is a *terrible* thing, especially in an insular, bleeding-edge market still shy of its first major large investor run in. and all it does is give more weight to speculation that can then be struck down and negatively affect not only the price but the optics of the asset. *we've seen this happen many times and it frankly shocks me that we haven't learned the following:* **1)** if an article makes a claim of partnership or new deals, it had better have a named or first hand (document, audio recording, photo evidence, video evidence) source. otherwise, consider it bullshit and irrelevant to either the price/asset. **2)** ok cool so they have a source of information, is that source valid? is there a way to check the reputation and legitimacy of this source? (post history, affiliations, legal filings, business dealings, donors, etc) **3)** and even after all that, simply because things can be edited with freightening ability nowadays in all forms of media, you have to ask yourself for final confirmation: **""is this true because i want it to be? or is this true because it makes sense and has reason to happen given the evidence?""** of course we're pro ripple and/or pro xrp so we have our clear biases, which is exactly why that question needs to be asked, and then you sorta have to ask that of the site, and really check the site's biases and their history of reporting. i've seen these rumour posts blow up all over reddit, twitter, and even in some xrpchat threads and it's not at all a good thing. and a lot of the time, it comes from either oracletimes or ripplenews (i dare you, read any recent article claiming a big scoop from them, run it through the above criteria and see how you feel) ***tl;dr*** in the face of crypto news and rumors, ask yourself: **1) what's the goddamn source?** **2) is that source even *remotely* credible?** **3) does this ""fact"" make sense or am i/the website just too biased?** and furthermore, ***oracletimes and ripplenews are fake news 9 times out of 10.***"	1

so imagine that we are in a pre-automobile and pre-highway era. there are two major cities 80 miles apart. with a horse and buggy it would take 3-5 days to traverse. a new technology comes in (automobiles/xrp) that would drastically decrease the time needed to travel to 1 hour, however there needs to be a highway in place for the car to travel as cars cannot travel through rough terrain. horse and buggies are still the prominent way to travel between the two cities. automobiles are considered a fringe technology. ​ now imagine the first highway (xrapid) was built between the two major cities. when it first opens, there is no traffic. only 30 people travel between the cities per day. the first adopters of automobiles will have the road to themselves and reap the benefits. **over time**, others will notice how much faster it is to use cars and the highway to travel. more and more buy cars and use the highway. now it is up to 300 people traveling between the cities per day -- still, barely any traffic. over time, the ones that use cars will be able to be much more productive and profit from the decreased travel time. this is when shit gets real. ​ profit-seeking individuals will start opening businesses based on the new technology and make huge gains, drawing more profit-seeking individuals to join. eventually, the highway becomes congested. it still takes 1 hour for travel, but now there are 58,900 people traveling per day between the cities. ​ now imagine the price of xrp at each moment was the toll booth's revenue per day. with each person, the toll booth collects 1 cent. only when there is a high volume of consistent travelers will a high price be maintained. volume will increase and decrease between days and months, but **to have a consistently high volume, profit-seeking individuals need to see the benefits of (i.e. how they can** ***profit*** **from) the new technology.** ​ tl;dr xrapid and sbi going live is a necessary but insufficient step for xrp volume to increase. how long will it take to create businesses and start producing big profits from using xrp? that's how long it will take for volume to reach its full potential. ​ \--> i realize the analogy is not 100% correct but it's mainly to say that we should celebrate when ripple opens corridors/builds highways, but should expect time between when it is built and when volume increases. we should all be excited to see what new businesses emerge in the future because of these technologies. that is what will ultimately drive up volume.	1

"roughly 8 months ago today i was sat hovering over the buy xrp button. i researched what ripple's mission was and the partnerships they had and decided i was going to invest in xrp. this was at about $0.16. at this time there was a lot of negative press towards ripple and xrp, much like there was towards btc at the start of it's existence. we sat through critics saying crypto is used by criminals, blockchain has no purpose and we tolerated the lynch mobs against anyone who even mentioned xrp in the cryptocurrency subreddit. today we're at just under x5 the price we were at 8 months ago and the massive amounts of growth from ripple is insane. 132 partnerships with companies using xcurrent & xrapid. holding steady at 3rd by market cap in the listings, new partnerships announced on a weekly basis. we should be proud of the progress ripple have made and their apparent ""we can do anything"" attitude only spurs me on as an investor. thanks **ripple**."	1
let’s not kid ourselves. it’s now obvious that ripple has the undivided attention of many of the world’s leading banks, money transfer conglomerates and other assorted financial institutions. the western union trial is just the latest in a series of trial announcements. the people in the know are completely aware that western union are downplaying this trial announcement. blind freddy can see that xcurrent and xrapid will save unimaginable levels of time and money. western union see themselves as the world leaders in money transfer so if their goal is to hold onto this standing and continue to have the prestige as number one, then an xrp-powered western union app is just around the corner. lock it in. there isn’t a financial company on earth foolish enough to not look into what all of this ripple fuss is about. the trial announcements that we’ve been hearing about have been in the pipeline for months, or even years. people need to understand that crypto is new, and companies are afraid of change...and they understand that their customers are even more skeptical of change. this is why these announcements are being trickled out to the general public. it’s highly likely that these deals are already done and that a number of communications and marketing teams are introducing their customer base to the idea of crypto / xrp in a gentle and drip-feed fashion. the non-crypto-understanding world needs time to process the change that is coming...and it’s coming like a tidal wave. with this is mind, it’s my personal opinion that we are highly likely to receive news that paypal is trialling the use of xrp in the very near future. first will be the rumour, then a memo or phone call transcript will be leaked. paypal will then come out and say that they have decided to trial the use of xcurrent or xrapid, with an undisclosed end date on the trial. when this happens, be ready for such a sudden and sharp rise in the value of xrp, that it will demand the world financial community’s attention. when paypal announce an xrp-powered product, the world will change and those who hold xrp will be rewarded for their good judgement. if none of the above has already transpired, then paypal are just delaying the inevitable. they either use the fastest and cheapest form of money transfer in the world’s history...or paypal (and any company that values making and saving money), will eventually cease to exist.	1
xrp is getting huge attention mainstream, and its vital that we as a community help the new ones to get settled when they come here to ask questions. the masses are what causing xrp to rise and stand green in a sea of blood. i try my best help when users are questions, hope everyone else also can chip in. this is a very important factor in our growth nowadays. #xrpthestandard	2
https://xrpcommunity.blog/the-fun-factor-promoting-xrp-adoption-and-usage/ investing in crypto is not like other financial efforts; unlike mainstream investing, each supporter of individual crypto networks can actually make a difference in getting the word out. whether you're a current proponent of other networks or not, you may be interested to learn what the massive community behind xrp is doing to help promote its adoption and use through our own marketing efforts. included in this blog is a list of xrp youtubers, along with background information on the new xrp community blogging site. i hope you enjoy the read & please leave any feedback below. thanks & sincerely, -hodor	1
$80 billion banco santander uses ripple for payments, will many banks follow? https://www.ccn.com/80-billion-banco-santander-uses-ripple-for-payments-will-many-banks-follow/	1
kotak mahindra bank (kotak) has joined ripple’s leading enterprise blockchain network (ripplenet) to provide impetus to its inward cross-border remittances. kotak will use ripple’s settlement solution, xcurrent, to provide its customers with real-time cross-border transactions in a safe and secure manner. xcurrent will enable kotak to reduce the average time associated with remittance payments, to minutes, versus several days, instantly settling cross-border payments and tracking the entire transaction process from end-to-end. the lower fees associated with xcurrent payments also make regular, small inward payments possible at a better rate for kotak customers.	1

earlier this week i wrote a post about how i bought xrp with 0 fees. it was a one page process describing every step of the process and even providing insights on should we prefer sepa vs swift transfers. in my opinion the whole process is very easy and takes less than 5 minutes. &#x200b; however, people wrote to me that they would rather pay 5% fee than go through all this. this sounds absurd to me and i do not understand it but i accept it. &#x200b; there are people who are being put off by the complexity of the process, who are scared that if they get one symbol wrong they will lose their money. these people are willing to pay more in order to get a better and simpler service. &#x200b; you might ask, where are these people right now? why are they not buying xrp right now when coinbase finally added xrp? i believe that the answer is that these people are obviously not tech-savvy. which means that their decisions about whether to buy a particular cryptocurrency or not is based primarily on fomo or other people's advices. &#x200b; my conclusion: when the market becomes bullish, it will be much easier for people to spend their money and they will. much more than what we have seen. &#x200b; so it is our duty as hodlers to sell the value of our cryptocurrency to those who cant see it themselves. get them to know what cryptocurrencies are about, show them what the future will look like, make them believe that they can be part of something big, help them experience the highs and the lows, the long consolidating hours, the hype, the hate. give them this hope for a miracle, i think people nowadays need that more than anything else, even money. &#x200b; edits: formating and wording	1

ripple[ has just implemented](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/commit/e07fa119233188463a9c98c5ece7bf45f90e8a41) a maximum fee for every transaction in its api. its default value is 2 xrp but can be optionally overridden. this may help to prevent situations like the xrp burn we saw last week.	1
western union + moneygram + cuallix + mercuryfx + idt + flashfx + 1 more money transfer company have already early access on xrapid which is still on beta and hasn't launched yet. as the vp of product said, next month we will learn the dates about the official launch of xrapid. that's when the banks will come in.	1
looking at other coins fomo hits us now and then. now with xrp around $2.80 our hands might start itching to sell and move funds to other coins. as such i like to remind myself that moving funds might not be the best idea now because: - 2 household names not released yet - q4 report coming up - a lot of people waiting on their verification at bitstamp for example - most fomo inducing coins don't have a working product - new exchanges please add. i'm feeling weak.	1
"i think ripple needs to do a commercial. if anyone from the ripple team reads this, as an investor in xrp, i'd love to help you craft the image of xrp. you ready? here's my pitch. guy drives up in a lambo. van halen's ""running with the devil"" blasting from it. it comes to a screeching halt. he slowly stumbles out with thick gold chains in ridiculous expensive clothes and sunglasses. he is bitcoin. brad or someone else representing ripple approaches him. ripple - hi bitcoin! bitcoin - are you the valet? 'cause i'm in a hurry. ripple - no, i'm ripple. bitcoin - ripple? never heard of you. ripple - we're a digital currency. bitcoin - i'm the king of digital currencies. ripple - you certainly are. but we're really fast. bitcoin - faster than bitcoin? i have a lambo, dude. ripple - i see that. how about i send you $1 in ripple and you send me $1 in bitcoin and we see who gets it faster? bitcoin - i'll bet my lambo bitcoin gets there faster. ripple - okay. ready? 3-2-1 go. (inside joke here for ripple fans) they both take out their smartphones. a few seconds later bitcoin's phone dings. screen shows ""you've just received $1 in ripple xrp. bitcoin's face drops. smash cut to a graphic that reads ""6 hours later"" ripple is still waiting. bitcoin looks nervous. bitcoin - look, it's gonna get there man. i swear. ripple - does it normally take this long? bitcoin - sometimes longer. ripple's phone finally dings. ripple - oh wait, here we go. bitcoin - see! i told you. the screen says ""you've just received 80 cents in bitcoin"". ripple - you only sent me 80 cents? bitcoin - i sent $1. bitcoin has fees. ripple - high fees and you're slow? bitcoin - can i please keep my lambo? ripple - for now. then cut to a voiceover that says, ""ripple. when you want your money in seconds anywhere in the world at any time. all of your money.
