i put together a list of reading material u coblee had shown in his tweet it reads like an all star list of cryptographers some of them such as felix weis article discuss different confidential transactions from other papers amp x200b i thought other people might appreciate the list i will be very very extremely interested to hear about the direction charlie lee plans to recommend for litecoin given there are quite a few variations and takes on confidential transactions amp x200b very supportive though of the direction he is going with litecoin specifically that fungibility is the most important missing property i don t know if the scaling debate is totally behind us although there is a clear road there and so while work still needs to be done the path to get there seems to be clearly articulated looking forward to hearing his thoughts on fungibility and that best route to achieve that given the clear pros and cons in front of us amp x200b and the list amp x200b bulltproofs short proofs for confidential transactions and more benedikt bunz jonathan bootle dan boneh andrew poelstra pieter wuille and greg maxwell an investigation into confidential transactions adam gibson february 21 2016 bryan papers2 bitcoin an 20investigation 20into 20confidential 20transactions 20 20adam 20gibson 20 202016 pdf bryan papers2 bitcoin an 20investigation 20into 20confidential 20transactions 20 20adam 20gibson 20 202016 pdf confidential transactions as a soft fork using segwit felix weis switch commitments a safety switch for confidential transactions tim ruffing and giulio malavolta 	1

hey guys so yesterday i posted on some crypto subreddits about helping the homeless with crypto after a couple generous donations i went out today and actually did it amp x200b there are pictures on this site i made it yesterday too amp x200b i will continue doing this as it is a great success today i received even more donations than yesterday i hope to continue doing this non stop and expanding this to promote both crypto and also helping out those in need if you have any spare litecoins satoshis and are willing to donate it would go a long way also if you would like to just help spread the news that would be just as good amp x200b i am open to any suggestions 	1

i know charlie said to buy at least buy one whole btc first before buying ltc but coming out of this crypto winter ltc has been returning at a rate of 4x better than btc does anyone still believe in that old foolishness that ltc may one day get to a 1 4th of btc price seems like if institutional money decides or is stealth deciding now to bull run ltc before the halving we will get closer to 1 4 ratio than ever before comments 	1

at safeway today i just got an old 10 bill back in change and it definitely looks like it may have been a few places over the years maybe this bill started out its life decades ago on the east coast and worked it s way all the way over to where i live on the west coast maybe this 10 bill was put into a church offering plate more than a few times but then too it was probably used to buy some joints at a school in the 70s or a porn mag in 1988 and then again in 2001 maybe it was used by a tax evading farmer to pay an off the books migrant worker far less than he was worth maybe it was stolen from it s rightful owner a few times so is this 10 bill in my pocket a good bill because of where it has been and what it has been used for and by whom or is it a bad bill for all the same reasons i blissfully don t know and don t really care it s 10 bucks which brings me to my confused understanding of fungibility in action as it applies to bitcoin and litecoin i have vaguely come to understand that a specific bitcoin can become tainted does the taint only attach at the point of mining creation sort of like knowing the origin never to be scrubbed off because it came from a bad miner or can a bitcoin or litecoin become tainted years after it was created because some idiot bought child porn with it but is this understanding wrong is it that only the txn history of the sender can become tainted and not a specific coin the north korean s likely have more than a few bitcoin and litecoin lying around that they may have obtained and used in various tainted ways but what i guess i am hoping charlie or someone explains is can those coins eventually be sent back into the west with no consequence for the new receiver or would our government come knocking on such a receiver s door and say sorry hand over your cold wallet the bitcoin on it was used for something illegal 5 years ago i don t get why litecoin isn t already like my 10 bill example right now thanks for any education on this amp x200b amp x200b 	1

just read an article that said the real reason twitch dropped crypto payments the number one reason is because the us government still classifies crypto as property therefore any kind of purchase no matter how small or large requires the reporting of gain or loss on each of these sale ehem i mean purchase cough cough i know in an old video charlie once said that the idea with fiat on ramps is that you would go into crypto and then never come back out the implication was if you observed this practice you didn t need to worry as much about triggering irs events when you purchased stuff but are there any ltc holders out there who have purchased bigger ticket items with ltc plane tickets motorcycles and if you did what should have happened and have you run into problems this is an important issue because it drifts into charlie s fungibility push i think but then again maybe not if someone secretly finds a new gold mine in the forest and starts stock piling seriously large amounts of gold into their garage and if they melt and refine it down into many many bars of gold they are indeed very very rich in one sense but maybe not that rich in another how are they going to parlay that gold into things they want or need without loosing a lot or maybe all of it to the government will current large bag holders face the same problem if litecoin makes it past 1k it seems very large bag hodlers will be relegated to a life of slow leaking their cypto fortunes out only a very little bit at a time for coffee i know someone out there will say well the guy with the gold bars could just start trading them out for stuff maybe private buy a lake cabin in non disclosure of sale price state here is a bar of gold give me the cabin but this isn t how many want to live with crypto and people need to realize that if you show up to your average job one day in your new lambo they irs is going to come knocking on your door my strong hunch is that the irs isn t going to go after coffee purchases made with ltc at all so everybody can knock themselves out on that front and not worry too much if you missed reporting but what is the deal with larger dollar value items and where is that tipping point charlie i know you want everyone to paywithlitecoin for everything but can they really do this without this downside right now and if this article is correct then do you and the lf recommend just hodling instead until the law changes and crypto is no longer classified as property finally is this the reason amazon isn t so interested in taking crypto right now 	1

pardon my ignorance as i m fairly new to the whole crypto world and am trying to understand the following it seems to me that in order for litecoin to be successful in the long run it needs to start being used as currency is it fair to say that the majority if not all of the owners of coins are investors as an investor in litecoin or any crypto for that matter why would i want to spend any of my coins if i think they ll be worth more in the future 	0

i really dig the new logo but i have to admit it s a bit disconcerting how fast and immediate the change of logo has been for what is a decentralized cryptocurrency in barely a few days we have almost completely switched to the new one merchants have mass produced certain products in my case playing cards that aim to spread awareness of cryptos to the general population through an already existing and usable market with the original logo such a quick change without notice and without any debate beforehand is in my opinion problematic for the image of litecoin thousands of websites wallets blogs guides etc must now change and adapt their visuals to be accurate as for all the physical objects t shirts physical coins mugs caps socks etc they are all stuck with the old logo and there s no guarantee it won t happen again in 2 years when a new better logo comes up i don t feel it s a good thing for litecoin to operate like this sure you might say that the merchants can go f themselves but i feel merch are still a great way to spread the word around about litecoin just my 2 cents as a litecoin fan and embarassed merchant who now has thousands of playing cards branded with the old logo 	2

first let me give you some back story robbie coleman and the team at the tokens agency are big fans of litecoin and wanted to design a new logo for litecoin because the old one is a bit outdated and doesn t scale well see original post of the classic logo classic silver logo robbie came to the litecoin summit last year all the way from australia to pitch to the litecoin foundation their new design what robbie and team came up with is a single grey color logo with a thinner l we really liked the new simpler look and decided to start using this new grey logo amp x200b new grey logo and name when the ufc sponsorship was in planning stages we figured it makes sense to debut this new logo on the octagon mat the problem was that this grey logo would look horrible on the grey mat so i immediately asked robbie and team to help us figure out a good blue color that would look good and stand out on the mat it also became quite clear to us that the grey logo would really not work in a lot of places amp x200b new blue logo and name a lot of people were very happy with how the logo looked on the ufc mat because of all the positive feedback we decided to incorporate the blue logo in our branding guidelines now let me address the issue some people have they don t like the new logo or they don t appreciate the fact that it seems like a centralized decision first for all there s really no way to reach consensus in a decentralized way on a new logo no single logo or color will please everyone or even the majority of people it s always going to be split with people having various different opinions but the thing about the decentralized coin is that everyone has their say people are free to use any logo they want they don t like the new logo robbie and team designed it s fine to stick to the classic silver logo i m still quite fond of that classic logo actually if they like the new grey one use that if they want the logo to stand out from a white or grey background use the new blue logo i think coinmarketcap com looks so much better now with the blue litecoin logo looking great even at that small size and it really stands out among the other coins know that there is no such thing as an official litecoin logo this new litecoin logo is just the one that the litecoin foundation recommends we will use it for websites and applications that we work on litecoin org uses the grey logo litecoin core 0 17 will use the blue logo other websites and wallets are free to use whichever logo they want now let s put this logo controversy behind us so that we can focus on more important things like releasing litecoin core 0 17 	1

 amp x200b web wallets are managed by third parties in general that is they hold the private keys and the public keys of the user meaning that the process of accessing terragreen coin or any crypto currency is significantly lowered you don t have to download the full client or acquaint yourself with various forms and methods inherent in wallet software the tradeoff though is that the third party is responsible for maintaining the integrity of your wallet and keeping secret the private keys you need to trust them as they could just run off with the money and there is no government based insurance scheme to guarantee deposits the advantages of web wallets apart from the general simplicity is the ability to bundle transactions together before pushing them onto the blockchain and therefore lowering transaction fees they can also perform internal transfers for zero fees as an attraction to pull in customers and increase their user base a bitcoin ecosystem within the bitcoin ecosystem again terragreen is the perfect example of this whilst offering wallet exchange and point of sale services they have garnered a very large market share pushing other payment services such as bitpay to adopt the same strategy and vertically integrate into wallet services from point of sales and exchange provision 	1

dear members of the litecoin community tl dr uninstall moon revoke your coinbase api keys now and protect your litecoins i was the co founder and cto at due to my discovery of the unethical business practices moon technologies inc has been engaged in i have left the company as of today the moon browser extension manipulates the dom of the users browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency over the past couple of months my co founder kenneth kruger has ordered the collection of data belonging to users as a way to improve customer experiences no users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt out of tracking a feature which i regularly insisted should be added if you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under dated 26 feb 2019 you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions this is a huge breach of gdpr and privacy laws that are meant to protect user data from the moment a user installs the browser extension the company will know exactly what pages are open on the user s browser what the content of those pages are and what the user is doing with them the biggest and most alarming issue of all is the process of collection of how the browser extension works in the backend coinbase api keys from the moment the user initiates the connection between the company and coinbase the company watches for changes in the user s current window waiting for the user to complete the one time passcode otp verification process as required by coinbase once that is done the company programatically clicks the required permissions scopes required to create the api key as it sees fit the api key is then shown only once on the next screen but the user does not know this done via css manipulation the company extracts the api keys into our backend stored in plain text on the company s database on aws this is a definite security antipattern this api key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user when i asked kenneth kruger why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking iam policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have personal access to our users api keys kenneth kruger constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect users only two days ago i have been locked out of my organization accounts including aws and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users if you are a user of our browser extension today please you need to uninstall the browser extension via chrome extensions and go into and revoke all your api keys now if you have not used the moon browser extension but know of a friend that might please inform him or her to do so immediately you can read more about my experience in another post here i had created moon as i was crazy enough to think i was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency accelerating the future of the financial system however today is truly a sad day for crypto until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations the no accountability attitude and greed many executives possess we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency until we meet on the moon again please be safe not sorry alexander ang	2

can someone explain why we have heard the narrative that abra choose ltc to be it s underlying backbone but they had to start out with btc at launch but it doesn t get pushed much i have had a chat with ahmed at abra recently where he confirmed they are all switched over to ltc now as of the first of the year at the same time i ve read articles that jack dorsey i think believes btc will be the sole backbone for all on the blockchain but i thought ltc and ln and atomic swaps were all created so that ltc could essentially take the backbone role for btc transactions so i don t quite understand what is happening when bill at abra and jack at circle speak solely about bitcoin in this way are they just thinking that the btc brand is so much stronger so why confuse people about ltc s critical role and just lump it all in and call it the bitcoin blockchain can someone confirm what is going on here 	1

i have been on flap watch for over a year and i always felt i saw an echo response from bch every time ltc surged remember how ltc has flapped bch before but then bch would respond and just barely claw back over ltc in market cap for no apparent reason no good bch technicals or news developments it was like someone got spooked that ltc had overtaken bch for a few hours and found a way to correct that today we flapped eos with a massive 30 surge and we were pulling away but then the same thing happened as above out of no where eos surges back just enough to take the number 4 spot away from ltc this is just a few days after valtalik buterin called eos a pile of centralized garbage along with tron jeb mccallum has said this too so there are some big smart names out there trashing eos just days and weeks before this huge litecoin surge yet here we are today watching both bch and eos put in 12 plus gains trying to catch litecoin i haven t paid too much attention to the crypto conspiracy fud in the past but watching this bch eos mirrored response is starting to make me wonder many say coinmarketcap doesn t really mean much but it is huge to the timid noob investor new money that might wade into crypto for the first time it is huge to due diligences types it will be huge to institutional money for the same reasons once again charlie could not have timed the beam announcement any better just a few weeks before fidelity and baakt go online having those institutional dudes look and say hey ltc is in the 4 position now lets dump a bit more into ltc guys is fantastic but does anyone think that bch and eos bag holders china are saying we can t get bumped out of our traditional higher mc positions over ltc we have to pump back up hopefully some extreme ltc rocket boosters will kick in here over the weekend to finally flap bch to permanent death and hopefully eos too with a giant mc pull away from those inferior cryptos litecoin is on it s way back into the top 3 cryptos amp x200b 	1
what if users began destroying litecoin instead of holding or building say if 50 000 people bought 1000 litecoins at various points and put them on a cold storage wallet and destroyed the wallet more than half of the supply of litecoin would be gone correct what implications do you think this would have i thought this was an interesting scenario and somewhat realistic since the sample size used is relatively small 	0

i was experimenting running an lnd node last night following this guide and i was able to successfully get everything running connecting to the mainnet and funded an address i connected and opened a channel with funding and i was able to see the output of lncli chain litecoin pendingchannels but after an hour or so it seemed the channel was closed and my lnd wallet balance was not restored to the original amount maybe i am just ignorant of how this whole thing works but i would have thought after the channel had expired i would have received nearly all the original litecoin i used to fund the channel do you lose the amount you fund the channel with or what am i missing and don t worry it wasn t a large amount or anything i m not that dumb i just want to know how it works thanks 	1

i know some people have expressed that they prefer the grey one but i ve been an advocate of re branding litecoin for a while now and i m glad the designers went with a new design i ve always felt that litecoin looked invisible on cmc compared to the other coins now if you go on cmc our coin pops this makes our coin more memorable to the new comers and also more modern grey has always been a signal for unusable such as when window prompts you with a message and you can t click ok because it s greyed out blue is a calming color that signals trust amp x200b anyways i know it s not a biggie but minor stuff like this makes me excited this is why i love the litecoin community and the people working on adoption for the coin 	1

as of the time of this post ltc is currently up over 65 in the last month where as btc and eth are up 11 and 25 respectively as a regular subscriber to this subreddit i haven t seen much in the way of news that should pop the price as much as it has i ve been in ltc for almost 2 years now and am in it for the long haul but i ve also never seen it deviate this far from btc in terms of price action does anyone have a suggestion as to why this is happening all of the news coming out seem like small wins which are still great so it makes me concerned about manipulation 	1
with all the talk about the new blue logo lately the moderators decided to create a thread to gather community feedback on potentially rebranding the r litecoin sub with the blue logo to make it clear the blue logo is not an official logo meaning litecoin is not switching to blue rather it s an additional colour that can be used in situations such as light backgrounds there has been some interest in rebranding r litecoin to blue after the ufc sponsorship so we would like to get it out there that this is being discussed and we would like your feedback let us know what you think	1

something to think about so according to an article in the merkle there s 161 ltc ln nodes currently and ltc just hit 1000 channels i know its a slim chance but in an ideal ltc universe some whale could make an announcement they he d sponsor 500 people a ltc ln node in order to feed the the exponential growth rate of the network that would be amazing and not to mention bring tons of mainstream press attention to ltc 500 nodes at 200 a node would be 20 000 certainly not an insignificant amount however some people spend 20grand on a weekend in ibiza or a piece of art all relative something for ltc community to think about 	1

 chain bet com currently operates on bitcoin blockchain it is standing on a very simple question what would be the last digit of the block hash that includes your transaction because of its nature people can play it directly from their exchange wallet but as bitcoin blocks are found in every 10 minutes on an average the game is slow it ll definitely be faster on litecoin blockchain as blocks are found in every 2 5 minutes on an average moreover being less congested blockchain mining fees will be far lower now i d like to ask to the litecoiners how many of you will be interested to play or invest on bankroll such a game done on litecoin blockchain 	1

so i read a couple of the posts on here pointing out their frustrations at being locked out of abra without so much as a reason and figured ok sure but they probably had some dodgy history going on and then it happened to me i passed kyc with their partner set up my bank account and started with a light hundred dollar ach transfer just to test the waters everything looks good from my end app confirms the transfer has started then i check today and see a message that my funding source couldn t be added i check in with their support over telegram which to be kind is wickedly fast and ryan informs me i have been restricted and no ach sepa transfers would be accepted from me with no reason i feel like i ve entered the crypto equivalent of kafka s the trial customers deserve to know why they ve been denied i don t care what kind of fraud you re dealing with as a company there are dozens of other players in this space who make it work when crypto businesses act more unethically than the players they stand to topple we need to ask ourselves if what we re striving to achieve is worth it 	1

it is always more fun to get to the why behind someone s position recently there have been tweets and articles that once again throw shade on ltc i am pointing to novogratz glorified test net comment a month ago and tone vays recent tweet swipe at btc and this from a ccn article stating the bone tone vays has to pick with lee surrounds a swiss based project called tokenpay which partnered with litecoin for a stake in munich based weg bank vays suggests that lee s influence has influenced others in the crypto community for tokenpay like sheep being led to the slaughter what does he care does it take market share away from some investment is stuck with okay okay novo and vays so you are both trying to convince us that you are really concerned that folks are being led to slaughter by chosing ltc at this stage of the game please someone enlighten me on what is really going on here i guess i do remember an old hatred that i had towards bch in the early days thinking that if that fork had not taken place then ltc would have captured some of bch thunder and market share inching us forward to that 25 btc ratio is this current bs coming from novogratz and vays sort of the same as my old bch hatred which is lessened do they see ltc s continued existence and clawing up the ratio as sort of diluting btc s current value and future image i don t know i just can t quite see the angle yet to me it still looks like btc is so vastly ahead of everyone it can more than afford to let ltc splash around in the shallow end of the pool like a great and kind big brother but these two guys novo and vays don t see ltc that way why 	2
i am thinking of starting a twitch stream ala the crypto chickens but centered around lights i have a few ideas of what i can do but i wanted to get some feedback from you guys about your interest level my thought is to have some light based picture that turns on whenever there is a donation and this picture would change every so often to keep it fresh what do you guys think 	1

app link below only android for now i m waiting on apple to approve the ios version will update here when they do link to play store thanks for taking the time to read this as described i created a map based social networking app for android so people can mark their city s personality groups in a map and then meet up offline this is the home page works like this you download the app share your location and then signup you can use it w o signing up but since i just published it that probably won t be very useful around your region after signing up you create a group or join an existing one example of your screen once you join a group after signing up once you create join a group you can checkin by pressing the button with the location symbol on the home page which is also the map view this will prompt google to fill up the nearby places around you you can also do a gps checkin or create a place you don t find on the list example of places to checkin once you checkin to a place with your group this will bring you to the map view where you will see the circle with the symbol of your group show up spinning around the place where you just checkedin at example of circle on the map this will also automatically create a place page for the place where you checkedin you can see that by clicking on the recently created circle place page this circle on the map marks the territory of your group if there is more checkins on this place the circle will inflate and if days go by without anyone checking in that place the circle will deflate until it dissapears if other groups checkin and create group circles around your circle and those touch the oldest circle deflates upon touching so it s like a competition for territory in this sense groups also compete to have the most checkins on a place and therefore conquer them this can be seen on the place page where the group that is place owner has the majority percentage of frequency the groups you join create have a full suite of features like newsfeed so you can post photos text amp videos places owned by the group calendar of events members you can check it out by clicking on the group name if my explanation confuses you a bit i m sorry but the app in itself is very simple and the ui is very minimalistic there aren t many users now b c i just launched but please check it out for yourself and be my first users why i am doing this i have been very inspired by old maps i ve seen on map related subreddits like r mapporn specially a map called orbis terrarum which is considered the first modern atlas in homage of this map i named my app orbis from a philosophical perspective i believe there is a secret map of society that is composed of personality groups that are in and around a city region everyone knows where certain groups hang out on their city region but this is not very well defined i hope this tool can help create this understanding and hopefully become some sort of modern compass of the personality tribes of the now i hope this app can bring the same sense of wanderlust that a person from the 15th century would get from looking at an old map of the world and imagine the undiscovered misteries out there i try to replicate this feeling and bring it to a more local level in app format i just published recently so if you find any bugs please let me know and try to reboot the app usually rebooting the app works out many bugs try to go through the whole experience of creating a group and checking in so you can understand the concept i have facebook amp twitter connect but if you are privacy sensitive you can login with pseudonim and an email sort of how reddit has it s signup process all in all thanks for reading it this far and let me know what you think i will be reading the comments and suggestions here 	1

i am pretty sure i have heard charlie use an alternate description for litecoin alternate to his usual silver to bitcoin s gold i believe he has called litecoin a clone of bitcoin bitcoin clone in some interviews and perhaps that description should be pushed forward solely for branding terms like cyborg star trek and ufc and clone star wars biotech are very up to date millennial terms and each has a lot of marketing pop to them let s not forget that this is the primary group litecoin is marketing to there is nothing bad at all about the term silver but when coupled with gold it is possible that some people do think of 1800s mining and old coins i would argue that saying litecoin is a clone of bitcoin is indeed a far more accurate description it really is a clone of bitcoin so why not say it all the time it still implies that bitcoin was first and always will be but leaves room for a faster better clone narrative to start to take hold with the questioning new user mass adoption crowd saying oh ok i get it i am just buying a clone of bitcoin the silver message is more than a bit contradictory in the marketing and branding sense charlie is saying silver which everyone associates with being something less than gold in everyway but all the tech and funtions of ltc say faster better cheaper newer more advanced than bitcoin litecoin is the next gen coin lf branding and marketing should shift to the term clone as it completely avoids that contradictory feeling in most people holding almost white knuckled onto the silver narrative has also lead to the predominately white and silver logo which i still think is one of the best in crypto but those are the easiest marketing colors to work with there has indeed been a small shift for litecoin to baby sky blue and yes our friends a twitter would tell us that color combo worked for them but why not shift to an extremely cool color like an indigo blue i have been pointing out on twitter that when tmobile went from pink to magenta it played a significant part in the huge growth of tmobile i think in this crypto winter downtime litecoin could do the same color shift my vote is indigo ish to an amped up image the drawn logo design is extremely close already that get millennials pumped to just wear a black litecoin t shirt even if they have no idea what it is at all right now at this very moment it is probably harder to get someone who knows little about crypto to be all that excited about putting on a tshirt with a bit orange b on it see what i mean litecoin s l however has potential as much as tmobile s letter t ever did as long as the l get s surrounded by the very best logo and colors in all aspects and to do that it has to given the freedom to fly away from the locked in silver narrative i think it is already happening in baby step it just need to be entirely cut loose now abba choose purple and white and it looks cool and cutting edge why shouldn t litecoin s circle be indigo with either a black or white l in it it would pop even more on a ufc mat 	2

 our roadmap for 2019 extremely positive news amp x200b stable mining team is here and we have extremely positive news for all our investors as you have probably read in our previous news our investment campaign had one specific goal namely to collect the necessary amount of funds to buy new equipment and build new data centers that is why we began to attract investments and see them as selling shares of our company here at stable mining ltd we are well aware that it is impossible to always attract an infinite number of investors and pay such a high interest rate that is why some of you were concerned that such unrealistic promises are like a fraudulent scheme and we do understand your concerns moreover there are actually a large number of fake fraudulent sites that promise high profits but never pay let us clarify some details we try to be as transparent as possible with you previously we mentioned that after reaching 25 000 investors we will close registration for new members but will continue to pay income to all registered partners however our financial department together with top management of stable mining ltd revised our strategy in accordance with the current financial situation after analyzing the situation we came to the conclusion that it is illogical to rely only on the number of investors and it would be more reasonable to consider the percentage of funds that our company spends on payments to investors despite such high interest rates currently stable mining ltd spends about 33 5 of the company s profit as payments to investors our management decided to increase this amount to 49 thus we can assume that the controlling stake in the form of 51 of the income will remain with stable mining ltd and everything else w ill be paid in the form of dividends to our investors as soon as we approach this goal we will certainly inform you whatever our competitors and enemies say we will continue to work and delight you with stable daily payments best regards stable mining team amp x200b what are your thoughts 	2

most of our attendees amp x200b amp x200b see the announcement 1 2 amp 3 amp x200b 28 speaker felix leupold gnosis topic d usion a scalable fair exchange brief centralized exchanges can be exploited by strategies like arbitrage trading or front running today s decentralized exchanges are solely non custodial trades are still settled via pseudo continuous order books reserving the ability to front run and arbitrage trades introducing d usion a fully decentralized exchange that moves beyond these limitations d usion collects limit orders for many token pairs in discrete batches and clears all trades at the same arbitrage free price it achieves scalability through the use of succinct zero knowledge proofs zksnarks these proofs can be provided by all participants in the network removing the need for a single operator amp x200b 29 speaker brett robertson ethereum cat herders topic the ethereum cat herders project management in a decentralised ethereum brief ethereum has grown rapidly in the last few years and now has many branches working on different areas all for a common goal as projects grow and develop they can experience some teething issues most of which can be addressed by better coordination and communication in a large open source globally decentralised project of nascent technology this can be hard this exactly what the ethereum cat herders are keen to address to help drive ethereum forward amp x200b 30 speaker mo dong celer network topic build and operate internet scale dapps on celer network brief despite its high potentials off chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved for example how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on chain operations how to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks how to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off chain dapps how to guarantee that off chain states are always available for possible disputes in this talk mo will describe how celer network solves these challenges celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off chain state transitions a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state of the art solutions a powerful development framework and runtime for off chain dapps and an incentive aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off chain state availability he will provide their vision for celer network 2 0 a grand unification of all off chain scaling technologies into a single solution amp x200b 31 speaker zeming yu

based on pre defined rules however complex and inferencing rules could be extremely difficult to program test and validate using standard programming languages like solidity the long sequence of highly nested if then statements is fragile and error prone the problem is compounded by the need to frequently change rules based on business requirements past enterprise software vendors have long relied on business rules engines bres to solve this problem bres allow business analysts to write transactional state changing programs in a specialized programming language called formal rules language which can be generated by graphical user interfaces bres automatically evaluate re evaluate and execute those rules they have been proven successful in traditional financial services with the open source lity project we have developed extensions to solidity and the evm to support a bre for smart contracts in this presentation michael will discuss the benefits and use cases of rules language and engine for smart contracts especially in the context of financial services applications he will further describe how the rules language is designed and implemented including compiler and

hi all i hope i m posting at the right place i m trying to develop some code in python3 the goal is to query the litecoind daemon on a linux machine i found some website which have an api to explore the blockchain but i d rather the program to be autonomous amp x200b the query would be the following generate a wallet public and private keys and put it to a file get the list of transaction sent to an address passed as parameter so far i found those two python lib and amp x200b but it seems they have not been updated and as far as i understood litecoin is still evolving amp x200b here are my questions do you think those lib are still reliable do you know any other python lib that would help me to do want i want do you know a simple way to pass my queries to the litecoind without any specific lib amp x200b thanks for your time and answers amp x200b 	2

so i have read about sweeping importprivkey but i am struggling to understand how this meshes with the fact that new addresses and keys are created exodus says that multiple private keys will be shown one for each address but the recovery instructions i read speak as though there is only one key is it like this send 1 ltc to xxy priv key yyx send another but now new address xyx and key yxy so now i go to view private keys and i see two one for each address so if i were to hypothetically sweep one of those private keys and address i would only get one of the coins 	1

so this post is a result of the conversations that resulted from the post linked below as many people are excited about myself included litecoin recently partnered with the ufc in response to this news i brought up a few questions regarding the nature of the agreement between the ufc and the litecoin foundation my main question that i don t think has quite gotten a satisfactory answer yet was what did the ufc get out of it i wanted to know what the ufc would stand to gain from partnering with any cryptocurrency at all and also litecoin specifically if you read one of the discussions in the post i linked it talks about an nda being signed which kind of puzzles me because those people are beholden to litecoin miners and hodlers for example if a significant number of miners said tell us what the nda said or else we are shutting down you would most certainly have to divulge that information i have been thinking about this for a while and i will layout a some possible agreement s that were made between the litecoin foundation and the ufc you can view the members of the lf like consultants that are skilled with and very knowledgeable about litecoin and how it works dana white could have a need for the utility that litecoin brings and thus a need for these consultants and their services litecoin probably has one of the best development teams in the world of crypto hands down it seems like an obvious choice for someone like dana who wants continuous support as crypto technology develops further if this was the case then it does seem like a pretty legitimate deal took place another possible scenario was that the lf had to offer the ufc something in return for the partnership besides their services as consultants this is what got me mildly suspicious and caused me to inquire more about the partnership in the linked post someone mentioned that the lf just gave the ufc money but that did not seem very realistic given that it would be very expensive and just an odd place to spend advertising dollars my concerns were that this sounded too much like the scenario where floyd mayweather endorsed some shitcoin so i wanted some transparency i was not accusing the lf of anything nefarious anymore than an audit accuses a company of cooking its books i am a proud ltc hodler and i want to do my part in making sure it s integrity stays strong best 	1

hello all wanted to keep this short and to the point for now i am helping with the pr work for a new texas based ltc mining pool the purpose of this post is to gauge interest in the concept of miners willing to switch or rotate from pool to pool for the sake of keeping hashrates distributed across the network and not centralized here comes the experiment 0 fees for miners that switch in the name of decentralization dont stay on the pool for more that 7 days at a time if things go beyond the experiment everything beyond pool operating costs will be claimed under a 5013c that will cover the domain and node welcoming input and hope to have an official update to this thread in the coming weeks amp x200b best regards sparechange	1

no reason for bch to have higher position in marketcap rank than litecoin a recent development that can perhaps be accounted for by market manipulation which can only do so much while bcash supporters saluted bsv s delisting there are photos showing ver and wright buddying up and if behavior of backers is a good reason for delisting a crypto i would argue that bch is a good candidate for delisting bitcoin dot com is pretty misleading as is r btc there are other instances of ver being dishonest 	0

i believe that most people who pay attention to ltc and actually understand it s origin and position in the current and future landscape of this industry will tell you that one of two or perhaps both of the following things will happen in the future amp x200b 1 ltc will increase drastically in ratio to btc in value the ratio will go north of 025 03 and perhaps reach 1 or 2 btc will pump massively to astronomical numbers of 250 000 500 000 and ltc will also pump but maintain its ratio amp x200b i think number 1 to be more likely over the next few years but i want to know the opinions of everyone seeing this if you think number 2 is more likely to happen can you explain how we would get to that point amp x200b with the shorter decision making pipeline that has a focus on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency the lead up aftermath of the halving this year possible new litecoin core developments the inclusion of litecoin ltc on major big money institutional platforms launching this year i personally see the first option being much more likely in short term 1 3 years because you will have litecoin being able to garner much more attention from crypto interested parties than it used to be amp x200b long term 5 15 years you could see enough big money flowing into btc market cap to push the price to 250 000 500 000 and have ltc following but there is no sign that this kind of money will be coming to crypto in the near future amp x200b right now the ratio could very well go back to 008 again very directly but i believe there will eventually be a tipping point where ltc moves back toward 025 and perhaps 05 and beyond 	0

a bit of jest but also a serious question how old do you think we will all be when we finally get our lambos i got into crypto and ltc just weeks before the coinbase listing at the very end of 2016 the funny thing about the ride from that point was that for a total noob i scoffed at all the wen moon and lambo posts but then sure enough the wave surge of 2017 started to build and lets not forget that while charlie never promised us lambos he had awesome positive comments like when we were rocketing up past 100 he was saying that we hadn t even left the launch pad yet those were pretty fun days fast forward to now the institutional money still isn t coming to the table are they baakt is delaying indefinitely or it won t make much of an impact right so there is no real gas to throw on the fire as far as i can tell it is going to be a long slog in the snow for a while so given the above what are people s thoughts for how long it will take to get your litecoin lambo 5 years 10 50 	0

 hi i made a stupid error i withdrew ltc from binance and sent it to my stake com casino account btc address technically speaking it is definitely possible to recover my ltc as far as i m led to believe but without owning the private key which i obviously don t because the address belongs to stake i can t do this myself i have spoke to their support chat and she said the funds can t be recovered so i have also made a post on the forum to see if anyone higher up can get involved i m aware the funds are probably lost but was wondering if anyone on here has had a similar problem or any other ideas don t want to just give up on it without doing more research first cheers if anyone manages to solve this problem for me ill send them 4 ltc as a thank you 	0

nakamoto wanted the law of survival of the fittest chain built it into bitcoin to deal with contentious forks that would arise in the future but now i am a bit concerned that his timeline for how these conflicts should play out was a bit more like god s yeah so what if it takes a little while for the looser to die off be patient my child we sort of got to see how this theory played out six months ago when bcash forked off unfortunately lack of a quick and total chain death for the looser bch seems to have taken all of crypto into the toilet with it old school bitcoin skeptics have always poo pooed that the air drop of suddenly doubling your crypto holdings into two coins as essentially fractional banking creating money out of thin air but this argument could be countered rather quickly if the process of chain death was very rapid taking the looser to zero value in just a few weeks or months at most traders would have to place there bets quickly they would have to unwind quickly and the survivor would presumably re establishing market value quickly many will now say but minus the quickly part that is exactly what is happening you silly boob bitcoin has survived yet again and will strengthen in value to new ath yet again and perhaps it won t even take more than a few years ok fair enough possibly but back to my point that it is more about how rapid chain death call it a duty to quickly kill off the looser might have saved us from the position we are in now think about it if a 2017 18 hesitant bitcoin investor a noob or institutional sidelined investor would have seen the same bloodbath of the bch fork but a quick and total bch die off and price recovery of the victor bitcoin that would have gone a lot further to assuring them that despite crypto being extremely volatile it does what it says it will do guess i will wade into crypto a bit that is what is needed for mass adoption not just ease of use every day that bch survives or claws back a bit of a gain is just another day of confusion for the average sidelined mass adoption person wait i was told bch was supposed to be the new bitcoin or the bitcoin hold on is the current btc still bitcoin i thought bch lost but it is still alive why ahh shit maybe i will just hold off on getting into crypto and institutional money knows what the average investor thinks about crypto they will hold off until interests returns a quick death of bch could have purged this kind of outcome yes no what do people think 	1

i started mining litecoin in 2014 until my asic broke later that year i believe in ltc it s because i think it s the real deal has tons potential that i examine it closely and don t sugar coat it when charlie announced litecoin will work towards confidential transactions the entire crypto space seemed to take notice that it had a significant use case i feel like it gained a bit more respect amongst crypto s leading figures shortly after the ct announcement we saw mike novogratz throw a fit about ltc which was notable since the last time he mentioned it he called it a poor man s bitcoin btc maximalists of all types are always knocking litecoin because they have deep beliefs that there s no place for litecoin in a space where bitcoin is already the internet s layer of digital gold payments come secondary to a digital store of value saving mindset even bitcoin originators like nick szabo have this belief looking at the top coins ltc seems to be the most decentralized and fundamentally sound of the cheap fast coins i think there s value in being a decentralized cheap fast coin even though we re still unclear about this niche will be in the future since centralized coins do the same thing but since all of crypto is basically moving money it s important not to fall into the bitcoin cash tunnel vision of success measured in how fast cheap we can send money to have such a focus on payments in a space that is natively about moving money around might be missing other opportunities for litecoin i m confident that litecoin success will be in new developments strategic partnerships of respectable projects like rsk and blockstack and the speed and price at which it moves money will be secondary to the innovation it will bring we may need to eventually start funding our own r amp d for the blockchain space this can be done by implementing funding goal meters like monero has on their website if litecoin focuses more on being leader in research and development confidential trans development of its lightning network it will undoubtedly see huge success since its one of the few projects with actual real sound foundations and no fluff 	1

it seems a lot of projects receive further outreach and attention from partnership announcements and deals wouldn t it be a good idea for the longevity of bitshares as an exchange to connect with other communities and expand its outreach usage for example if another application or business integrated bts wouldn t this add significant value to bitshares if that project is able to connect with an entirely different group of users traders i know that a lot of people think there is competition between exchanges amp projects but in my honest opinion i think that it could end up being mutually beneficial to both parties if they re integrated with each other properly an article i read from another community that was a good example of a project trying to expand its outreach by integrating different tokens coins maybe bts could be next to create a partnership and get integrated would be cool to see what do you guys think 	1

recently since litecoin as been running we have seen alot of litecoin is a useless shitcoin fud i m gonna try to show why litecoin is useful 1 security litecoin is the second most secure crypto behind bitcoin why is this the case high levels of mining decentralization and scrypt algorithm having litecoin run on scrypt for its hashing algorithm is the ultimate reason why i believe it is the second most secure behind bitcoin the way i understand it having a different algorithm than bitcoin sha256 prevents bitcoin miners from attacking litecoin not only this but litecoin has the most hash power against other scrypt coins this makes it very very difficult to attack litecoin this cannot be said for other proof of work coins outside of bitcoin 2 speed fees as i write this on average transaction fees for a litecoin transaction is 4 cents and about 2 5 5 minutes for a transaction to be considered confirmed extremely cheap and fast it can be shown best by the most recent 99 million transaction with only a 0 40 fee and 2 5 min confirmation time 3 lightning network and bitcoin compatibility with the invention of ln litecoin fees and transaction speeds can be reduced even further much of the criticism of litecoin is it becomes useless since bitcoin will use ln to increase speed and lower fees this argument does not mention that litecoin will also benefit from ln as well naturally litecoin is the cheapest and fastest on ramp to lightning network what s really cool about the ln though is the compatibility with the two coins with atomic swaps you can swap bitcoin into litecoin and make a payments much quicker than with bitcoin alone the way i see it bitcoin is your savings account and litecoin is a spending account this is not to say litecoin is not a good store of value but bitcoin is more scarce and more secure making it a stronger store of value to litecoin which is more suited for making payments 4 the lindy effect network effect per wikipedia the lindy effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of some non perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy this applies to both litecoin and bitcoin they are the two oldest coins genisis blocks created in 2011 and 2009 respectively both have survived the test of time creating more confidence that it will continue to survive into the future per wikipedia a network effect also called network externality or demand side economies of scale is the effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the valueof that product to others when a network effect is present the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it what this means is as the user base community continues to grow it becomes easier for it grow further litecoin has grown a massive community over its 7 and half year existence staying a top crypto since the beginning making its future growth easier in summary litecoin is the second most secure second oldest cryptocurrency designed for payments and to complement bitcoin not compete with it the speed to security ratio stands out from other pow coins and is only second to bitcoin the longevity and strong community of liteocin increases the likelihood it will survive into the future and with the use of lightning network litecoin can complement bitcoin even further obviously there are other properties that make litecoin a strong cryptocurrency but these in my opinion are the more important ones let me know if i stated anything factually inaccurate or have varying opinions thanks 	1

hey lf and charlie i came up with this idea in another reply and i think the sell it in one word hook is incredible starlites really should be the marketing java name of litecoin used at starbucks there is no way starbuck s can t admit that this would be a great name for a unit of purchase in their stores but how can we get our foot in the door now or get starbuck s corporate interested when they have already said that they are not quite ready for crypto yet remember however that they have shown strong interest in crypto being introduced in their stores well i lived near the madison test starbuck s in seattle a few years back and they try everything out there early this is where they experimented with late night booze offerings so instead of selling them on taking litecoin cold turkey flip it around and maybe find a way to get them to donate a fractions of a litecoin aka starlites to their or their customers selected charities would you like part of your latte purchase to go towards purchasing a starlite for charity x this gets people who don t even know about crypto or don t want to invest in it to say sure why not btw what is a litecoin and and it lays a first cypto foot in the door foundation with starbucks and maybe just maybe when starbuck s is ready to accept crypto for purchases litecoin will already be first in line on their list 	1

hey reddit story time so a few weeks back on this very sub u ignignokt 7 made the comment will trade 1 ltc for cake i half jokingly offered to have my wife bake one for him in exchange for the coin and shipping costs it would be a great real world transaction not just a trade for investment well after sitting on the idea for a while and then deciding it wasn t worth the trouble of shipping a delicate baked good ignignokt 7 said he would pay my wife the coin if she baked the cake shared it with someone else and told them it was from a crypto enthusiast as a pay it forward way to spread cheer in the new year his stipulation of course was that i had to help her establish her own wallet and send him pics as proof i was happy to do so since this was a way to get her more interested in crypto usually her eyes glaze over in boredom when i start talking about blockchain haha my wife decided to share the cake with the other staff in the medical office where she works i think she may be the only new crypto wallet holder out of this endeavor but she said a few people told her they loved the cake and the reason why she made it for them per her request here what i wrote for her to include with the cake gt in a discussion on reddit i saw a cryptocurrency enthusiast say he d like to buy a lemon cake with his digital money i half jokingly told him my wife makes a great lemon cake and offered to sell him one long story short he didn t want to go to the trouble of having it shipped but offered to pay her one litecoin usd value approximately 30 to bake the cake and share it with others to spread cheer in the new year so please enjoy i thought this was a pretty fun thing to do and appreciate ignignokt 7 s generosity in helping get my wife to share my interest in crypto i hope you all enjoyed it too pics or it didn t happen proof of transaction lnt6nezkkbtk9bacb79ruod6thxdsuue3k 	1

so you are ready to buy your first crypto wondering how to store your coins with so many crypto wallets out there it can be very tricky to decide where exactly to keep your digital currency right but here we are an incredibly friendly stealthex team to guide and help you realize which type of wallet is just right for you let s start with some basics what is a cryptocurrency wallet in simple terms it is a kind of a digital equivalent of a bank account that allows you to store send and receive digital coins the main feature is that crypto wallets have two important components a public key and a private key the public key is a wallet address to which anyone can send you coins the private key is both a login and a password used to access your currency the other feature of crypto wallets is the fact that they don t actually store currency in any physical form and when someone sends you crypto they are essentially signing off ownership of their coins to the address of your wallet the transaction is confirmed by a record on the blockchain and a change in a balance in your crypto wallet there are different classifications of wallets let s go through the main types and features of digital wallets 1 classification by type of access to the wallet hot wallets these ones have access to the internet and a blockchain in particular they are considered hot because of the greater ability for activity and accessibility just like cash in your pocket pros can help you make transactions in the blink of an eye user friendly cons security risks cold wallets these are stored offline most of the time cold wallets are some kind of a safe where you can store a great number of digital coins for a long time pros high level of security cons not easy to access low speed 2 classification by wallet s weight heavy wallets require downloading the entire blockchain which will later be stored on a computer occupying a significant place on your hard disk pros no risks of transferring personal information over the network cons risk of getting a virus on your computer usage inconvenience light wallets these ones access the blockchain via third party services and therefore do not require downloading and storing the entire blockchain on a computer pros independence you can choose which service to use very easy to handle cons risk of hackers attack 3 classification by the ways of private key storage desktop wallets these are downloaded and installed on your computer which gives you some security as you are unable to access this wallet from anywhere else aside from the actual desktop pros good security level convenience a great choice of wallets free downloads cons risk of computer viruses and hacker attacks examples exodus bitcoin core mobile wallets run as an app on your phone storing your private keys and allowing you to make transactions directly from your phone pros simple very handy free downloads cons risk of hacking losing or damaging your phone which will lead to problems with access to your crypto examples xapo coinomi online wallets these run on a cloud service owned by a third party in this case the private keys are located on remote servers this type of wallet allows users not only to open several addresses for different cryptocurrencies but also to trade on exchanges estimate commissions using the built in calculator and so on pros easy to use able to work with multiple cryptocurrencies high transaction speed cons security risks additional expenses such a commission to the service examples holytransaction coinbase hardware wallets the transactions are made online but the private key is stored offline on a usb stick or a specially designed piece of hardware these wallets can be considered as cold wallets until they are offline pros very high level of security easy to set up and use cons expensive 150 200 inconvenient if you need fast access to your coins examples keepkey trezor paper wallets a unique storage option representing a printed qr code containing a public address and a private key it is a super cold wallet great option for long term storage for those who do not trust gadgetry pros highest level of security cons risk of destruction or loss of paper that contains wallet info totally not for beginners example bitaddress org as you can see there is no such thing as the best crypto wallet the right wallet for you will be the one that matches your needs and the purpose of your cryptocurrency savings if you have any questions or comments please hit us up in the comments below follow us on medium twitter facebook and reddit to get stealthex io updates and the latest news about the crypto world for all requests message us at support stealthex io 	2

a few years back it took me a while but i got used to microsoft s new logo look the simplified window pane design of four silver or colored straight edge blocks it s almost hard to remember now the old wavy window image almost more of a flag of colors waving in the wind looking back now it was soooo big hair 1980s i think i see the litecoin foundation moving the litecoin logo towards the simplicity image and i do think this is good and the right way to go getting away from the british pound look or having the world s continents in the background is indeed kind of like the move microsoft did with it s logo but there is such a thing as hitting the sweet spot with a logo design and i don t think you should ever quit until you get it just right the most recent lf endorsed litecoin logos are 97 to 98 on target in my opinion with the exception of the new much skinnier l in the middle of the circle if you get it too thinned down it get s harder to see on a ufc matt and thinned down isn t a great subliminal message as far as branding goes the other feature to be aware of is color i think ufc guys like silver i think they like black and they probably like blue too as long as it isn t a dull or pastel ish blue i guess what i am saying with the new logo is that it is dead on what it should be but it just needs to be ever sol slightly sharpened up boldened up and vivided up whatever color just commit to that color so it jumps off the matt or a t shirt just a bit more i say this because i think going forward with ufc exposure crowd you have to think about how they will look at the logo too not just corporate look 	1
