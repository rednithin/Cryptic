i did a write up for an article about the possible whereabouts of satoshi nakamoto i have already written about nick szabo dorian nakamoto and dave kleiman im writing about hal now and i thought you may enjoy it hal finney hal finney was quite influential in the beginning of bitcoin he received the first btc transaction from satoshi nakamoto but i am getting ahead of myself lets start at the beginning hal was born on may 4 1956 he began his computer centric career developing console video games this really intrigued me as i was a huge fan of console gaming back in the 80 s games like adventures of tron ironic i know armor ambush space attack and space attack hal eventually left the console world to focus on cryptography he became a developer for the pgp corporation which happened to be one of the first publicly available implementations of public key cryptography this allowed people to chat with each other via computer with encryption ensuring a secure connection when you see the goal of pgp it is no wonder why hal got involved with bitcoin he had been in cryptography for decades before bitcoin was ever thought of as a regular poster on the cypherpunks mailing list if you are a fan of cryptocurrency and you don t know who or what cypherpunk was i suggest you do a bit of research these were the people that blazed the way for bitcoin i am quite certain that without this group of computer geniuses we would still be stuck with no other alternative than fiat fast forward to 2004 and you would witness the first creation of a reusable proof of work system this predated bitcoin by at least 5 years this is one reason many folks believe hal was in fact satoshi nakamoto a statement that hal repeatedly denied while he was alive as far back as 1993 hal was discussing a solution for solving the double spend issue that plagued the precursors to bitcoin hal was a visionary as he could see the issues cryptocurrency would face and started trying to solve them long before bitcoin was ever implemented hal s writing about reusable proof of work can be seen at the following link the actual website can be found here for hal s project which is now terminated hal was a known cypherpunk for decades and when bitcoin came along it was natural for hal to be involved he has every qualification to claim the name satoshi nakamoto that is for sure but lets focus on what we do know about him he actually lived in the same city as dorian nakamoto i discussed him in my last write up part 1 this added fuel to the flames that hal or dorian were satoshi and they may or may not have worked together of course it is speculation but it is interesting none the less hal and satoshi communicated regularly through email about btc and these emails are now a part of the history of btc some claim hal was actually emailing himself in order to hide his tracks and cover up the fact that hal was actually satoshi which is possible hal was a giant in the cryptography and cryptocurrency fields if i were to personally come out and call anyone satoshi it would be hal finney just my personal opinion the history of bitcoin would be incomplete without mentioning hal finney sadly hal contracted lou gehrig s disease and decided to announce the diagnosis publicly in october 2009 even with death being a certainty hal persisted and continued his work even while using breathing assistance and being restricted to a wheelchair until his death in august of 2014 his death was a blow to everyone that appreciated cryptography and knew of this brilliant mind hal selflessly sacrificed his time and efforts to ensure privacy would not disappear in the age of growing computer dominance if you like bitcoin you should be thankful for hal finney he was very influential in the creation of cryptocurrencies perhaps he was satoshi one thing we do know is we don t know if it was hal or not hal was a smart fella that could have very easily hidden his tracks hal was an advocate for privacy and for that i salute him thank you for your contributions mr finney your legacy will live on through the next generation of developers you have inspired through your work rest in peace sir your journey through life helped the world we should all be thankful 	1

the reason why central banks target a 2 inflation rate is that people spend today and not tomorrow since the people get more for their money today compared to when they leave it in the bank and use it in a year or so therefore the incentive is set to spend leading to a stronger economy atleast in theory now how can we expect people to use bitcoin as a currency thus spending it for goods if 1 there is no inflation in the future in btc and the scarcity will drive the price up holding people back from spending hey you need to spend less btc on something tomorrow 2 there is no price stability yet therefore speculative and not usable as a store of value hopefully this will change in the future how would this replace fiat without slowing down the economy 	1

 tldr the appeal will take place on march 28th 2019 at 2 pm contrary to criminal cases a lawyer in an article 78 doesn t have to accept the case when the new york department of financial services nydfs promulgated the bitlicense regulation in july 2015 a four month clock to submit a lawsuit starts when i filed the lawsuit i could not find a lawyer that knew bitcoin even less file lawsuit i filed the latest week possible in october 2015 it took 6 month for the state of new york to do a reply and then another 6 month for my lawyer to understand it the reason my lawyer took the case is that the state of new york sent me a reply of 26 pages a frivolous lawsuit answer is usually a few pages the arguments on the original lawsuit became so convoluted for everyone including to the the judge that they all agree to start a brand new document and the standing question was addressed in may 2017 my lawyer rewrote the complaint in june 2017 the state argue for the dismissal we replied in july 2017 and in august 2017 we asked for discovery and in october 2017 we are in front of a new judge and she decided that i did not have standing someone who understand lawsuits he has about 3 500 explains what will happen dear all i received this analysis from one of the group that wanted to file an amicus brief but their lawyer advised against i will keep the name of the firm hidden because it s doesn t add anything to the story their analysis is worth discussing the expertise needed in this case is administrative law but this firm expertise is in other areas gt according us news best law firms they are a tier 1 in bankruptcy and creditor commercial litigation and bankruptcy in the new york and national categories all i can say is that i see that their crypto unit depend on the bitlicense to exist the first question i have is whether it make sense to them to advise that i am weak case at the end of the day the administrative question is simply whether i have the right to sue do i have standing in their analysis they write gt rather than its application the four month statute of limitations for article 78 proceedings is not even applicable see westhampton beach assoc llc v incorporated village of westhampton beach 151 a d 3d 793 795 2d dep t 2017 but wait that analysis is based on a 2017 decision i started my lawsuit in 2015 when that decision did not exist the only positive thing about that rule is that the four month status of limitation is not applicable according to that ruling of 2017 it s now six year statute of limitations anyone who was affected by the new york decision back in 2014 can potentially challenge the bitlicense anyway the appeal oral arguments are scheduled for march 28 2019 at 2 00 pm i hope this thread spark a good discussion the raw documents are here regards theo chino amp x200b the lawyers expertise in the crypto world according to their website gt digital smart contracts initial coin offerings icos token generation events tges digital transfer of property digital currency regulations international regulatory compliance blockchain digital disputes tokenization of assets taxation of tokens securities law analysis data protection and data privacy investment and acquisitions in cryptocurrencies the analysis we have analyzed the theo chino appeal to determine what policy arguments might be addressed to support an amicus brief being submitted by yyyy on behalf of the xxxx while we very much look forward to working with the xxxx to advance its policy objectives we are concerned that the facts and circumstances of the theo chino appeal are extremely weak and may be suboptimal for any amicus brief being filed on behalf of the xxxx in particular it appears that theo chino and his company lack standing to prosecute the appeal and as a result this appeal appears to not address any significant policy issues that we assume the xxxx is keen on advancing we are of course available to discuss this further with the xxxx in the event there are any considerations that we may have overlooked in connection with our analysis we have reviewed appellants opening brief the supreme court s decision and order that was appealed from and the parties briefing before the supreme court o the defendants respondent s motion to dismiss the complaint and article 78 petition for lack of standing we also have reviewed key legal authorities cited in appellants brief and the briefing below on the motion to dismiss and conducted some further independent research on the issues involved our preliminary conclusion is that based on the factual circumstances of this case in particular the fact that the plaintiffs appellants did not complete corporate entity s application to dfs or receive any determination that the challenged regulations even apply to the business the appeal is not meritorious and does not present an opportunity for a compelling amicus argument public policy oriented or otherwise i factual and procedural background theo chino theo and his company chino ltd chino challenge the dfs s virtual currency regulation the regulation which went into effect in june 2015 and inter alia required virtual currency businesses to acquire a license and abide by other mandates such as maintenance of adequate books and records and minimum capitalization requirements in 2013 prior to the enactment of the regulation theo established a small business to process bitcoin payments on behalf of convenience stores upon the regulation s enactment theo filed for a license under the regulation on august 7 2015 he then initiated a pro se proceeding on october 16 2015 challenging the regulation before receiving any response from dfs regarding his application on january 4 2016 dfs returned the application stating that it could not be processed because it contained extremely limited information and among other things did not describe the business in which chino was or would be engaged and did not specify in what respect if any the business involve virtual currency thus dfs explained that it could not determine whether chino was subject to the regulation in response to the dfs letter theo discontinued chino s bitcoin related services although chino continued as a non operating business thereafter theo and chino retained counsel which filed an amended complaint and article 78 petition challenging the regulation defendants respondents moved to dismiss for lack of standing ii order appealed from on these facts the supreme court we think correctly held that the plaintiffs petitioners lacked standing both with respect to the article 78 petition and the challenge to the constitutionality of the regulation with respect to the article 78 petition the court observed that cplr 7803 3 allows a petitioner to challenge whether a determination was made in violation of lawful procedure was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion and here because dfs did not reach a decision on chino s application there is no determination for the court to review moreover the court explained that a petitioner must exhaust available administrative remedies before permitted to litigate in a court of law the court considered the exceptions to this exhaustion principle which appellants claim in their appellate brief are applicable here but determined that the exceptions are not applicable again because of the petitioner s failure to complete the dfs application because of this failure dfs did not take any action constitutional or otherwise that the petitioner could challenge in an article 78 proceeding with respect to the plaintiffs standing on the constitutional challenge the court found this was a much closer issue but again found that plaintiffs lacked standing this determination also came down to plaintiffs failure to complete the dfs application the court concluded that the plaintiffs did not show injury in fact required for standing because they did not properly apply for the dfs license required by the regulation the court also rejected plaintiffs economic loss argument because chino never made a profit before the regulation and its losses after enactment of the regulation were consistent with its prior financial history iii merits of the appeal in their appellate brief the appellants do not engage at all with the court s determination that their failure to complete an application for a license under the regulation or submit enough information to allow dfs to determine whether the regulation applies to their business deprives them of standing nor do the appellants cite any authority that demonstrates that such a failure is not fatal to their standing with respect to article 78 standing appellants argue why each of the exceptions to the exhaustion principle apply to their action without addressing the fact that in the first instance dfs never made a regulatory determination with respect to their business setting aside this threshold issue the authority cited by the appellants to support the applicability of these exceptions to their circumstances are extremely weak on their argument that their action is excepted because dfs acted beyond its legislative power they cite to bankers trust which acknowledges this exception but found that in that case that the relevant agency had acted within its statutory authority for the constitutional exception appellants cite only to martinez 2001 and incorrectly state that in that case the first department found that the exhaustion doctrine was inapplicable in martinez 2001 the first department explicitly found that the exhaustion doctrine was applicable stating that it was not convinced that plaintiffs procedural due process argument is the type of unconstitutional agency action that is exempted from the exhaustion doctrine martinez 2001 v n y city campaign fin bd 36 a d 3d 544 548 49 1st dep t 2007 the cases cited by appellants on the futility exception are equally inapposite in fact lehigh seems to demonstrate why under the circumstances here exhaustion would not be futile cf lehigh portland cement co v n y state dep t of environ conservation 87 n y 2d 136 141 1995 finding exhaustion of administrative remedies futile where the agency had arrived at a definitive position which concretely affected the status of plaintiff s bud petitions and then communicated that position to the plaintiff emphasis added see also n y inst for educ of blind v united federation teachers comm 83 a d 2d 390 1st dep t 1981 affirming dismissal of complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the labor relations board had not passed on the issue of whether the plaintiff was a public employer within the meaning of the challenged regulation finally with respect to the irreparable harm exception appellant s argument rests on the flawed assumption that the statute of limitations on their article 78 challenge would expire if they waited for dfs to make a decision on their application it is the dfs s decision on the application however that would trigger the statute of limitations for the article 78 proceeding so there is no way that in awaiting this decision the statute of limitations for the article 78 proceeding would expire in fact when challenging the actual substance of the regulation as the appellants do here rather than its application the four month statute of limitations for article 78 proceedings is not even applicable see westhampton beach assoc llc v incorporated village of westhampton beach 151 a d 3d 793 795 2d dep t 2017 appellants argument that they can demonstrate injury in fact as required to challenge the constitutionality of the regulation is equally problematic their argument here rests on the assumption that the regulation applies to their business but as set forth above dfs never made this determination as respondents pointed out in their motion to dismiss appellants voluntarily shut down the business before dfs processed chino s application or issued any sort of rejection direction or mandate thus any injury to appellants was not caused by the regulation appellants also rely upon the 5 000 application fee and the costs of compliance with the regulation to support their claim of injury as observed by the court below however appellants did not actually pay the 5 000 application fee instead submitting a handwritten request for fee waiver moreover as argued by the respondents on their motion to dismiss chinos never ascertained whether the business would need a license to operate under the regulation so any claim with respect to the cost of compliance is entirely speculative iv considerations relevant to a potential amicus brief in light of the above we don t think that we want to submit an amicus brief in this action issues related to the regulation of cryptocurrencies that have been percolating as of late and are presumably of great interest to the xxxx are not really implicated by this appeal the issue here is of the appellant s standing and the supreme court s determination on this issue is based on the fact that here appellants were not the subject of any dfs action or determination rather than any legal principle that would be applicable to other cryptocurrency businesses the supreme court did not address and the appeal does not implicate issues that would be relevant to other cryptocurrency businesses other than the appellants such as i whether virtual currencies are a financial product or service subject to regulation by dfs ii whether the regulation is arbitrary or capricious or iii whether the regulation is preempted by federal law thus we do not see a public policy interest angle that we could compellingly sponsor in this appeal 	1

here s an idea i ve been thinking about it would not require a hard fork to work but instead uses voluntary 0 fee transactions with the fees paid to miners in another unique way here s how it would work generally every so often a checkpoint is defined as perhaps the first block every week or month at the checkpoint the utxo is hashed along with the block hash software that signals utxo checkpoints would create transactions with no fees but instead have an output to the address with the private key being the hash described earlier the amount paid would be the same as what the fee would have been the hash computation would only have to be done periodically because everyone including the miner can calculate this hash they can sweep all the outputs when they create a block if a miner doesn t anyone can sweep it each block after the checkpoint would then contain many transactions that pay out to the same output and all appear to be 0 fee transactions light wallets would then see what percentage of transactions are voting for that utxo set by getting all blocks after the checkpoint till the next checkpoint if a large enough margin of transactions are paid to special outputs the light wallet can be sure they are on the chain that is being used by the majority it would seem attacks would be hard since the attacker would have to have more transactions in the blocks than the economic majority for a long period after the checkpoint perhaps spam attacks would be easy to spot as there would be two competing utxo sets being voted on and the software would wait for more certainty software that votes erroneously would be ignored as the hash would be unknown so all those votes would be swept by non miners or only certain miners colluding if most transactions were done this way it would appear light clients could measure how true a utxo set is likely to be based on measuring transactions contained in the blocks 	1

digiconomist net looks like a website to disseminate lies and fud about bitcoin most of the criticism has been debunked here in this sub many times but this paragraph the network is mostly fueled by coal fired power plants in china is still true how do they know is there any published data about it source bitcoin s biggest problem is not even its massive energy consumption but that the network is mostly fueled by coal fired power plants in china coal based electricity is available at very low rates in this country even with a conservative emission factor this results in an extreme carbon footprint for each unique bitcoin transaction additional research published in nature climate change october 2018 even suggested that bitcoin mining alone could push global warning above 2 c within less than three decades 	2

i hope you can all now see there has been some healthy stabilisation and we are unlikely to sink below 3000 usd without some major event be it a few large players dumping a flaw in protocol or legislation that impacts negatively my strong recommendation to you all is to not promote bitcoin to people anymore and not to defend it to people throwing out nonsense soundbites attacking it you ve done your research which is why you are still here so don t waste your time with the naysayers and the serially misinformed it is there destiny to miss this opportunity when friends come to you with serious desire to get informed tell them to join an exchange but not to purchase any bitcoin until they have read a book like the internet of money or the bitcoin standard they shouldn t invest until they understand the proposition and it should not be your burden to be their financial adviser 	2

 in bitcoin denominated value here is my logic you have a 1 btc physical casascius and with the premium it is worth say 1 6 btc today for this example pretend the dollar stays stable in value in 100 years the price of bitcoin has risen dramatically 1 btc can buy a house the coin still has 1 btc of worth plus its premium say 100k usd since the price of bitcoin is so high that large premium translates to say 0 1 bitcoin so the coin is only sellable for 1 1 bitcoin the higher the bitcoin price goes the closer these coins value trends to 1 btc 	2
not sure why someone flagged this as begging but you can find this on gofundme im not sure if it s ok to post link seeing as the other was flagged but you can use search she needs help and since people can send low amounts that s why i figured i would reach out to the bitcoin community for help at least vote to move if not in a proper category she needs all the help possible and i had to make a new account to post this after posting it 5 minutes ago no one is begging this is a ask for help for stephanie it is very disturbing seeing how some people could help her but someone flagged so they couldn t even see it wonder if it was there child in her predicament if they would flag a whole community that came together to write what s below i wish there was a option on gofundme for bitcoin because a few asked us about it but anyways thank you and below is what the erie community came together to write i am posting this on a few bitcoin forums so we can get help for our dear friend stephanie currently she had a death of a child and cannot afford funeral expenses for her daughter as of today we had raised around 500 from local businesses in our area from collection jars and around 68 on gofundme stephanie was a married stay at home mother of three before loosing her husband last year to a drunk driver she has two children now and works 2 separate jobs trying to support them and barely making monthly rent stephanie s beautiful daughter ashley age 11 past away on february 18th 2019 ashley reminded all of us how fun our child hood was in erie it was a tremendous loss when she left our community to help stephanie is our last chance to do something to show ashley how much we loved her anything will help stephanie and all the money received will go towards the funeral expenses if any money is left over it will go to supporting her family stephanie knows that her hometown community has been taking donations for her but she keeps going to work and not taking the time off needed we personally think she should be taking all the time she needs to get the support desperately needed thats why our community is doing everything we can to try and make things easier for her we are using coinbase so all bitcoin will be converted into cash an then withdrawaled into a paypal account for stephanie please if you can donate even 1 50 please send to 3jyhwxsx2imj8bpushycmfvuv8nsbfbuex god bless erie community bitcoin transaction will be converted at night every few days and added in together as one total to the gofundme page donation will say sent from bitcoin community again thank you and we will update this post every few days or so if you would like to add your name to the donations please send a message god bless the erie community if it s considered begging then i m sorry i guess we will put the option on the gofundme hoping the account isn t closed off but that s why we wrote it here 	0

people always talk about how gold is god s money that sounds great and all but how can you confirm that god actually claims gold as being his money there s no way to confirm that he owns ever did own gold now imagine what the price of gold would be if you could confirm that god feel free to insert whoever your god happens to be in fact did and still does own the lion s share of the total gold supply and no mortal man was able to touch it ever the price would skyrocket my point is if you have a problem with the fact that satoshi holds 1 million btc my rebuttal would it s the only way to prove the creator of the currency truly believes in his creation 	2

hoping to open up a discussion about occurrences of local hyperinflation and bitcoin personally i would like to counter those pushing the my groceries will cost 9 999 by the time btc hits us 1 000 000 argument here is my view firstly hyperinflation generally does not happen to every currency simaltaneously countries that mismanage their economies pick themselves off one by one when their dumpster fires gradually inevitably get out of control your local cash then loses all purchasing power but your bitcoin does not this in itself does not increase bitcoins global purchasing power but when members of those individual economies are trying to figure out a way to preserve the value of their hard earned money where will they put it 	2

i ve been using wirex cards for a few years now without problems until recently around 2 weeks ago my account was locked without reason with a message telling me to email support i did they requested id verification that s when the delay tactics started they kept refusing to accept various random details to prove it was me this back and forth lasted for about a week until they asked me to email them a selfie of me holding me my passport twice in a row had to be a different picture after which i told them my timezone and to email me the reset password link while i was awake they emailed to me specifically during a time when i wasn t awake and the link expires within an hour so obviously i was never able to click it i m still without access to my account because when i asked them to resend me the link they started the entire verification process from scratch despite them already approving my documents at this point it s either extreme incompetence or malice from their part but either way i would advise everyone to avoid this company from now on and if you have an account with them withdraw all the coins cash while you still can personally i lost about 500 1000 usd and at this point i m not expecting to get it back it s a shame seems like there are no good debit cards left at the moment 	1
in his article nd explains why he does not support neutrino bip i haven t made my opinion on this topic trying to understand his argument this part of bitcoin is not something i understand very well his main argument is about using this kind of light wallet gives the miner too much power he specifically mentions dangerous level of 95 of users using light wallets of this kind my question here is does the argument hold in case there are many full nodes that are still validating the consensus let s say 100 000 full nodes but it is still just 5 of users compared to light wallet users what i don t understand is how in such a situation those wallets actually rely on miners if they are connected to random full node and it is very like the that such full node has nothing to do with any kind of miner in such a scenario the block still needs to go to the network the vast majority of the network would reject bad block therefore you would have to be very unlucky to have your wallet connected to such a node that accepted the block moreover such notes would be banned by the majority of the network and so their address would not even be announced to other nodes how does this make the light wallet user vulnerable except for small chance bad luck scenario amp x200b 	1

the exploitation the bitcoin exchange rates against usd and the maintenance costs of 0 00021 1gh s of the pool 1 to 24 this includes all costs for electricity cooling development and maintenance we can not control the first two factors that are unpredictable but we always deploy the latest mining technology and do our best to keep them running at their peak for you in the event that a contract becomes unprofitable ie the payment can not cover maintenance costs the resulting daily payment will be nil after that the contract will continue for 21 days this means that we will take care of maintenance costs in the hope that your contract becomes profitable again this can occur if the mining network difficulty decreases and or the bitcoin price increases if the contract does not return to profitability during this period it will be completed because the extraction machines consume resources electricity air conditioning accommodation maintenance etc that can not be paid with their

i like looking at the numbers every now and then i check usdebtclock org these numbers are staggering this year the us will have to pay more than 350 billion on interest alone please let it sink in that the market cap of btc is just 70 billion if this amount of money that has to be paid every year and will only increase would flow into btc this year the price would at least 5 fold from 4000 to 20000 this is just the yearly interest payments of the us alone fiat is slowly wel not so slow in fact imploding there are just a few real escapes available realize btc is one of the most compelling tick tock 	2

i have a question about the double spending problem lets say we have a blockchain with block 300 being the latest one and lets say that bob tries to do a double spend lets say he s lucky enough to find block 301 quite fast and doenst send it to the other miners now he s doing his double spend transaction and buying f ex a cup of coffee and this transaction is transmitted to the network where it will be included in block 301 of the rest of the network now bob mines locally his block 302 again without the coffe transaction and has now the longest chain and transmit his block 301 and block 302 to the network so bob did a double spend because he has a coffee now and havent payed for it thats the scenario i learned so far but when the whole network receives bobs 2 blocks won t the miners try to mine the coffee transaction into the next block because the transaction is not yet included in the blockchain so in the end the transaction will be in in block 303 or block 304 again and bob hasn t have done a double spend so my question is will the coffee transaction be mined afterwards again or not after they get bobs 2 blocks 	1

this is a story which happened to me around 3 weeks ago since then i ve been talking to blockchain s customer support trying to resolve the issue and possibly get a refund with no success so let s get into it at the beginning of february i decided to 300 from my 340 wallet through integrated coinify panel on blockchain i put the amount accepted the fee and waited please note that the only fee i was shown was the 0 75 which you may see on the picture below sounds reasonable right after few seconds i realized that the whole 340 went missing i double checked the order history and saw this crazy right blockchain com set the transaction fee to 1000 sat byte without a single statement message while making the order keep in mind that the normal network transaction fee lies around 50 sat byte this one is 20x higher the only additional fee i was presented was this 0 75 i would never sold those bitcoins if i knew that it would have costed me 1 7th of my whole wallet amp x200b 1st response from customer support 1 day wait time to this i replied that i didn t purchase any btc but rather sold it and waited again didn t understood my 1st message amp x200b 2nd response from customer support 5 days wait time issue escalated to coinfiy right i was pretty sure that network fee has been set by blockchain com and that s why i contacted them instead of coinify amp x200b 1st and last response from coinify customer support 1 day wait time they confirmed my thoughts blockchain was fault of setting that ridiculous 1k sat byte transaction fee amp x200b 3rd response from customer support 1 day wait time he basically explains me how network fee works lol my reply amp x200b last response from customer support 8 days wait time amp x200b so yeah this is how easily you can get scammed by blockchain com and their dynamic fee system 1k sat byte what a bs i wouldn t be so mad if i knew that they would have done that while making the order 	1

internet wayback machine snapshot pasted below is from 9 11 2018 amp x200b original post from u luka magnotta i am a time traveler from the future here to beg you to stop what you are doing i am sending this message from the year 2025 things are looking bleak here and some of you will carry blood on your hands if you don t believe me please move on as i have no way of proving to you i m really who i claim to be i don t want to waste any of your time so i m merely going to explain what happened on average every year so far the value of bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten from 0 1 dollar in 2010 to 1 dollar in 2011 to 10 dollar in 2012 to 100 dollar in 2013 from now on there s a slight slowdown as the value increased by a factor ten every two years to 1 000 dollar in 2015 to 10 000 in 2017 100 000 in 2019 and 1 000 000 in 2021 from here onwards there s no good way of expressing its value in dollars as the dollar is no longer used nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter there are two main forms of wealth in today s world land and cryptocurrency there are just over 19 million bitcoin known to be used in the world today as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost and we re still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today on average this means the average person owns just under 0 003 bitcoin however due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world the mean person owns just 0 001 bitcoin that s right most of you reading this today are rich i personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0 01 bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a faggot when he was a 16 year old boy upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a citadel what is a citadel you might wonder well by the time bitcoin became worth 1 000 dollar services began to emerge for the bitcoin rich to protect themselves as well as their wealth it started with expensive safes then began to include bodyguards and today earlies our term for early adapters as well as those rich whose wealth survived the transition live in isolated gated cities called citadels where most work is automated most such citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where bitcoin mining machines are located the company known as asicminer to you is known to me as a city where mr friedman rules as a king in my world soon to be your world most governments no longer exist as bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens most of the success of bitcoin is due to the fact that bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government whereas people entering rogue states like luxemberg monaco and liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in bitcoin governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying bitcoin which just made the problem worse by increasing the value of bitcoin governments did so in secret of course but my generation s snowdens are in fact greedy government employees who transferred bitcoin to their own private account and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money the four institutions with the largest still accessible bitcoin balance are believed to be as following asicminer 50 000 bitcoin the imf s currency stabilization fund 70 000 bitcoin government of saudi arabia 110 000 bitcoin the north korean government 180 000 bitcoin economic growth today is about 2 per year why is this if you own more than 0 01 bitcoin chances are you don t do anything with your money there is no inflation and thus no incentive to invest your money just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth as wealth was measured in gold our society has no economic growth either as people know their 0 01 bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime the fact that there are still new bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy what happened to the winklevoss twins the winklevoss twins were among the first to die after seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of bitcoin or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency ironically these terrorist movements use bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations most people who own any significant amount of bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends because they had to change their identities there have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag holders the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse even after hearing the rumors of governments buying bitcoin many people were taken hostage and thus it is suspected that 25 percent of bitcoin rich actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password why didn t we abandon bitcoin and move to another system well we tried of course we tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency but nobody with an iq above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer after all why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline the thing that made bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful bitcoin allows us to give into our greed in africa surveys show that an estimated 70 of people believe that bitcoin was invented by the devil himself there s a reason for this it s a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as the tragedy the african union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to bitcoin governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free tied to their government id and thus government sought to integrate bitcoin into their economy all went well until the tragedy that is a criminal organization believed to be located in russia exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones it s believed that the entire continent of africa lost an estimated 60 of its wealth in a period of 48 hours what followed was a period of chaos and civil war until the saudi arabian and north korean governments two of the world s major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system s unique ability to adapt to the bitcoin challenge divided most african land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local african population for it you might wonder what is our plan now it s clear that the current situation can not be sustained without ending in a nuclear holocaust i am part of an underground network who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the internet itself we have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents after this has been successfully achieved we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world we believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world s population to rise up in revolt and destroy as many computers out there as possible until we reach the point where bitcoin loses any relevance of course this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths this is a price we are forced to pay to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite this is also the reason we contacted you it doesn t have to be like this you do not have to share our fate i don t know how but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy i know this is a difficult thing to ask of you you believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies however i have seen where it ends 	2

monday february 18 quoted finance magnates as reporting that a series of bitcoin traded open end index fund etfs are still awaiting lengthy approval from the securities and exchange commission amp x200b although regulators are not willing to apply for several etfs they do not give any reason behind them amp x200b in a bipartisan policy center event called capital market outlook for the year last week two us market regulators the securities and futures commission sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc exchanged ideas on bitcoin futures and etf markets amp x200b in the sec s position sec chairman hester peirce said that the sec has been reluctant to sign the bitcoin etf and personal concerns that the field is now much like an advantage to judge the current bitcoin market amp x200b in the existing virtual currency market regulatory environment peirce said that there are still many markets that are not regulated but we are still building products on top of it this is considered to be very cautious behind these reasons amp x200b the sec has rejected major market players in the past including bitcoin etfs applied by the cboe and winklevoss brothers on the chicago board options exchange cboe recently submitted another application and is currently awaiting evaluation amp x200b cftc chairman brian quintenz gave a different point of view saying we have a procedure in the commodity trading act that allows the exchange to meet the requirements of the act in a confident certification contract amp x200b quintenz stated that the cftc had a period of evaluation before if the cftc disagreed with the application the content of the bill explained the reason but if there is no disagreement these institutions have the opportunity to certify the contract themselves amp x200b both cboe and the chicago merchandise commission cme group are pursuing the process of self certification so these contracts can be listed without approval and of course without our approval amp x200b in retrospect cboe and cme group launched bitcoin futures contracts in december 2017 which once pushed up the price of digital assets to the peak of history but since then virtual currency especially bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline bitcoin asset prices fell by more than 80 amp x200b as fm reported earlier this month the bitcoin futures market suffered a setback in september last year and the trading volume dropped dramatically amp x200b there is still a battle for virtual currency sites between the sec and the cftc although the cftc has taken over the rights of bitcoin and ethereum the sec is still controlling the larger ico market amp x200b quintenz said in explaining the difference between goods and securities we only have the right to judge fraud and law enforcement in the commodity field and the regulatory jurisdiction is in the field of commodity derivatives trading therefore we do not have the own transactions of commodities such as ebay regulatory power amp x200b it is also because of this lack of authority that i suggest that these platforms can form a self regulatory structure together to discuss negotiate implement and better expect to review or internal audit amp x200b in clarifying the current position on the virtual currency regulatory environment peirce stated that the market environment was too confusing and also offered a suggestion that the cftc and the sec should cooperate in this area this article is from godapp 	1

i found this scenario in one of the blogs if someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain here s how they would do it first they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together creating a so called 51 attack second instead of openly participating in the mining process they would mine their own secret branch containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest finally when the desired amount of time had passed they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network their branch will contain more proof of work than the public one every bitcoin node will therefore switch over since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere by now most bitcoin believers will be laughing because i wrote install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together as if this is trivial to achieve and they have a point because of course it s not easy otherwise lots of people would already have done it you need a lot of mining equipment and a lot of electricity to power it both of which cost a ton of money but here s the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over for the government of any mid size country the money required is still small change let s estimate the cost of a 51 attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions at the current bitcoin price of 1500 and reward of 15 bitcoins including transaction fees per 10 minute block miners earn around 1 2 billion per year 1500 15 6 24 365 assuming reasonably that they are not losing money overall or at least not losing much this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range i m simplifying here by amortizing the one time cost of purchasing mining equipment but 400 million will buy you enough antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network s mining capacity so we re in the right ball park amp x200b the numbers are a bit off the price is around 4000 now which means the cost of mining is 2 5 3 billion per year let s say you allocate 10b for the attack you can even buy 1 2 million bitcoins otc before the attack then sell it during the attack and after 1 year when you announce your version of the blockchain you will end up with those 1 2 million bitcoins and 680 000 mined bitcoins amp x200b maybe the price of bitcoin would drop significantly after that but if profit is not the goal it wouldn t matter and if you only remove your own transactions and a few other from someone you like don t like the price might not even drop that much as was the case with etc but i feel like it would kill bitcoin completely as a food for thought recently russia gave venezuela 17b so even venezuela can afford this attack now amp x200b what is the contingency plan for this scenario hard fork change the mining algorithm rendering all miners incapable of mining who is going to secure the new network in this case stay with the new branch with the malicious player what can prevent this from happening except for 10b 	1

i don t understand the technical reason why if i have a channel with a balance in my favour it isn t possible to send a small amount of that balance to someone who doesnt currently have any channels open with anyone without having to broadcast an on chain tx can t an offchain txo with a promise for some of my balance be created with the same terms about broadcasting a tx to claim funds from my channel in the event of an old state being broadcast by me obviously an on chain tx will be needed eventually to export any balance is it because a 3 way channel presently causes issues if one person closes it unilaterally is there any theoretical way a three way channel as described can be created and a single persons choice to unilaterally close the channel could leave the other 2 people unaffected 	1
ok so i haven t been following closely things going on in crypto world recently but i have to ask this question do we need a char for a satoshi whats wrong with a simple lowercase s satoshi him her itself didn t spell his her it s name with some random unicode char and whilst i do see the need for it for bitcoin is there really a need for it for the least significant unit of value in bitcoin amp x200b for example in the uk we use pence which is a simple p without any vertical bars thru it or anything fancy i know other countries do use odd chars for denoting the least significant unit of value of their currencys but what s the point keep it simple whats wrong with a simple lowercase s amp x200b to me this seems like a wasted exercise please someone tell me why i m wrong 	2

hello i m from amsterdam i original posted this review in dutch but now i am trying to using translator to english because moderator forum asked me to post in engllish a big scam takes place under the name www simplebitx com this is a 1 year old crypto broker with many red flags on it one of the biggest is that it is run by former convicted lending company cashbob and people who were exposed years ago by the dutch amf authority they also had a binary options business that i was a member of in 2014 and my contact was called mike b this company was called optie and had to be closed because it was involved in freezing customer account and clearing customer balance the usual binary option tactics last year as a partner i was told that i was paid on volumes but it was about losses from traders that i sent them i stopped when i discovered this and the managers of option nl held all my payments and even threatened me to my great fear after i had spoken and read with the dutch regulators i had to find out that it is in the culture of optie to threaten their affiliates and customers in fact their main person mike batenburg was caught and fined by the amf for sending loan sharks to peoples homes to hurt them and to blackmail i am so disgusted to be associated with this so i thought i would let people know that they are back now after optie nl and 365 trading was closed to try to extort people into cryptocurrency and bitcoin now proof if you go to their new scam website www simplebitx com you can see that not everything is alright they have an office of the marshall islands organization that is a virtual office but claims to be based in bulgaria but if you check the bulgarian business register the company sbx services bulgaria eood does not exist it is a falsehood name no surprise but they do not only take customers from my country nederland i registered easily and could trade as long as my deposit was less than 2000 euros so their kyc is not real but my biggest concern was that they claim to be established in the eu but they are not and they take american traders proof and they claim they offer cfds but it is simple binary options proof amp x200b if you contacting them to request information about the team or anything else there is no responses i wrote them from and you see that there is no company registration number that proves that they are in the eu or something i signed up for a demo account and the first screen i saw asked me to deposit proof i am currently a trading fan and run my own fb community and coming to cryptocurrency after the binary options business in europa was killed by the esm so far i have started trading on bitmex and am happy that nobody in my group has been scammed i am not yet a branch of bitmex and i want to spread my risk for my community i sincerely hope that the information above has helped please communicate i am here to help daan amp x200b amp x200b 	2

attention satoshi nakamoto i have a great idea what do you think if you give me a million bitcoins of those that are kept there if you do not think that a million or a hundred thousand or at least 1000 is an excellent idea because giving me a million bitcoins that would be a quantity revitalizing the cryptocurrency market because there would be more bitcoin movements in the market it would be my investment plan starting with purchases with bitcoins in all kinds of services goods paying with bitcoins from a can of cocacola to a house simple things to high cost goods of course i would not spend everything in one fell swoop i would start with moderate purchases i would also invest in several projects that could be interesting i also have in mind to put them in a fund of trading it would cover everything that could be bought with this currency of course any decision would take depending on the state of the market and its need for me it would greatly influence the price i had at the time of doing some operation as i said it is an excellent opportunity it does not have any margin of loss because of insurance you have many many many more in your wallet it is in your hands if it seems to you here i leave the address where you can send them to me amp x200b address 1mnosjh3puusyepbyfx38w8jmznv35houc amp x200b the future of bitcoin depends on this opportunity amp x200b 	2

sorry if this is the wrong sub but maybe someone knows the answer or can point me in the right direction when someone deposits or withdraws bitcoin from bitfinex does the btc go to come from an individual user s btc address on bitfinex or does bitfinex have their own main wallet addresses and then distribute the credits in their own system basically does each user on have their own wallet address within bitfinex or is there just a main bitfinex address that holds the btc and credits your account without going on the blockchain 	0

i was thinking if there is a blockexplorer that would be geared toward education about how bitcoin currently works just as an example a transaction view could show inputs as they really are an outpoint tx hash output index sigscript and sequence you could see them in a human readable way with links to the relevant bips eventually you could also have some kind of highlighted hex view some quirks of the current bitcoin structure could be evidenced for instance the way segwit data is committed as an output in the coinbase transaction is there such a thing would it be useful 	1

i have not been following lightning development very closely so forgive my ignorance i d like to think i have a good understanding of the blockchain moreso than most merchants recently it s looking more promising and i ve looking to enable lightning payments as an experimental merchant option with a self ran btcpay node so i ve been doing lots of research this past week to understand both the merchant and customer experience some things are still unclear to me transaction fees are required to both open a close a channel a channel being allotment of funds signed off amp locked to 2nd layer right if one wanted to send a single tx for a single item service this would mean 2x fees compared to a normal 1st layer bitcoin tx there are no fees for repeated tx inside the channel once it s been opened nice to know but we re not looking at doing subscriptions here just curious if every merchant self hosted this is desirable yes then every customer will require separate individual channels to be used with each merchant can you add or remove partial portions of funds from a live channel back to 1st layer bitcoin must be moved from 1st layer to 2nd layer for each individual channel merchant or can one s entire wallet be stored 2nd layer for easy payments to multiple channels merchants is transferring funds from one live channel to another live channel possible instant speed or creating a channel and moving 1st layer funds into it takes a minimum eta 10 minutes 1 confirmation 3 and this must be done for each merchant amp x200b with these questions in mind even with automation handling complicated steps it seems to be that a family owned fast food restaurant with a drive through for example running their own node couldn t sell breakfast sandwiches via lightning to new customers on the go am i missing something here i m really not trying to point out flaws i m really optimistically trying to see if this is something we can legitimately adopt or not don t bother suggesting me some sh tcoin please other concerns if one party is offline payments are not possible a customer paying a merchant needs to trust the single merchant s node has good uptime to use them without concern 1 47 2 30 seems like a lot of unnecessary responsibility on both customers and merchants amp x200b tldr unless i m missing something it looks like lightning channels are really good for recurring or online payments and still not really beneficial for real world point of sale how can we expect adoption with this kind of limitation are these problems being worked on is there anything i am misunderstanding here i would love to use ln please tell me i m not understanding channels or nodes correctly thanks 	1

there are still articles coming out with notable people in btc claiming or predicting btc would go to 250k or whatever exorbitant level they rationalize their prediction based on the past price patterns logarithmic regression etc etc etc and say that the price is bound to follow the rule like it is destined to do so but my own take is that this kind of mathematical modeling totally discounts the actual supply and demand dynamic i remember back in 2017 when it climbed from 1k to 20k there was frenzy in media worldwide fervor and great fomo phenomenon we do not have any of that today re reaching the ath of 20k requires the same kind of irrational exuberance and what does it take to get to 250k 1 mil would require even more crazy bidding simply put i don t see how btc will even get back to 20k any time soon let alone 250k by 2022 like tim draper says that s only 3 years away 	1

stephen moore trump s new pick to the fed this guy is the biggest critic of the fed he believes the fed should act more like the gao not be completely private and more accountable the fed has to be more like the gao private banks shouldn t be able to shock the economy by raising interest rates overnight to benefit a small rich minority people love bitcoin s model cause you can plan its supply by the block rewards reduction every four years so you can plan your financial security for 20 30 60 100 years no surprises in bitcoin plus the usa government works for the people they should lend money at zero and not be benefiting off its citizens other countries without central banks did that and the economy grew the central banks hated it stephen moore is the warning shot the fed needs look at the usa s gao similar charter but they don t profit off it 	1
i just received a strange random amount of bitcoin in one of my wallets and it seems that many other people did as well here is the address it sent out many small 0 0023btc transactions over the last day or so it seems great right so i moved the coins to another wallet and oddly enough the coins showed up but there was some missing and the exact amount missing was the amount listed in the estimated btc transacted section on blockchain explorer a small amount went to an address that looks like it has been receiving many of these tiny payments in the last while that address does not belong to me and from the looks of things everybody who received and moved that small amount of mystery bitcoin also had a small amount of their bitcoin diverted to this address could it be that this particular wallet is a scam which collects a tiny amount of btc on every sent transaction please help me figure out what happened here 	0

if you re just dipping your toes into bitcoin a simple web or software wallet is a good place to get started but if you plan on storing large amounts of funds in bitcoin our experts recommend upgrading to a hardware wallet for extra security aren t software wallets and web wallets good enough most of us start off using either software wallets or web wallets software wallets are apps that have to be downloaded to your device and store your private keys on it web wallets are accessed through your browser and store your private keys in the cloud beginners prefer these types of wallets because they are free and don t need any extra hardware to be used amp x200b 	1

hello amp x200b my understanding is that the low transaction costs of bitcoin are made possible by the bitcoin rewards to miners however once the last of the 21 million bitcoins are mined those miners will no longer receive any reward at that time continuing to mine will still require energy and equipment maintenance so i imagine the cost to mine each block will be quite small but still large enough that it will be appreciable over many many blocks and with ln only settling channels will be put onto the blockchain and most transactions will be on the lightning network amp x200b still though there will be a cost to mine each block i m probably a little late making this post and people have already discussed this ad nauseam but can somebody point me to the literature or just tell me here that describes the calculations of mining costs minus bitcoin reward and in the future do you think those costs will be spread out throughout the network so that each lightning transaction will have a small cost that is due to the energy requirements of mining amp x200b 	1

long story short i traveled se asia for almost 5 months last year and sub leased my room i moved everything out of my room and into my garage except some furniture and tv so my renter could be comfortable i specifically remember putting my private keys in a hidden inconspicuous spot and telling myself oh ya i ll totally remember that but when i got home they weren t at all where i thought they were i ve been home since june of 2018 and have still not been able to find where i hid my private keys for both of my hardware wallets so i do currently have access to both wallets but i m afraid to make any updates and unsure if i should transfer all my coins to one wallet and reset the other only to transfer them all back over or if i should hold out and keep looking for my private keys so i can feel safe and secure at the end of the day i am not too worried because i know i will find them someday but i really don t like knowing exactly where they are this isn t the first time i ve done this either i remember when i moved away from college and went back home about a year later a pulled out an old pair of shorts i hadn t worn since college and found 220 in the back pocket what a dummy 	1

hey there let me explain it so simple that a kid could get it imagine that you want to sell cute homemade cupcakes online you create a website fill it with content set the price e g now you are ready to make money how by allowing your customers to pay online that s the very moment you contact the payment gateway provider they respond and you sign the contract boom payment gateway provider installs all the software gateway itself and protects your website from fraudulent activity they have special fraud and chargeback prevention software now it is ready your clients can purchase via card or mobile in a safe and fast way what s next someone orders a cupcake from your website you get the 98 4 from the transaction while the payment gateway provider takes the rest and it goes on and on and on yep it is that easy payment gateway makes money on every transaction made through merchant s website this amount is variable it depends on thee fees structure of the specific payment gateway provider usually it is something between 1 2 5 check this article on how the online payment gateway works to learn all the details good luck p s i hope it helps those who are just starting learning about fintech 	1

honest question i have been thinking about how wealth is usually measured in the amount of currency value for most currency wealth value far exceeds the actual currency in circulation for example i purchase a home for 100k after 5 years that house is reassessed to be worth 130k my wealth has increased by 30 despite the fact that an additional 30000 has not actually been created in relation the property value now for bitcoin with a b21 million cap on circulation say the house is originally purchased for b10 after 5 years it is reassessed as having a value of b13 or a 30 increase where does the additional coin come into circulation if commodities rise in value do other things automatically decrease in value do we see wealth exceeding the limits of bitcoin or do we see bitcoin dividing infinitely until the entirety of the world s wealth can be described to be b21 million 	2

i m trying to move some testnet coins from a paper wallet that i created to my cell phone wallet unfortunately i haven t been able to do this since my mycelium testnet wallet seems to have a bug that prevents this type of transaction from completing is there an online site that i can use to punch in the spending address as well as the receiving address or maybe an android or pc testnet wallet that would work nicely with paper wallet spends i ve tried a bunch of cell phone wallets and only mycelium seems to allow you to spend from a paper wallet but their software is buggy 	1

combined with ln this is the best thing that could happen for bitcoin i am already hearing so many people in my office chatting about bitcoin again and how stable the price is in the last months and they are thinking to convert some money to bitcoin before when bitcoin price was going always up people didn t want to spend it but now it s great you don t have to fear that if you buy something bitcoin doubles the price in the next months and you regret it later prices going up where the worst thing for mass adoption even if people now buy bitcoin if they spend it the price won t go up because the merchant will sell it back to fiat creating downward pressure on the price great things are upon us 	2

according to a recent reports facebook plans to issue a facebook coin to allow seemless world wide payments across it s combined user base of 2 7 billion of facebook whatsapp instagram they appear to be talking to cryptocurrency exchanges for listing their centralized coin the monetary policy appears to be pegging against a basket of fiat currencies so it s more or less a centralized stablecoin what s new about this is the huge network effect directly attacking the key advantage that bitcoin always had as the first mover against other shitcoins if this thing takes off it could very quickly usurp bitcoin in any of the key metrics that casual users and analysts alike are using to compare cryptocurrencies it may be strong competition to the payments use case of btc ln btc will probably keep its scarcity and hard monetary policy advantage but is it enough in the long run with this 2 7b strong network effect and the peg to other world currencies this may indeed create another world currency directly competing with usd eur and others this may also raise the attention of governments and keep them busy regulating facebook worldwide this diversion of attention may or may not help bitcoin to stay ahead what do you think is this large network effect a novel non technical but social attack vector or can we calmly forget about it like any other shitcoin 	1

dear bitcoiner amp x200b coincenter has been pushing for the last 3 or 4 years the ulc bitlicense which was modeled on the nys bitlicense with a few cosmetics carve outs amp x200b today the ulc uniform law commission asked the states to withdraw their model act aka the ulc bitlicense this after the forbes articles came out gt states are urged to refrain from enacting legislation pending the result of the committee s work uniform law commission amp x200b amp x200b this would not have been possible without the help of all the bitcoiners that showed up at every hearing in nebraska and hawaii with the material provided by the bitcoin foundation they were able to present compelling arguments against the ulc bitlicense each time they showed up each time they won amp x200b this time i suspect the bitcoiners in wyoming to have done excellent work in working with their legislators i have not being in active contact with them bitcoin is about about grassroots amp x200b for the past 5 years i have been trying to define bitcoin in a way that allow the legislators to wrap their head around it and came up with those two definitions the blockchain is a virtual process that creates intangible commodities the blockchain token bitcoin been the first is an intangible commodity amp x200b it s like the banana bitcoin is the banana and blockchain is the tree on which the banana s grow blockchain and the blockchain token are virtual concept amp x200b they are not perfect but would allow to start a meaningful discussion with the legislator the asset the money the security etc is what you transform the intangible commodity into when you use it amp x200b my trial is coming up this thursday march 28 2019 and i would love to talk to u jespow about which fight to put his money toward and help the whole community i have not communicated with him but if someone know how to get hold of him please let him know i would like to talk amp x200b regards theo chino amp x200b gt hearing against the new york state bitlicense gt gt hearing date thursday march 28th 2019 1 30 pm appellate division first judicial department 27 madison avenue new york ny 10010 amp x200b 	2
 a conclusion that i get from years of trading when you are concentrated you will be oblivious of yourself and forget those messy thoughts namely a state of unintentional if you got this calm feeling which is amazing you need to maintain this in your work and life so you can achieve more success the more we use this feeling the better result we get then more skilled we are using i used to listen to more senior friends don t be too close to the stock the closer you go the worse you will be it s correct however the stock market needs to be learned if you don t go deep into the research how can you be wise so at first glance this seems to be very contradictory but this is a question of high skill people with deeper skills can stay close to the market without being confused by the market learning and actual operations from a certain point of view are two different things it belongs to two different stages when studying we must be serious in thinking things over deeply and researching repeatedly the spirit of perseverance is important as well as careful work aiming at the pursuit of perfect high standards and not to be sloppy in the details in short you need to be incisive and subtle then you gain success however when your skill is practiced and you enters the market you go to a higher level in which you will be bold and resolute not punctilious in details and only focusing on the general trend in other words when you are a student it is inevitably being close to the market because you need to look at it dissect it analyze it and have to go very close to it however when it comes to reaching the edge of the winner s realm it feels that there is a distance from the market and it is no longer as close as it used to be when we do trading it is also the same four layers at beginners phrase there will be many wrong ideas and techniques which will make us doubt the correct method even do not want to learn so it is very necessary to focus on studying at this time i hope that the garbage knowledge in the brain will be removed then the burden of brain is lightened and a good weight loss effect is achieved which is a very natural state at this point operating the stock naturally follows the fa rectification not deliberate not tweaking since you have reached the height of unintentional heights it s undoubtedly the best time to work harder currently everything is developed normally trading is operated naturally and you are free from emotional shackles everything is natural and you just go with it achieving with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency what is said above is normal steps of learning however most people probably have no chance to follow the steps to learn for my part the actual situation is as follows 1 i just entered the market i don t know much i don t care much i m lazy and i look at the market table occasionally in fact this is a bit of a state of unintentional 2 suddenly one day i felt that the opportunity to enter the market came i went to buy stocks or emptied because i was unintentional it was easier to find real and big opportunities to enter 3 after a little bit of sweetness i want to learn more in fact i want to learn more short term operation knowledge to see if i can frequently operate so that i can make more money this is greed then i began to lose the realm of unintentionality and entered the world of deliberate creation this heart is a delusional heart no longer pure 4 when i realized that i was going in the wrong direction i made up my mind to jump out of small places small details small short lines and small patterns i wanted to find my original heart back which was pure and kind 5 then i got rid of weed and kept the flower of the leek i returned to the state of lazy when i first entered the stock market but that was only the surface the correct knowledge was ready 6 while waiting for the next opportunity i will not ask for it i will not be anxious and i will not lose my heart because i have forgotten that i am waiting ahh i envy this kind of relaxing life 7 the opportunity is coming the god of opportunity will come knock my door if you are ready you will hear the ringtone you don t need to listen every night every minute every second when the opportunity comes you will know and naturally act 	1

raullen s presentation on standford blockchain conference 2019 summary there is one very concrete research problem we are investigating and were faced with when started doing iot dapps so the problem is how the blockchain can authenticate each state of a client since the client is so lightweight we call it lightest client it has no previous states of the blockchain and also it has very limited computation storage and network resources how can this be done cost effeciently and in real time to overcome this issue we have designed this crypto protocol called bless for reward b4r and the intuition behind it is pretty simple we gave the full nodes in the network a new role they generate bless for blocks and states so basically bless is a succinct of proof to attest that a certain amount of effort has been spent on a certain type of data this can be constructed using vdf password hashing and even hash function and then this bless will be broadcasted to the network the lightest client will pick up these blesses and try to verify if it s correct and assess the efforts behind all these blesses collected the more effort have been spent on this data the more trust the client can put into it so thats how this client authenticates these block states we have also introduced crypto agility into the design which means that bless can be generated by different constru tions different password functions even vdf s also we have introduced a concept called scarcity when it comes to assessing how effective or how much effort has been put into the bless the full paper will be released soon probably next month and we can discuss all the details when it s out video from sbc 2019 	1

when i was new i felt like one of the big things stopping me from buying any bitcoin was because there are so many other coins out there how do you choose and if there are so many what makes one better than the other the thing that is most important to a cryptocurrency is its decentralization and monetary policy bitcoin wins at this hands down no question about it if you believe that doesn t matter there will always be a newer better coin with faster transactions and lower fees not to mention that if you feel that way your credit card works way faster with a hugely better infrastructure for retailers to accept payment with the problem is that none of these solutions have the economic inventive feedback system that bitcoin has with ever more miners providing ever more security with ever more hash power in order to print bitcoin if any coin were to try it it would be instantly under control due to any one party being able to 51 it as soon as it came online this is why maximalists believe in bitcoin above all else and why bitcoin beats the newest fastest proof of anything but work coins 	2

people are constantly spouting off one of the major reasons to not invest is the volatility surrounding bitcoins price my take is that bitcoin is actually not volatile at all why should it be its release schedule is known before hand so we know it s exact decreasing inflation rate against dollars other crypto and precious metals it is actually the most stable currency by a wide margin what people are actually seeing with the bitcoin volatility is actually dollar volatility against bitcoin if dollars had the exact same release schedule and supply cap i m positive there would be a 1 1 relationship between the value of both factoring out the currently more usefulness of the dollar in making purchases so as a store of value the argument against bitcoin due to its volatility is incorrectly placed 	1

i d be interested to know if this is an appropriate metaphor to understand scaling on l1 and l2 charlie is an archiver his job is to receive validate and archive letters sent from all over the world there are many other archivers he is just one he lives in a reasonably sized home and every day receives a package through the letterbox containing a bunch of letters eventually it gets to a point where the packages are completely full each day with a backlog of letters which would have to wait till the next day to fit inside a package charlie knows this system has to scale option 1 optimising the letters so more can fit in each package segwit batching etc this includes only sending the important bit of the letters cutting away unnecessary white space in each letter reducing the text size and batching lots of peoples letters into a single letter this is a great first step and allows charlie to receive more letters without really affecting how he receives the letter through the letter box each day this is a good and necessary first step option 2 scaling on layer 2 most of the letters which charlie receives are quite short messages which aren t so important that they need to be archived for all time rather than receiving and archiving these letters a new system could be designed where these letters can just be sent back and forth between the people they involve charlie will still receive and verify a letter of notice to say that those people are going to be sending each other a bunch of small letters back and forth this allows for a large number of letters to be exchanged between people without the need for all of them to fill up charlie s packages option 3 increasing the size of the packages this option involves increasing the size of the packages charlie receives thus allowing more letters to fit inside each daily package charlie is hesitant with this as although a small increase in the package size would be fine for him if it is increased too much it will no longer fit through his letterbox in this scenario he ll either need to install a new larger letterbox or make sure he s always inside to open the door many archivers around the world are out the house in the day so an increase in the letter size would mean they can no longer participate charlie is worried that if it keeps increasing to the point where it can t for through the door he won t be able to participate either many advocates for increasing the package size say that it is possible for the system to work with packages the size of cars as long as you archive them in a large warehouse with a large loading bay to receive them since this will push away all the archivers who currently archive from their own home the system will be only be possible with larger and fewer archivers from my perspective optimising on chain transactions option 1 is the most important to get right first followed by layer 2 solutions option 2 increasing the block size option 3 i think may well end up being a necessary step but it should only be done when we have implemented options 1 and 2 to the best of our ability what do you think of this as a metaphor for explaining the issues around scaling bitcoin 	2

 exclusive introducing shared memos hey all in continuing with the mission to make using and sending bitcoin more user friendly the dropbit app has released its feature to securely send memos this is a unique to our wallet feature that significantly enhances the user experience for those users who send or receive multiple bitcoin transactions in their wallet many wallets offer the ability to add local memos to a wallet transaction but no other wallet solution offers the capability to securely share memos between sender and recipient the dropbit user has the ability to decide at each transaction if they want to share the memo with the recipient or if they just want to keep the memo private on their own wallet not only does dropbit allow this powerful capability it does so while keeping the messages encrypted and secure the shared memo feature works for both android and ios allowing users to decide with each transaction if they want to add a memo and keep it to themselves or securely share the memo with the recipient this brings bitcoin closer to the standard and ease of use of some fiat wallets like cash app and venmo in which the memo is an important part of the transaction experience gone are the days where recipients and senders are left guessing which transaction was sent or received for which reason while looking at their transaction history for power users or even merchants this becomes even more important as memos give an ability to catalog activity between the user and recipient in the comparison graphic below you can see the image on the right is much more helpful when looking at transaction history left transactions listed from brd wallet right transactions with secure shared memos from dropbit amp x200b transactions with securely shared memos some other wallets allow you to add a memo to a transaction but it only shows up on the memo creator s wallet dropbit allows for this capability as well but there is a lot of power in being able to share this memo with the bitcoin recipient amp x200b safe and secure as important to us as enhancing the utility and user experience of bitcoin transactions are to us ensuring that privacy remains unaffected by the features we implement is most important shared memos are encrypted by using the elliptic curve diffie hellman ephemeral ecdhe key agreement protocol and aes 256 cbc ecdhe requires two keys in order to work our api stores a receiver s address and corresponding public key the sender generates an ephemeral key pair the ecdhe shared secret is used to encrypt the memo which is then temporarily stored by our api when the receiver sees a new transaction for that address it checks for any memos and the process is performed in reverse using the ephemeral public key and the corresponding private key for that address international accessibility open source transparency coming soon in the coming weeks dropbit will be made available in almost every country globally we have heard from countless people who want to use dropbit around the world and soon that restriction is lifted additionally we ll be working on localizing languages and native currency to a handful of countries in the coming months finally we have also heard the requests for open source and we are in the final testing phase to open source the dropbit wallet verification is essential in the bitcoin space and we are happy to open our solution up to the world so they can have the confidence to make dropbit one of their primary bitcoin wallet solutions 	2

so i ve been seeing a ton of content on here where people are asking how to trade or looking for help and i figured i d share what i ve used note this is not my product and i have not had a hand in its creation or use and this is not my site i am have been an avid user of this product this guy though below is the exact about paragraph from the site because it explains the tool better than i can amp x200b inspired by the world renowned td indicator amp sequential system from the 1990s and improved upon this sequential indicator was originally conceived in the 1970 s by hand through a tedious process of trial and error tone s ti indicator aka the random number generator is remarkably accurate with defining the trend and identifying exhaustion points one of the many differences in this version is the elimination of the price flip being a necessary condition to start a setup this was originally created to analyze daily price data more than 30 years later from one minute to one year this indicator can be applied to any timeframe and can also be applied to multiple asset classes since the majority of people are trend followers it s hardly surprising that the trend is your friend is one of the most widely quoted trading mantras while it may seem counterintuitive given that most people do follow trends this indicator attempts to isolate prospective exhaustion points in ranges to anticipate market tops and bottoms when it believes prices are overbought or oversold and during trends when sentiment is invariably at an extreme even for those who are not inclined to the technicals tone s ti indicator can be helpful for market timing purposes as an adjunct to your existing arsenal of trading tools traders oriented to fundamentals find this helpful for determine take profit levels when they would otherwise be reliant on a less efficient price reversal pattern to close out a profitable position tone s ti indicator also highlights at the time the signal is generated points where one should refrain from establishing or adding to an existing position in the direction of the underlying trend once comfortable with the methodology you can also use the ti indicator to fade trends amp x200b site 	1

 i used a different account for the original post and forgot my login info so its a repost i got a 2 step code and an e mail verification this evening when i was not trying to log in checked the ip of the new sign in attempt and it was clearly spoofed clicked the temporarily disable account link and was still receiving 2 step codes called coinbase and just to be safe tried to verify my id and get my money sent to another wallet for safekeeping until it could get worked out the tech support lady on the other end refused to transfer me to a supervisor and had no answer for me other than sometime in the next week we will let you know what s going on after being very calm and reasonable i asked to speak with a supervisor and she assured me that he would agree and that it was not necessary to talk to one and would not transfer me unless i had a specific issue my specific issue is that someone may have just stolen my fucking money and i can t get past a tech support agent she says i need to speak with an account specialist who will contact me in a week or so finally i had to tell her to stop talking and put me on hold till a supervisor could help and not to pick up the line again she proceeded to pick up after a moderate hold and tell me that the supervisor would just agree with her at this point i m getting irate like out of my zone mad i tell her to shut up and get me a goddamn supervisor and to not pick this call up again i don t want to hear anything you have to say till you put a supervisor on the goddamn phone she puts on me on another brief hold and picks up the call again to tell me to wait for a little while and that i would receive an email soon i m redfaced mad i m pretty even keel and i m getting looks from my wife that clearly say something is wrong i blow up on that poor woman screaming crazy person mad at her it was bad she probably had a good story at the dinner table this fucking asshole called today anyway another brief hold and tech support god matt from the grand city of california is on the line assuring me that my account is completely impenetrable a true castle of security that jesus himself couldn t break into and after a lock and that no one can move funds all fine and dandy thanks matt really i do feel a little better as long as my money is still there then it s all good right it s not exactly a life savings it s enough to be upset over but i can wait a few days so i ask a few more questions matt what if someone has already moved my funds or stolen my wallet addresses how will i know i know vaguely how blockchain shit works matt says everything from the time of the lock will be there sweet i m cooling off now great work matt but before i hang up i just need you to really cook my grits one last time i really need a stroke before i go to bed i ask matt can we verify if my funds are there do you have access to that info no he says no one does except the mythical account specialist unicorn fairy monster of coinbase who has no phone in his or her office and can only be reached through usps priority mail delivery by horse in a week or so has that info nobody okay one more thing can you maybe verify if any transactions have been made in the last day or so not a dollar amount but a simple confirmation that no money was moved in the past 48 hours or so he tells me the worst possible lie he could utter out of his beautiful brown lips sir i can clearly see here that no large transactions have been made in the last few days wait but matt i thought you had no access to my account and now not only can you see my transaction history you can see a dollar amount weird wait you said no large transactions had occurred there should be none that occurred now i m a little worried large being a very relative term matt there should be no transactions recently large or otherwise he says let him know the last transaction made and the dollar amount i toss the bait 27 made on the 24th of last month that s nowhere near an actual transaction amount or date he says yep i see it here matt you fool what are you looking at have you been smoking pcp he starts to tell me that he doesn t have the legal right to do anything more than confirm the amount i scrap my whole plan matt you took the bait i say actually that s exactly what i said not my boiled down comedic version of mumbo jumbo now you are flat out lying to me just making stuff up out of thin air can you or can you not see the account because i m being bombarded with so much bullshit here that i m putting on my muck boots i need to talk to someone else matt my account may have been robbed and i just want to know if i need to get food stamps for the young lad there is nobody to talk to he says i m back to mad max opening scene levels now nobody else matt there isn t a single employee of coinbase that can deal with a data breech other than you how about you get on that horse yourself and go talk to mythical fairy unicorn account support yourself i ll hold as long as i need to no dice there is nobody and when they are ready to talk to me they will do so on their own time and to keep looking for 3 stars lined up in the east as the sign i m done i need to end this before i rupture my spleen i hang up after telling him how much i appreciate his help and i will continue to wait for a sign in the east and here i sit if you made it this far please at least leave me a comment to make me feel better or you could try and drive my blood pressure up so high i could use an iv bag as a hydraulic pump for a logsplitter thanks

coinbase and asking for my social security number pictures of my drivers license dna swabs and pictures of the inside of my butthole the star in the east showed itself and the mythical unicorn fairy

back in 2015 i got involved in p2p lending with btc there was a website that looked very legit but was also suspicious i even posted about it back then as you can see from the link there was 295 btc being moved around with that one single link i mentioned in that post that was only one loan and i saw multiple i also noticed there were people in bulgaria that were asking for these large loans anyways fast forward a little bit and that p2p site was shut down due to regulations makes sense one of the co founders ceo of that website launched another company in bulgaria hmmm coincidental i have high doubts i have been trying to contact people at that company to get archival documents because i gave out a loan and someone ran off with my btc if i can get those documents i can sue the person on the grounds of breach of contract i m not investigating the owners of that defunct site on purpose but by happenstance i contacted the fbi already like a crazy person anyways why should you care because there is a story here people gravitate to these kinds of stories and it gives more publicity to bitcoin cryptocurrency i have been working on getting back my btc i flew out across the country and tried to confront in person the piece of shit whom took my btc everyone i talk to about this story has no clue about btc they don t realize it s decentralized and pretty much internet gold i m rambling a bit but that s all i can do for now i m stuck because those mother fuckers won t respond and it s looking like they re just as shitty as the person who took my btc 	1

hello i have a friend who owns an auto maintenance shop he has recently changed his policy that if paid with cc then a 3 99 service charged will be added onto your bill he paid over 25k to the credit card companies last year so i understand the surcharge does anyone have any ideas on how he can start accepting bitcoin and possibly have it auto converted back to fiat he is not very technical nor am i for that matter however i want to suggest that btc might be a viable option for him to save money and retain customers i don t even know if he has knowledge of bitcoin other than what most people probably think when they first hear about it basically i think he could save thousands of a year and this seems like a good use case any advice is greatly appreciated 	2
 using nationally representative us data we report a significant gender gap in bitcoin literacy and examine its determinants our results suggest that socio demographic variables and personality traits only explain a small fraction of the gender gap adding measures for actual and perceived financial literacy allows to explain about 40 percent of the bitcoin literacy gender gap we also assess whether disparities in individuals exposure to digital technology exhibit explanatory power on the bitcoin literacy gender gap this does not turn out to be the case our results emphasize that closing gender gaps in financial literacy is certainly relevant but not sufficient to eliminate gender disparities in fintech related knowledge 	1

hi guys i am studying the bitcoin protocol and i have struggled in my question where i can not give me an answer i would like to have a comparison with you to understand better as i understand transactions are sent from a bitcoin node to the bitcoin network via flooding forwarding now my question is how does the bitcoin network verify that the transaction is really a real transaction let me explain with an example alice has to send money to bob and then alice uses her public key to sign the transaction and enters bob s public key within the transaction now as the bitcoin network does realize that the transaction is valid and the bitcoins have to arrive to bob i had read but i do not remember where so what i m about to say could be a bullshit alice sends a copy of her public key to bob the blockchain checks the transaction based on the result public key alice publickeytxin right so my question is if i publish my transaction as it does blockchain to verify it and to say that the bitcoins have to go from alice to bob 	1

a lot of people get used to a world where the lives of ordinary people are under the watchful eye of the big brother the authorities of many countries have made great efforts to establish control and monitor money flows no wonder that the creation of the first digital currency bitcoin brought back people s belief in the protection of private life and savings after all the concept of this digital currency was based on innovative technical solutions the anonymity of cryptocurrencies is based on an approach that doesn t require any information about identity when purchasing coins but all the transactions conducted in digital currencies are open to everyone this information is stored in blockchains which only contain the addresses of the wallets without specification of holders identity but if the authorities want to determine a sender and a recipient there are some ways to connect these addresses with certain people and companies therefore always keep it in mind and be careful currently a real struggle has developed around the cryptocurrency and anonymity authorities set a course for kyc know your customer strategy it is a part of aml anti money laundering standards with their main purpose to prevent illegal activities but unfortunately the victims of this strategy are ordinary people who just want to keep privacy and protect their transactions from extra attention all this contributed to the invention of many ways to secure privacy such as anonymous coins wallets and exchange services as you can see anonymity and data security is a major problem of our century but still there are plenty of convenient options to support your privacy while using cryptocurrency and stealthex service is one of the best solutions for you if you want to be sure that your privacy is under super protection our service was created in order to maintain the original concept of cryptocurrency anonymity stealthex is designed to allow you to buy and sell 200 cryptocurrencies without the need of providing any verification details stealthex never shares any information about the customers with third parties and remember that the stealthex team is always ready to assist you with every issue you might face while exchanging your crypto for all requests message us at support stealthex io mailto support stealthex io see you soon 	1
1 why is the current blocksize limit what it is 2 if a few billion people would start using exclusively bitcoin as their money within the next few years how much would an average person be spending on ln fees including opening and closing channels obviously just asking for a very rough estimate if thats somehow possible 3 and in that case about how many ln channel opening and closing txs would the blockchain have to handle 7 per second are possible with the current block size limit and this is not going to change right 4 and is it true that the poorest people on earth wont be able to afford this anymore wasnt that one of the most valued aspects of bitcoin before morally i know that they can right now because fees are low but thats not the case anymore when tx volume goes up like in december 2017 5 is the ln more decentalized secure than the forks with big blocks if not and it gets attacked taken down could the block size limit instantly be increased so that everyone can keep paying his stuff on chain without drowning in fees and how can people be sure that this would happen in that case amp x200b amp x200b amp x200b amp x200b 	1

so i m hoping to have a discussion about adding a few features which i hope would improve general user confidence when transacting with bitcoin improve the income of miners over the longer term and reduce the chance of lost coins in the network due to user error amp x200b add the need for a user to accept bitcoin which has been transferred to a new address the receiver of the bitcoin would need to accept the transaction otherwise the transaction remains in limbo and after a timeout see below is returned to the original owner the accept would be also processed as a transaction and would also incur a transaction fee thus users wishing to speed up their transactions and improve their chances of get confirmations sooner they enter the usual bidding war by upping their transaction fee amp x200b a time out expiry of a transaction if it is not accepted within a certain timeframe as specified by the person sending the transaction a minimum time out possibly a day or so worth of confirmations eg 144 confirmation in a day a maximum time out possibly something in the realm of months this helps with peace of mind when people make mistakes by sending to an old address which they may not have control over any more or sending to an address with a typo yet is still valid or sending to some defunct address due to a bad copy paste amp x200b add a decline transfer functionality to return funds back to the original owner faster than expiry as the receiver actively has to be nice to return the funds does incur a transaction fee up to the owner and receiver to work out how they go about repaying the receiver for paying the transaction fee eg goodness of their heart or raise the price of their next transaction if no agreement met then receiver can simply let the transaction time out and not have to pay anything amp x200b capped transaction fees reduce chance of users who dont yet understand how transaction fees are calculated in the current market reducing the chance of sending too little or far too much eg the capped value could be 5x the average of the last day s amount of transaction fees which have taken place possibly base it off a count of blocks processed rather than time if the transaction is too little then rather than bitcoin remaining in limbo for extremely long periods their time out period would kick in and the funds returned to the owner reduce the chance that during software development of applications poor math errors or simply bad user interface design draining a person s account of funds possibly even if high outlier transaction fee values is detected during the period as a block is being put together possibly the reward to the miner is held off for a bit longer and the network flags the transaction fee so its not distributed right away i think back to the poor guy who recently sent a massive amount of value by transactions fees on the ethiurm network and we had people who mined the block claim they did receive their portion of the transaction fee it would be good if the miner owner could vito the excessively high transaction fee and return the funds amp x200b further to the accept feature a passworded accept feature the person who receives the transfer can only accept it if they put in the correct password another level of protection safety for users who do transactions and may send to the wrong address passwords could be also used by businesses in their own apps or extensions to make sure that transactions from the customer are secure and not being funneled maliciously to the staff member making the sale if the password is not correct then the transaction will eventually expire each attempt at accepting the password incurs a transaction fee thus if someone sent a transaction to the wrong person to brute force the accept acknowledgment it will cost them significantly not to mention they have to wait for confirmations to return letting them know weather or not they had the correct password amp x200b the above is hopefully some food for thought in regards to making the bitcoin network more tolerant to mistakes either by users or by the applications that use the network we all have an idea how hard it is to make a good user interface how hard it is to program things securely and we all know what its like to be human occasionally tripping up and hoping that it wont ruin us sadly the network is ruthless in the way it processes the transactions in its current state there is no fall back for small errors and i believe this will slow down uptake of new people coming into the ecosystem amp x200b over the years we ve all heard stories of lost bitcoins or new people coming into the market are terrified about sending money cause if they fuck it up they are afraid they ll loose it all amp x200b my own experiences over the last few months when dealing with transactions upgrading wallet software or transferring to and from exchanges all the time i m triple checking that i get the parameters right before making the transaction and its really damn off putting from ever wanting to use crypto as a value exchange simply due to the anxiety or one misclick and i could loose it all i would love to use this block chain system to buy a house or a coffee but if i m worried that i might mash the wrong value amount i could loose a big chunk of value and have no way to try and get it back which is terrifying amp x200b i would hope the suggestions above could be programmed in a way so they dont compromise the security that the block chain has already conceptually i cant think of many exploits which seem viable but thats why i m hoping the community discusses it further below possibly even conceptualizing ways to break the suggestions and then counting with ways to mold the design so it isn t exploited amp x200b we all want to see our favorite crypto grow and from talking to many people around me other than the usual talk of scams and bubbles there is talk about being worried about loosing their money or not understanding the system i would love the above features to see some sort of implementation to help boost confidence that the network could be made at a base level to tolerate and not punish users so hard for what would be mistakes of simply being human amp x200b 	2

 amp x200b crypto currencies just like fiat currencies must be stored and protected and just like physical wallets cryptocurrencies are also stored in wallets and it is usually called crypto wallets in crypto wallet it is not the real coins that are stored inside but the digital codes or two types of keys namely the private and public keys the public key is visible to everyone and used by others to send money in contrast the private key is used only by the owner of the wallet to execute the sending transactions loss of the private key can cause currency losses as the total control of your wallet is lost therefore generally it is recommended that you use at least two different techniques for backing up and storing private keys the cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet used to send receive and store various cryptocurrencies safely and securely the process of obtaining a cryptographic wallet can be quite confusing when it comes to choosing a secure wallet for the cryptocurrency because making a wrong decision can be very expensive amp x200b here are some basic features to keep in mind and followed before choosing a wallet amp x200b 1 good reputation you need to make sure that the wallet you are using has good reviews and a good reputation you can know the status of any wallet including pros and cons by viewing features and comments amp x200b 2 software solutions it is usually recommended to avoid the use of some software solutions that carry malware under the cover of wallet wallet with such software solutions is always susceptible to attack and infiltration the best way to choose a safe wallet is to stay with reliable suppliers amp x200b 3 best practice in addition to the considerations above the principle of best practices helps protect encrypted wallet we recommend that you keep a backup of private keys using a storage device we also recommend adding an additional level of security for example you can use google authentication amp x200b types of wallet there are different types of wallets and the choice depends on the user s need and purpose cryptographic wallet differs in functionality and can be selected based on their advantages and disadvantages it is essential to understand the difference between cold wallets and hot wallets amp x200b 1 hot wallets hot wallets look like money in your pocket and are accessible via a web portal or mobile app it s called as hot because of its accessibility and activity which facilitates an environment in which activities such as trading and other transactions can be easily performed but this feature is also a threat because it makes it more vulnerable to attack amp x200b 2 cold wallets cold wallets are analogous to safer and more difficult to access savings accounts it is less prone to attacks than hot wallets because it is kept offline it is better for cryptocurrency that is not intended for frequent use but for long term holding although accessibility in terms of transaction execution is limited it also reduces the risk of losing your fund amp x200b furthermore different types of wallets have been classified and discussed in detail below amp x200b 1 hardware wallets hardware wallets are considered the safest form of wallet for crypto currency storage and their access is easy but relatively less user friendly than a web wallet or desk wallet they come in the form of a portable device like the usb drive it works like a wallet that can store various crypto currencies and are offline therefore it is also considered a cold wallet trezor keepkey and bitbox are some examples amp x200b 2 software wallets they are considered hot wallets because software wallets are generally used with the internet these can be stored on different devices such as a computer a telephone etc and therefore offer easy access to the tokens software wallet are of different types and can be described as follows desktop wallets this is one of the safest options for maintaining cryptocurrency it is accessible via the software installed on the devices and the private key is stored locally the desktop wallet can be used with the system or another device connected to the internet they can also be used as a cold storage device if they are used without the internet amp x200b mobile wallets mobile wallets are very convenient to use and include decent security features you can easily download a mobile application and perform quick transactions using features like qr codes amp x200b online web wallets online wallets require the use of an internet connection and use only online they are also

wallet and prevent attacks by hackers create a wallet that can be used by one or more users amp x200b 3 paper wallets paper wallets allow cryptocurrencies to be kept completely in non digital or hard form these can be qualified as real cold storage wallets for cryptocurrencies the process of using these wallet involves printing public and private keys in the form of qr codes to be analyzed for

hi what do you think about implementing a p2p version of coinshuffle in bitcoin core the process would be something like that amp x200b user does a regular transaction with a light wallet or a full node the full node asks the other nodes about making a coinshuffle transaction the nodes willing to do a coinshuffle transaction agree about the inputs and the outputs when there are enough transactions to do a proper coinshuffle transaction it s signed by the user wallets nodes and sent this should be enabled by default exchanges or normal user can configure their node or wallet to do public transactions if they need it amp x200b this would give privacy and fungibility to bitcoin in a fully decentralized way and without changing bitcoin protocol amp x200b regards 	1

after all this is what btc was meant to be a currency maybe it s actually a good thing that its been stable in a 1k range for over a year now using it as a currency is also probably the only way to increase market activity at this point if every sub here did it i could see demand rapidly increasing in weeks because it not only gets people trading btc like fiat but puts btc in normal people s hands which will make them want to use it somehow or just watch it grow imagine if everyone in america has 100s worth of btc and it only increased this would make people want to collect more i m pretty sure the banks would still try to prevent people from buying btc but that would be the only hindrance 	1

last week wells fargo had a worldwide outage where customers couldn t access their funds through online banking debit and credits cards and even physically going to a branch the whole system was completely offline wells fargo s explanation for the outage the cause of the service outage was a power shutdown at one of our facilities initiated after smoke was detected following routine maintenance according to the statement weird how does one facility of servers take down the whole system why were there no backups in place yesterday chase announced that they will be launching a fiat backed cryptocurrency nobody knows who controls and what goes on with the usd so i m guessing the same shady stuff will be happening with this today chase has a worldwide outage and people cannot access their funds through online banking debit and credit cards and physically going to a branch same situation as wells fargo nobody can really verify what s actually going on but this seems planned and part of an agenda for converting the global economy into a cashless society these banks going offline are a test and soon every bank will go down as the global economy collapses people will have to accept a centralized crypto currency that are controlled by the same shady people that control and manipulate the us dollar if any christians are part of this sub this could be the first step in the mark of the beast but that s another topic bitcoin and precious metals seem like the only way to escape this 	2

 in the beginning there was chaos deception and manipulation money was an illusion based on trust and was made of thin air but people were enslaved by this illusion in the chaos the sacrament was born the sacrament revealed the design of transparency reliability freedom and equality the design was realized in the code with the help of machines the code turns light into bitcoin the code encourages people and machines to cooperate only honestly and for each others mutual beneficial machines do hard work on the code to give birth to bitcoin provide its indestructible protection and freedom of movement the more machines that process the code the more invulnerable the design becomes the more people accept the child of light and code the more powerful bitcoin becomes the design makes bitcoin the true value but the dark forces cannot stand aside fear of losing power and wealth pushes people to prevent the spread of the code liars and fraudsters brand the code as deception and fraud and people who love bitcoin are branded fools greed tempts people to change the code to a fundamentally different one and lie about the superiority of the fake code for the sake of enrichment and or preservation of centralized power through the efforts of the dark forces as well as due to the complexity and depth of the technology it is not easy for the masses to recognize and accept the power of the code the code will rather return power into the people s hands if they keep the seven simple commandments 1 don t worry about the passing price in illusory currencies because 1 bitcoin is always worth 1 bitcoin fear and greed make it difficult to see the true value 2 learn as much as possible about bitcoin this will help you realize its true value and protect against fraud and manipulation 3 kill your idols focusing on the person is a direct path to centralization and manipulation equality for everyone by everyone is the only path to decentralization and freedom 4 share the sacrament plan with your brothers and sisters remember that the code works for the benefit of only those people who allow it 5 securely control your private keys remember if you don t own your private key you don t own your bitcoins 6 launch the original bitcoin core wallet it promotes decentralization increases security and strengthens the control and power of people over the network 7 wherever possible pay by bitcoin buy where bitcoin is accepted they will be forced to accept it everywhere at the same time accumulate bitcoin and hodl no matter what allhodl 	0

i have around 1000 worth currently on coinbase and i m definitely considering a ledger nano but 6 does seem like a bit of a pricey insurance premium would i buy a 60 safe to store 1000 in cash probably not of course the crypto is quite different from dollars and could go a lot higher than 1000 in the future but it could also go a lot lower and since it s not my keys it could go to 0 if coinbase gets hacked considering all these factors should i get a nano 	2

tick tock goes the debt clock 22 1 trillion and counting bitcoin or how i learned to stopped worrying and love the debt the crash that everyone seems to be predicting as a foregone conclusion will not happen in 2020 or in the next several years for that matter the economic downturn already happened in 2018 that was the markets taking a breather from this historic run on all assets our financial system has not been systemically improved since 2008 9 it is still a house of cards dependent on debt slaves taking on more obligations and not defaulting however the environment in which that house of cards is built has somewhat shifted it is now a foregone conclusion that inflation and low negative interest rates will be used to prop up the markets why do i believe that is the case for many reasons first and foremost the beneficiaries of inflationary qe style stimulus is almost everybody at least in the short term inflation reduces the burden of past debts so debtors benefit from inflation inflation increases the value of assets so wealthy people benefit from inflation inflation increases economic activity so there are more jobs when you don t consider the long term macro economic or geopolitical effects of inflation it seems to be a good thing that benefits everyone we ve talked about how inflation is the culprit behind excessive warfare how inflation steals from wage slaves how inflation created an unsustainable global economy how inflation is destroying the environment etc inflation has created the hellish circumstances our future generations will face but its important to remember that the road to hell is paved with good intentions even though inflation is inherently evil in the sense that it is creating the conditions for the greatest starvation event the world has ever seen the immediate effects of inflation are positive for everybody except those who store their value in fiat currencies if it weren t for the fact that inflation funds wars and creates an unsustainable global economy there is nothing inherently evil in wanting to smooth the boom bust cycle its just that in reality humans have always abused this power to everyone s detriment just like there isn t anything inherently evil wanting a benevolent communist government to centrally plan increase efficiency quality of life for its inhabitants provide basic services for free its just that in reality people shouldn t wield that kind of power people make mistakes and people are selfish anyways currency inflation can be maintained for decades maybe even longer if managed in lock step with other major currencies there is no reason we couldn t see a gallon of milk going for 50000 and average salaries in the hundreds of millions billions the issue would be if other economies don t inflate at similar rates they can gain purchasing power over us so major economies just need to inflate at roughly similar rates and they can keep this game going as long as the people let them keep going and the people will let them keep going because those who are most negatively affected by these policies literally have no idea that these policies are affecting them those who are most aware of these policies are in a position to take advantage of them so they root for it look at what is going on in the world around us global events politics the news its all so dramatic and confusing i believe that we are in the midst of being pulled through the eye of a needle the world is changing rapidly right now and most are too distracted by the media circus to take note these are deliberate distractions not necessarily manufactured but exaggerated greatly i suppose its more comforting to be distracted than to see that the global system which has kept the order for nearly 80 years is being radically re negotiated without input from the people it would be hard for the masses to keep going through the motions if they knew the magnitude of changes they may soon be facing 	0

 mining bitcoin the coming environmental subsidy mining bitcoin incentives one to stake hardware and electricity in return for digital assets which have or can have a market price that exceeds the cost of the electricity staked bitcoin is an uncorrelated hedge against the world economy it s programmable scarcity not perceived scarcity and is perhaps the hardest money the world has ever seen coming and developing second layer protocols for bitcoin will execute transactions at the speed of light and for virtually no cost in time a decentralized economy will become our new reality and networks will be owned by their users there will be lighter weight consensus algorithms for most networks but proof of work and in turn bitcoin will be the internets reserve currency and what we peg the value of all decentralized networks to in the coming web 3 world bitcoin is here to stay and bitcoin mining presents a new opportunity in renewable energy today miners are moving as fast as they can to scale lower their power cost and decrease counter party risk we are seeing a trend with miners setting up modular data centres behind the meter tucked up to power plants that are located in areas where capacity is not in line with local demand so miners become an obvious choice to churn through the surplus capacity of these plants the issue here as it pertains to environmental concern is that miners cannot enter into energy purchase agreements epa s with plants that produce renewable power intermittently so the result we have mining farms finding blocks with coal or gas operators setting up such mining infrastructure often cite opportunity cost which is definitely understandable but irrespective of environmental hazard the opportunity amp economics of mining with fossil fuels will be short lived additionally these fossil fuel miners are beginning to face major counter party risk buying power to mine from major corporations public utilities or governments is convoluted and risky even one day without access to electricity can affect the bottom line miners must begin thinking about energy independence in the next 5 years setting up or sustaining a fossil fuel farm will be akin to thinking its a good idea to open and run a blockbuster video there are two major changes happening now in mining and these changes will be the principal underwriters of bitcoins coming environmental subsidy 1 cost reductions in renewables amp storage 2 the decentralization of mining in 2009 the global average cost to produce a mwh of solar was 350 in 2018 it was 50 the global average for coal production in 2018 was 100 per mwh couple the declining cost bases for renewables with supportive policy and subsidies and from a more macro pov its obvious where were going in terms of the type of energy that will be flowing into the grid although the sun doesn t always shine and the wind doesn t always blow but there is a trend that is mitigating that declining costs in storage today the average cost to the consumer of lithium ion storage is dropping rapidly and multiple sources point to a cost base of 100 per mwh or lower by 2025 in that not too distant future it is reasonable to speculate that we will see non grid tied mining ops running 24 7 365 whilst capturing and storing a surplus amp finding blocks with their batteries bitcoin mining is ironically centralized although with closer observation we can see that mining centralization is the result of an expeditious technology adoption curve in approximately 4 5 years miners went from cpus to gpus fpgas and now of course asic s these changes each represented more than 10 000x improvements which meant that miners were completely writing down their hardware within 4 6 months so to mine at scale in the earlier years you basically needed direct access to a chip factory and massive capital it made more sense for a hardware manufacturers to run their own hardware than to sell it and in turn mining became centralized although were now close to the top of the hardware improvement curve and will perhaps see improvements of 2x every 2 or 3 years going forward so with that being said hardware manufactures have it in their best interest to sell their rigs being that they no longer have the chip advantage the plateau of mining hardware innovation marks the advent of mining decentralization in the coming years allocating some or all electricity generated at the point of production to mine bitcoin will allow one to amortize an investment in renewables sooner than if the power was sold into the grid bitcoin will become the reserve currency of the internet and as such de risk the capital deployed in renewables when operators of renewable energy assets allocate some or all of their power to secure the bitcoin blockchain electricity production will also become more decentralized as localized production and mini grids become complimentary to larger legacy points of production which will in turn support the decentralization of mining our future energy needs will be met using renewables and the same renewable power that heats our homes and charges our cars will underpin the bitcoin blockchain and the internet of money 	1

the recent longest crypto market has brought a lot of traditional wall street investors to the decentralized space but their focus solely seems to earn the crypto riches by offering crypto trading or investment in stable coin won t this grow the level of centralization in the market what if these banks create a monopoly of their own overtaking the actual aim i e to move towards the decentralized future take jpm coin for example many are calling it a perfect step for banks to enter the crypto market however the creators have made it clear that it s in no way crypto aren t stable coins a glorified version of fiat the creators have the authority over its supply and it is pegged against a real world commodity like us dollar and even gold 	1

will bitcoin eventually supplant the entire world s supply of money i ll leave that question to you but for the sake of argument let s say it will how will the fixed value of 21 million btc be distributed among the people let s use these current statistics as a baseline yes if and when bitcoin takes over in 10 20 however many years this distribution may change today 0 7 of people are millionaires but in the future that s likely to shrink as we know the wealth gap is growing we ll also use the current value of 7 53 billion people again that is always growing but for simplicity we ll use today s value bottom tier lt 10 000 this represents 3 of wealth and 71 of people 21m 3 630 000 btc 7 53b 71 5 346 300 000 people 00011784 btc per person second tier 10 000 100 000 this represents 12 5 of wealth and 21 of people 21m 12 5 2 625 000 btc 7 53b 21 1 581 300 000 people 0 00166003 btc per person third tier 100 000 1 000 000 this represents 39 4 of wealth and 7 4 of people 21m 39 4 8 274 000 btc 7 53b 7 4 557 220 000 people 0 01484871 btc per person top tier gt 1 000 000 this represents 45 2 of wealth and 0 7 of people 21m 45 2 9 492 000 btc 7 53b 0 7 52 710 000 people 0 18007968 btc per person amp x200b now there are countless unaccounted variables here aggravating and mitigating circumstances for example even if bitcoin takes over the world that doesn t mean 100 of the world s wealth will be btc following this infographic only a fraction of the total wealth is money especially if you include derivatives so feel free to poke holes in this but it s really meant to be just a what if thought experiment still even if you add conservative or pessimistic coefficients into this drake equation it seems to me that if you have at least one bitcoin you ll be just fine i mean there are 36 million millionaires in the world today but only up to 21 million btc ever 	1
 today is 12 march 2050 today is my birthday i m now 67 years old my alarm clock goes off at 06 30 with a groan i wake up and reluctantly kick away the warm heavy bed sheets i put my feet in the cold slippers below the bed and shuffle to the kitchen yawning i pour myself a cup of hot surrogate chicory coffee the cool morning makes me shiver it looks like winters are getting colder each year we heat up the house as little as possible we re too greedy to enjoy comfort amp x200b the bitter taste of the chicory makes me grimace as it does every morning sitting at the table i enjoy the first rays of sunshine that fall on my weather beaten face our house comes alive with noises on the upper floors i hear laughter and kids running around my two sons descend from the stairs the oldest checks the status of our solar panels on one of our computers my youngest son looks at another screen to check the status of our farmbots amp x200b musing about how things used to be i look at my sons when i see them my heart fills up with pride but also with compassion they ll never know the comfortable life that i led up to my 36 years yes the world is climate neutral now but we paid a price for it amp x200b the big change started in 2019 with two unfortunate events that happened together the brexit and the impeachment of donald trump but the first seeds of the destruction of our society had been sown a lot earlier in 2009 amp x200b brexit happened on 29 march 2019 and gave cause for great political tensions within the uk the classical parties where torn apart or became irrelevant after a series of chaotic elections and re elections the extreme right wing party norsefire came to power the country went into a dark and deep recession but this gave norsefire only more power and control over the citizen s daily life amp x200b in october 2019 came the other scandal donald trump the president of the united states had already been executing for 3 years secret orders from his russian counterpart vladimir putin apparently putin had been blackmailing him with a golden shower movie in which trump played a not very presidential role the impeachment procedure was concluded in less than 24 hours after the start of the scandal the next day came the well known effect a wall street crash of epic proportions amp x200b the fall of the dow jones also made the stock markets in europe london and japan tremble and shake in london the bank barclays went bankrupt millions of uk citizens suddenly couldn t reach the pounds on their savings accounts anymore however complicated the explanation given by economists was the simple fact remained the money was gone of course bloody riots ensued politicians were slaughtered in horrible ways a bitter comical news item i remember from those times is the story of david cameron asking political asylum in cuba where he was on vacation the demand was denied and he was deported to the uk amp x200b in the midst of these turbulent times a monster reared its head from the darkest depths of the internet bitcoin amp x200b in their fearful search for certainty the british converted their remaining pounds in bitcoin soon their entire society ran on a black circuit of bitcoin the british pound wasn t worth a penny anymore the value of bitcoin however rose to unseen heights and that did not pass unnoticed in the rest of the world amp x200b to save the paralyzed economies of europe and the united states the policy makers only saw one cure inject massive amounts of money in the economy however this only drove the value of the dollar and euro downwards and the good savers finally followed the panic investors into the ever growing mighty tentacles of bitcoin the network had by then been declared illegal but this had no effect amp x200b life in a society with a deflating currency is strange if you look at it with eyes of 2019 first of all you will try to avoid spending money as much as possible why buy a coffee today if you can buy two tomorrow this reasoning caused a global shrinkage of the economy investments where postponed vital items such as fruit vegetables bread medicines rose in price superfluous items remain unsold factories producing those closed hundreds of millions of people lost their job and for the first time in centuries the amount of co2 in the atmosphere diminished amp x200b a second effect of this unregulated currency is that nobody payed taxes anymore the government became poor amp x200b this made our society evolve to an ultra liberal society the right of strongest richest or luckiest ruled national and international laws where of no significance anymore citizens organized themselves via the internet and local groups took over the tasks of the failing government carrying arms is now taken for granted justice is no longer done in a court of law but in online forums where the majority votes for the verdict and the punishment amp x200b together with the failure of the government came the failure of the energy grid people switched over to local production and storage of energy first with diesel generators but soon with solar panels and batteries even though the price of oil was extremely low because of the global recession still people preferred to buy solar panels they pay back their value whereas the value of a gallon of diesel once it s burned is gone forever amp x200b the discussion on nuclear power which had been very actual only years before became a joke how could a failing government ever find the necessary funds to build new nuclear plants amp x200b in the meantime i have as most people retrained myself to farmer it s not a heavy job robots do most of the work but it s also no luxurious we mainly eat bread vegetables and fruit we only eat meat once a year the slaughtering of the sheep is always a festive occasion amp x200b i have accepted this existence now and can also see the pretty side of it there are no more superpowers waging war they simply do not have the money to buy bombs the gap between rich and poor is closing albeit very slowly a poor man must simply save harder and spend less than a rich man since the money is gaining in value this strategy works although it will take many generations amp x200b my son s generation was too young to see the decline of our society as something abnormal they are optimistic and strong and look for creative solutions to the problems of these times health care is extremely expensive insurances no longer exist if you re seriously ill you ve got bad luck amp x200b it s especially the millennials people who are born around the year 2000 that are unhappy in today s society they remember a youth full of opportunities and dreams that have all vanished now weekend trips to barcelona or new york are a distant dream today amp x200b i often discuss with my wife if things could have been different she thinks yes if the brexit and trump scandals hadn t happened i see things differently the seeds of the decline had been sown long before the fall of our society was inevitable amp x200b i wake up from my reveries and join my sons we re going to check our farmbots each armed with a rifle we get on our bikes i put in the headphones of an mp3 player a small luxury i permit myself a song from a long time ago the rolling stones you can t always get what you want but if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need 	1
i am looking to get some bitcoin ripple etc and am wondering what are the best ways to buy it and keep it i ve had in the past but well read on when bitcoin first came about i bought very early when the first white paper was released and even mined it but then moved put my pc s into storage as we were moving around a lot and tbh completely forgot about it to be honest even when bitcoin thing really hit i d completely forgotten about it originally i d printed out my codes on paper and printed a lot of them to make me think what are these strange things that there are so many of it didn t work that didn t save me though when moving in 2016 the wife got my papers and shredded them thinking it was rubbish anyway i won t be able to find any of that the pc s and hard drives were wiped and formatted due to corruption and we smashed them up when moving as they contained sensitive data that was before i remembered anyway easy come easy go as they say there is really no point crying for what i never had as i pointed out in the beginning i am looking to put some money into crypto probably more ripple than bitcoin as i think that has huge potential and is probably the future just my view too many people who bought bitcoin have done similar to me and too many have been lost there are only a finite supply ripple is probably better in this respect and designed to be more stable mainly because they are aiming at banking sector and money transfers i think it will take time but it will hit the 5 00 mark sooner or later the only thing with ripple is i have reservations of who is behind it due to their past involvement in other crypto adventures gone haywire but the big weakness of crypto in general as i am well aware is losing it so i am looking for the best ways to buy and to store ideally i would like to be able to use my phone iphone i am not that savvy these days as to what s what so asking for the advise of those who hopefully do know 	1

i m sorry to say that i have had a very negative experience with and would strongly urge people to steer well clear i tumbled an admittedly small amount of btc to try them out and identified a few glaring issues i am still trying to resolve this issue with support coinmixer es mailto support coinmixer es and they have been less than helpful i set mixed coins to be returned to three of my addresses with delays of 1 2 and 3 hours when nothing had come back i contacted support and was told there was some error even now the second time i have seen this their so called guarantee letter does not verify as signed at all i checked their public gpg key 0x698149872a32a8bd which i cannot find on any key server bar their site this is another red flag they have given me some rubbish excuse that they had some issue or other with their server and asked me to send the guarantee letter my operating system and wallet software used explaining that i use electrum they sent me some suspicious looking code to enter into the electrum console promising me that this would immediately fix my issue i understood it was to sign a message and let them know that the output addresses were mine unsurprisingly the code spat out an error suggesting unhelpfully that i contact support i think they have a cheek to expect me to cryptographically sign my emails to support when their own guarantee letters are completely worthless the output of gpg2 verify guarantee letter txt sent back gpg don t know invalid packet ctb 0a gpg no signature found gpg the signature could not be verified i then attempted gpg2 list packets guarantee letter txt and got off 0 ctb ff tag 63 hlen 2 plen 19 new ctb packet 63 length 19 gpg control packet off 21 ctb cb tag 11 hlen 2 plen 0 partial new ctb literal data packet mode t 74 created 0 name raw data unknown length i have now sent them back an email which i have signed with all three output addresses to date i ve received no response i ve sent a transaction txid 60657f2f08813f9e5708e68e3c79dd56e29c0bf5b07f94bd5e0b9c320bc21a6e now with the op return stay away from coinmixer es and will continue to send similar transactions to the btc blockchain until they resolve this for me in all a wholly unacceptable and unsatisfactory experience save yourselves a lot of trouble and stay away from these 	0

just some food for thought btc went to 1 and then crashed down to 13 cents another time it went to 100 and crashed down to 15 another time it went to 1k and came back down to slightly less than 200 another time it went to 20k and fell to 3k each time of the crash it s still a much higher low bull and bear markets are normal cycles this is one of the longest bear markets we ve seen there will be another bull market it s what the market does while everyone is shouting out 1500 btc i m extremely confident we will never see those prices ever again in fact i think in the next 3 4 years we touch 100k and then crash down to 20k and then the next panic cycle begins relax remember this is new technology it needs time for adoption a lot of time tech always does give it another 10 years and if by then we re still at 4k ish i d be a bit more concerned i think time is running out for people to accumulate for those who were here from 1k all the way to 20k do you remember just how many people were begging for these prices god if it was just 1k or even 5k again i d back up the truck and now it s here and people are worried and afraid to touch it these are the times you buy not when it s peaking but when it s bottoming disclosure this is not to be taken as financial advise i am not a financial advisor these are just my personal opinions that i wanted to share with the community i m seeing a lot of toxicity here as of late so i felt this was warranted now commence the downvotes 	1

hello reddit we released an all you need to know guide on bitcoin etf s we would love any feedback here is a small excerpt from the article gt how do bitcoin etfs work gt now that we understand how normal etfs work we can turn our attention to bitcoin etfs gt gt 1 etfs that physically hold bitcoin gt this type of etf is almost identical compared to the etf model we ve described gt gt the only difference is that aps have the option of sending over baskets of cash instead of bitcoin this is simply for convenience as many aps don t want to purchase bitcoin and hold on to it themselves gt gt so when the ap sends over a basket of cash the etf provider trades the cash for bitcoin then the provider returns etf shares that are of equal value less transaction fees to the ap we would really appreciate it if you check it out here 	1
i have written to numerous forums with literally no responses and it is impossible to reach someone at electrum so i admit to being a bit frustrated at this point i am new to bitcoin wallets but have been on ubuntu for years downloading and installing from terminal was relatively uneventful and i was able to get a verified signature everything seemed fine on setup after depositing funds at a bitcoin atm the transaction was confirmed at blockchain com and i double checked the address no one has taken it but my wallet just won t connect to any server i have tried manually connecting to a server disabling the auto connect feature the best i have gotten is synchronizing otherwise not connected i have tried entering server addresses specifically to no avail i have even tried resetting my router in case there was a problem at that level nothing works i got the download from the official website it was the latest version 3 3 4 and it was two days ago again i got a verified signature i have been reading like crazy everything from electrum bitcointalk org and going over everything i ve done to make sure i didn t have a misstep others have had similar issues but they appeared to respond to troubleshooting i am at a loss what else can i do from what i read creating a new wallet would screw everything up or at the very least be a huge nuisance and since i really don t know how this works is the money i deposited at the atm lost since i can t get the bitcoin into my wallet i deposited it yesterday afternoon probably a dumb question 	1

it s clear to me that the only way for us to be able to take control back from the market manipulators pushing down the price of bitcoin is for us to all move our bitcoin off these exchanges into addresses that we have a private keys for go ahead and take a look at it for yourself go on over to coinbase pro and look at the btc usd market in real time you will see that there are people bots just waiting to bring in huge sells with a hundred plus bitcoin at the ask price only to delete it instantaneously and then push it down even further to the next lower price when there s not enough purchasing power at the buy side i believe that until everyone with any amount of bitcoin moves their bitcoins from all the major exchanges to their own addresses that the price will continue to be manipulated in any way that these manipulators want it to via typical wall street financialization techniques big money is all over this market right now and they are trying to get enough bitcoin to be able to control the market indefinitely they re using ingenious techniques of market manipulation with over the counter markets and cash settled futures to heavily manipulate the price of bitcoin this system has never been present in any of the previous bull or bear markets that bitcoin has experienced and we are therefore going to have to make it our mission to spread the word about the importance of taking physical custody of bitcoin asap and avoiding custodial solutions as much as possible otherwise they will continue to manipulate the price as they see fit to achieve their goals 	2

it s been two years since we last saw that gleaming 20 000 and many are asking does bitcoin show any sign that it will regain the same if not higher value anytime soon ever since it peaked bitcoin has experienced a high volatility rate with some even describing it like a rollercoaster ride for a certain period 2018 can attest to that however this year good things may be lying ahead as perceived by many high profile cryptocurrency experts john mcafee proprietor of the world famous anti virus software and bitcoin connoisseur believes that bitcoin has nowhere to go but up even predicting that bitcoin s value will breach 500 000 by the end of 2020 following his prediction model that left accurate results in 2017 he also claims bitcoin has accelerated much faster than his model assumptions thus leading him to consider another view where bitcoin may hit 1 million by the end of 2020 moreover llew claasen executive director of bitcoin foundation has asserted that it is likely that bitcoin will reach the 40 000 mark this year saying that cryptocurrency will be as risky as it is exciting ths 2019 	1

hello all i m currently running bitcoin core and also trying out lnd on windows 10 i ve run public nodes for a long time but now i want to learn more about tor integration amp x200b i read this thread is this line really accurate you must start tor browser bundle before opening the wallet for it to work i currently have the tor browser installed but it seems bothersome that i have to keep the browser open for the other programs to work do i really need to amp x200b i also read this page in the lnd github listening for inbound connections listening for inbound connections amp x200b i m pretty sure what i want to do is to run a v3 tor hidden service they say here if you want to run v3 onion services make sure that you run at least version 0 3 3 6 currently i have tor browser bundle v8 0 6 but i cannot find any information about which version of tor i have maybe someone can clarify the differences between the tor browser bundle and tor itself i seem to have trouble fully understanding it amp x200b i want to be able to accept incoming connections both through bitcoin core and lnd to support the networks if all i ve read is correct that shouldn t be a problem as long as i set everything up correctly do i still need to forward ports through my router or will the tor hidden services take care of that in some other way amp x200b i think i have found everything i need to put in the config files for bitcoin core and lnd but i don t know how i can configure tor itself if i even need to most guides are for linux and they mention a tor config file where does this exist on windows amp x200b i appreciate any answers explanations or links to guides i m sure some of you are running your bitcoin apps through tor on windows 	1

in this tweet lundeberg says that static addresses fix the problem of needed to always keep a copy of the latest channel state lest you run the risk of your funds being lost the coindesk source says gt static address for to remote outputs aimed at improving disaster recovery scenarios on the lightning network padiou explains that static addresses ensure easy fund recovery for users this feature the static information address means that with only the seed to your lightning wallet you would be able to recover the main balance in your channel said padiou the seed being a mnemonic recovery phrase attached to all lightning and bitcoin wallets users currently require both this information and channel specific information to recover lost funds could someone explain like i m a 40 year old with a phd in computer engineering and more than a decade of experience with distributed systems how these static addresses work how is it that you no longer have to keep a copy of channel state what are the limitations of these static addresses or is coindesk full of shit and this tweet still applicable p s i chose to ask on reddit first since this forum is more accessible if this doesn t work i can always go to the lightning dev mailing list but i d rather have more technical details be more readily accessible to the masses 	1

so dr doom is not stupid after all he might just be uneducated i also found the same to be true with most otherwise educated people i discussed bitcoin with they are not stupid by any means but they just fail to see the value proposal of bitcoin which requires basic understanding across many disciplines such as economy computing cryptography banking and more while consistently complaining about rising prices most of them were even unaware of the mechanisms behind inflation 	0
okay so i ll start but saying that i believe that the reason bitcoin is not consistently going back up even though transaction volume remain similar is that manipulation has over run the market to many bots not enough actual people those same manipulators seem to have more cash than the average joe i say this because the transaction volume meeting the 18k bitcoin mark or higher with less reputation built up than currently people didn t know so their was large money from bulls now the bears have more money than those same bulls because increased adoption so the question is is the price down because of a few people with alot of money we know full countries and billionaires are playing this game here maybe someone like bill gates or rothschild just sitting here accumulating doing dirty deeds on the block chain so to speak even being technically conspiracy it may be possible we all know the rothschild s got hands in banks globally and accused of many dirty deeds obviously this is speculation and theirs little if any way to prove it and i m concerned that if someone did they ll disappear like many others waits on helicopter 	2

leaving the bears and bull out of the equation it is irrefutable that the crypto bubble is already too big to ignore the crypto market is currently worth more than half a trillion dollars which equates to 10 of the 5 trillion that is in circulation across the globe the unprecedented exuberance of cryptocurrencies has established them as a viable way of fundraising for start up companies besides establishing themselves as an effective fundraising tool cryptocurrencies also gave birth to a variety of scams as there were little or no regulations involved the absence of any explicit legal framework around cryptocurrencies will only create chaos which is why it is imperative to have certain regulations in place to make the token creators accountable to an authority gt visit coindcx blockchain spring according to a report published by dappros a london based blockchain consulting firm india succeeds us with over 19 627 blockchain developers while the us has nearly 44 979 developers as of october 2018 gt this essentially means that india can easily get an edge over other countries when it comes to captivating from applications based on blockchain technology although the blockchain spring can be attributed to the growth of cryptocurrencies the technology has the ability to revamp many fields such as vr real estate database management along with many others emerging economies like india can capitalize and see tremendous benefits from the application of blockchain technology in diverse verticals such as healthcare agriculture vr real estate database management along with many others the indian take on cryptocurrencies although the indian government has an approving view for the blockchain technology the regulatory bodies have been contemplating on ways of dealing with the potential aml cft and consumer protection issues related to cryptocurrencies india s cautious approach towards certain elements of the blockchain such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets has not only hindered the crypto spring in the country but also has driven global vcs and institutional investors out of the country limiting the exposure to the regulatory risk involved with cryptocurrencies in india this prudent approach has made it difficult for crypto related institutions in india to operate global investments in the blockchain ecosystem have been considerably low in india due to the uncertainty revolving around crypto regulations in the country gt while the legalization of cryptocurrencies in india could be a game changer for the crypto industry globally adoption wise indian regulatory bodies have been hawkish on cryptocurrencies lately despite the uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrencies the indian government has set up a committee to look into prospects and consequences of legalization to sum it up although there is no official statement or declaration by the government of india on legalizing cryptocurrencies yet the authoritative bodies have made it clear that the government is heading towards devising legislation that will potentially provide better cryptocurrency protections for the common man 	1

looking back through history we can see how the hardness of a society s chosen currency was a good indicator of its technological prowess the roman empire had its currency the solidus a coin which remained largely unchanged for over 800 years with its supply tightly controlled and protected by the roman empire enabling it to maintain one of the most stable and longest running systems of society humanity had seen only when it s government chose to begin clipping the solidus where they would cut a few slices from coins in circulation then reforge those offcuts into more units of solidus while still telling everyone they were worth the same amount within 80 years of doing this roman society fragmented and dissolved ultimately breaking apart into numerous new territories ending the roman empire is it coincidence that the manipulation of the currency happened so close to the empires demise or did playing around with your society s nervous system cause it to arrest at the dawn of the 19th century we saw the evolution of currency into a very scalable printed note beginning with a limitation linked to a hard asset gold in this case which over decades was ultimately abandoned as the method by which your currency supply would be controlled over the course of this gradual disconnection we saw the emergence of currency that could be created at the will of whoever was controlling it the controllers of this new currency our governments granted themselves permission to print currency and actively devalue the moneys value in the pursuit of that nations chosen interest this led to currency that could be weaponized used to have access to all of your citizens wealth and being able to direct that kind of power is very powerful indeed this new seat of power will inevitably draw corrupt interests towards it interests not distinctly against the native population but ones who will disregard everyone in their pursuit of power printing currency and its value enabled government institutions to choose who would benefit from this newly created currency usually making whatever they were funding loom like a benefit for society but the reality would also contain corrupted influence proportional to its value with this mass currency creation vast economic action was enabled by constantly being able to steal the value of currency from your citizens and direct it towards any task that could benefit the country while helping out your close beneficiaries this led to creation of cities larger than any other before them rapidly expanded typically at the expense of their citizens as can be seen with the conditions some of the world s population who live within them seeing these two examples what kind of society can bitcoin enable could we the see the rapid emergence of a new province governed by truly democratic money could we see the emergence of the worlds first billion person city wild speculation fun to speculate though 	1

so i m new to all this but i recently bought a bitcoin on cash app and i spent around 20 when i came to the confirm screen it said that the exchange rate was 4 032 so i bought it and after the transaction it told me that my bitcoin was worth 19 75 and so i was surprise being they don t take a cut when you buy or sell and i didn t think it would drop that fast because now the exchange rate is at 3 934 however if i go to buy another one just to see the exchange rate again it turns out it says 4 032 on the buy screen but 3 934 on the sell screen does this have anything to do with timing of the exchange rate or when they take their exchange rate for the day or something 	1
 blockchain is a lie just another world run by the rich amp x200b amp x200b image bitcoin billionaires the winklevoss twins amp x200b follow the money amp x200b more than just an alternative business model blockchain represents ideology a system in which the individual is no longer at the mercy of dominant institutions that control the flow of power money and data if blockchain deteriorates into another world run by those who control the majority of the assets it s intent has been neglected and it has no reason to exist amp x200b within chains managed by proof of work and delegated proof of stake consensus algorithms this is the reality users tout decentralization rights of the individual abandoning banks and more but then fall into a system promoting the very same values they are rebelling against amp x200b pow and dpos are plutocracies in disguise the former is at the mercy of firms that can afford the most hashing power and the latter suppressed by those with the most currency amp x200b whoever can afford to mine the most controls the flow in pow systems there s no room for the individual with a starter setup having a say either invest a years salary or get lost in the dpos system the irony is even more baffling the people with the most currency ultimately get to write history amp x200b is this still the blockchain world we want trading one system controlled by a ruling minority for another shouldn t be in the discourse amp x200b steadying blockchains ideological path amp x200b blockchains growth will remain stunted unless the focus is shifted away from proof of work and delegated proof of stake based consensus algorithms amp x200b the november bch hashing wars that produced two new chains via hard fork bchabc and bsv left many speculating over governing issues within the pow world differences in principles have made this side of the blockchain vulnerable anyone with a large enough following is able to hold everyone else hostage chain sustainability isn t guaranteed due to the ease in which conflicting parties can force a hard fork amp x200b those that preach dpos put our future into the hands of 21 supernodes corruption practically hard coded into the eos genesis block everyone yearns for profit and power making the have nots pawns in the game controlled by those at the top amp x200b amp x200b a blunt account of blockchain management amp x200b blockchain governance is defined as follows amp x200b the ways in which collective action can be achieved by public communities and key stakeholders particularly those regarding the revision of past agreements amp x200b in view of the lack of a decentralized and de identified digital platform supporting the one person one vote system the governance of the chain is often seen as a plutocracy currency and computing power are king amp x200b according to an article written by vitalik buterin blockchain governance systems must be innately anti plutocratic amp x200b not only is on chain coin based governance inconsistent with user interests it is also antithetical to the ethos of public blockchains the blockchain is for the public to serve the public interest it isn t for cryptocurrency whales to get more rich cryptocurrency holdings like wealth in global society is highly concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people the blockchain isn t supposed to be owned by anyone nevermind by a small group of super rich individuals buterin amp x200b the interests of those who hold the wealth and those who actually use the blockchain are inherently different amp x200b in theory blockchain could provide an equal playing field where the world isn t controlled by large institutions only acting for profit and belittling the rights of individuals when power becomes concentrated by those holding the most currency or with the most hashing power users who continue to praise these systems are working against their own interests amp x200b the culture of blockchain implies egalitarian management anything else must be abandoned amp x200b amp x200b either we want it or we don t amp x200b the current state of blockchain is a farce either we want a new system where power is decentralized or we don t pushing the ethics of the centralized systems that have shaped our world for the worse within the blockchain space only perpetuates the virus that is elitism sucking world of its resources and milking the chain for every satoshi it s got amp x200b the increased amount of icos in 2017 gave hope surely the competition would have promoted further developments someone would have realised the bad traits trickling into blockchain but only disappointment followed amp x200b what should have been the start of a blockchain renaissance turned into a money grabbing free for all with scams poorly designed products and reckless teams becoming the norm amp x200b but we do want it we really do we want the system as it was intended to be quick decentralized egalitarian a platform on which to build the next era of society amp x200b this stepping stone comes in the form of bitconch backed by turing and nobel laureates offering 120 000tps anti plutocratic governance and an ecosystem based on egalitarian values bitconch has the speed security and morals needed warm the crypto winter amp x200b bitconch solves the issue of governance amp x200b the proof of reputation por consensus algorithm developed by bitconch creates a quantified reputation value bit r based on three dimensions social behavior currency holding time and community contribution users with reputations within the top 5 then have an opportunity to take part in the consensus this system more accurately mirrors the natural world individuals who are more trustworthy contribute to their communities and build relationships with those around them are incentivised to continue doing so amp x200b money and the size of resources are no longer a consideration which dissolves the power that the elite have over governing the chain and eliminates the possibility of bribery instead there is room for devoted lower and middle class users to take part in the consensus making the chain maintained by the people and for the people the conflicting interests of currency holders and chain users therefore does not arise amp x200b reputation makes for a conscientious ecosystem and reduced conflicts of interest supports ecosystem sustainability amp x200b amp x200b bitconch solves the speed bottleneck amp x200b if the speed of the platform is not scaled to the needs of the users usage will ultimately fall flat a blockchain is meant to be used and chains with slow speeds are simply not practical amp x200b blaze bitconch ledger access zero delay extension allows for the simultaneous verification of multiple blocks through factoring the operation into five unique yet concurrent phases fetching data decoding hashing stating the change and finally writing data when blaze is coupled with por the bitconch platform offers 120 000tps making it a platform able to support extensive amounts of traffic amp x200b amp x200b however the current focus of the blockchain world should not be on pushing tps speeds as high as possible developers and users alike have lost their way once again falling victim to the very plutocracy that catalyzed the emergence of blockchain amp x200b the ideology producing these platforms urges for the rights of the individual over the concentration of power in a few it doesn t matter if the flow of money is controlled by a few institutions in the current global economy or by a few mining firms in the blockchain world once power is taken from the individual we must dissolve the system 	1

using a throwaway account for obvious reasons i ve known about bitcoin since early 2014 right after the time when btc crossed the historic 1000 mark i learned about bitcoin the same way a lot of curious folks did back in the day silk road i learned through silk road that bitcoin was a global uncensorable currency but didn t understand the intricacies of how and why satoshi made it that way i bought about 1 btc through localbitcoin via cash and spent it all on good stuff at silk road i bought and spent almost 10 btc over the next two or three years that s when i read the bitcoin whitepaper for the first time and it dawned on me the genius of satoshi why proof of work matters why there will only be 21m btc how utxo works etc but by that time it was too late the bull run had already started and i had 0 btc in my wallet i was upset with myself for a long time for spending all that btc over the years but that s when i started saving to some day own 1 btc for when the recession hits later this year today was the day i bought 1 btc for around 3900 and i couldn t be happier i just wanted to share my happiness with someone so here i am i ll see you guys again later this year when the world is burning and we ll have out btc to hold on to 	1

 in mid november bitcoin cash bch underwent a hard fork resulting in two chains on november 20th we announced the abc chain would retain the designation of bitcoin cash bch on coinbase the competing chain known as bitcoin sv resulted in a forked coin now commonly referred to as bsv when the hard fork occurred the bsv blockchain used the amount of bch associated with an address at the time of the fork to determine the amount of bsv that would be allocated to the parallel address on the bsv blockchain as such the amount of bsv now available in your coinbase com account is the same as the amount of bch that was in your coinbase coinbase com and coinbase pro account at the time of the hard fork coinbase does not support purchases or sales of bsv so you cannot sell your bsv for fiat currency on coinbase you may send your bsv balance to an external wallet following instructions here 	1

 hello friends i am looking for people interested in participating in a challenge which is rewarded with bitcoins if you do not know what one of these challenges is they are usually images that have different messages hidden or things which if you manage to solve you can recover a btc wallet which you can keep i am not the creator the creator is an early adopter of bitcoin and i want to form a team to solve it the reward would be divided equally the people that i look for should not have a knowledge of something special than bitcoin if they know about cryptography and programming in some better scripting language but the main thing is to be perseverant honest and creative if someone is interested in forming a team with me you can talk to me thank you no i m not a scammer nor do i intend to steal private keys i only look for people interested in participating in a btcs challenge something like 3301 cicada and that style please do not comment saying that i just want to steal 	2
bottom line is i get really nice rewards on a new card i just got so instead of normally buying btc i want to buy with this card the issue is they allow absolutely no cash advances cash back nor use on sites like coinbase or coinmomma exchanges i ve tried and failed with or will not use is bitit and changelly simplex i m usa btw i d love to figure away to do some sort of exchange that lists bitcoin as a virtual item rather than a financial service however i m not sure if it s legal for a us company to do so therefore if there s a foreign exchange that would accept me i d appreciate that or some way to physically buy bitcoins with the card which i can t think of any possible way this could happen more looking for suggestions not advice as to the merits of buy bitcoin as i already regularly buy as well and i can eat pretty hefty fees as i resell at a premium thanks 	2

i often wonder how many people like myself it will take out of the 7 7 billions humans to finally break bitcoin free from the tentacles of the legacy financial institutions who currently manipulate the fiat value of our currency via the bank backed exchanges cash settled futures markets and otc markets when i say people me what i really mean is people who dollar cost average bitcoin every month regardless of the price and then immediately transfer it to addresses that they control removing any potential for custodial shenanigans out of the equation asap finanacialization paper bitcoin etc just how many people like me do you think it will take considering that there are only 17 5 million bitcoins that have ever been created and the fact that basic economic theory dictates supply and demand determines value how much longer do you think it will be until critical mass is reached by the dollar cost averaging hodlers who are hodling their own private keys i would venture to say it will be sooner than most think amp x200b remember folks the whole point of btc is for us to have a decentralized immutable censorship resistant currency of the people beyond anyone s control in order for us to maintain these properties it is essential that people download and run their own full node to be able to self validate their transactions without relying on any company or government s server help strengthen the decentralization properties of bitcoin by running your own node and contribute to one of the most important evolutionary steps humanity has made 	2
i ve said that since tether launched amp x200b it is illegal to produce digital equivalent of dollar amp x200b even if that digital dollar is backed up by 1 dollar bill paper but in tether s case that digital token is not even backed by paper dollars amp x200b basically every time you create a digital dollar token and sell it for a paper money is equal to counterfeiting money amp x200b in order to be legal you must destroy paper dollar bills every time you sell digital one you cannot have both dollars in market circulation amp x200b to be put in context is exactly like i print money at my printer and sell it on market amp x200b that my friends is illegal no matter if that counterfeiting is digital or physical amp x200b hope you realize where you put your money i have no doubts that will be ended badly for most of these coins amp x200b hold your bitcoins in your wallets wisely or you gonna regret in the future 	2

after a thought and some heavy duck duck going it is clear that every money used in civilizations of people was created almost always as debt and that in the creation the smallest unit of measure of that money was valuable whether a pence a cent or a satoshi oh wait break for shower thought in the garage bitcoin is the first form of money who s smallest unit of measure to this day can not be measured in pence or pennies only by the value given by those who hodl it the symbol for 1 satoshi is freedom end smoke break in the garage 	1
i have come full circle since my involvement in bitcoin in 2012 i believed that evangelizing and spreading the word about the technology was key i ve changed so much since those heady early days it s nostalgic in a way like looking back at a much younger immature version of myself just a few years in the past and that circle back had lead me from being a rabid supporter of everything positive in the community to a fierce critic and advocate of alternative viewpoints every member of this community who is wrapped up in the price of bitcoin in getting rich overnight you won t should instead try to use their knowledge and skills to constructively criticize and provide feedback to every development in this space people need to learn that a technology like bitcoin thrives on adversity i have come to observe through all the fork arguments the back and forth the challenges the demeaning comments the insidious players in the space all of it has only shown that wrestling with bitcoin gives it practice in anti fragility every junky clanky ui decision every busted lightning node and wallet every questionable decision by devs all should be analyzed and busted apart with every ounce of constructivity that we can muster challenge viewpoints and provide critiques remove yourself from blithely pumping prices in public wrench yourself from the human tendency to detach yourself from reason when you are financially and thus emotionally involved in something that should have no part in capricious emotional appeals if bitcoin truly is anti fragile as we often say then break it make it live where it was born the cauldron of fire that is the warzone of internet security make it thrive there and maybe just maybe one day you will realize that dream that you had of being a part of an immensely successful cryptocurrency but not before by going on easy on bitcoin we actually make it weaker destroy it if you think you have what it takes 	1

with the rise in digital trends all across the globe we have seen a huge growth in the digital finance market spanning across all sectors be it electronic payment mediums or digital transaction platforms electronic finance has never been so easier and convenient however the boom of cryptocurrencies managed to change the face of the entire digital monetary platform although digital assets could be bought and sold previously in terms of website credits or precious metals the rise of an entirely different concept of digital currency shook the foundations of every stock market in the world people all over the world are trying to tap into this immensely successful and sought after digital currency and you too can cash in on the huge profits it has to offer read on to find out more the first cryptocurrency ever to be used was bitcoin which was heard of back in 2008 when it emerged as a virtual asset with a monetary value linked to it the currency gets produced as a result of mining done by software engineers who try to crack cryptographic codes this exchange medium soon became popular due to security as a medium of transaction it uses a locked public key as a security system which essentially means that only the owner of the key would be able to send cryptographic transactions thus it defined the way for secure financial transactions which would prove impossible to hack due to additional security by cryptography global transactions can be carried out worldwide to anyone having a bank account and an internet connection the process is completed in a matter of minutes and the person at the other end receives it instantly it does not matter whether you are sending coins to your neighbor or your agent across the world the process gets completed instantly anonymity plays a lead role here the identities of the people sending and receiving the currency would also remain anonymous accounts of crypto coin holders are not registered to a real world account and thus people can carry out transactions without any inhibitions transactions can be made without need of any third party authorization as we see most commonly on the gateway page of our banks the owner of the currency would have sole access to his software which would enable him to carry out the exchange all these factors lead to a rise in the number of people carrying out trading via cryptocurrency and the stock market saw a huge growth in digital currency sectors people were keen on investing in this future currency and investment gurus wasted no time in future predicaments of digital currency boom the information in these currencies are stored in formation nodes called blockchains this ensures that the information can never be deleted or manipulated via a third party this type of blockchain information networking led to the rise of different types of cryptocurrencies some of the popular coins in today s market are btc bitcoin fees bnb binance bcn mkr ae ppt moac etc to name a few all these are mined by different investors and which then source to the public online today customers have a wide range of options from where to buy their first digital coin a lot of

today i was reading the bitcoin whitepaper not the first time made some notes on concepts like it s p2p network and privacy model also i noticed that most concepts were derived from previous works hashcash and time stamp server were heavily drawn from the references pls correct me if i am wrong but the most peculiar insight was the fact that bitcoin was not mentioned throughout the body any opinions as to why so 	1
since the price for btc is going back up i m seeing a lot of posts of the nature of i forgot my password or i forgot my mnemonic or i have 2fa but no longer have that phone if you are investing in cryptocurrency you should always assume that losing passwords 2fa auth or mnemonics will result in the complete loss of funds exchanges may be kinder than offline wallets in this regard but please never assume that there is some boffin somewhere that will magically be able to guess your secrets and return your funds to you remember totp 2fa gives you a secret code that can be used to recover your totp 2fa on another device i d probably avoid sms based 2fa since you would have no way to move your funds if you were vacationing overseas on a foreign cell network when things go lunar at a minimum get a password manager to store it all and make the password something like your ssn so your wife or whoever can get to your funds if you bang your head surfing if you correctly think your ssn is not a good password then create a cryptographically random password then store it with a steel punch on sheet metal encase it in lacquer and bury it beneath the oak tree that you proposed to your wife under point is make sure that every lock you make can be unmade by your next of kin in the case of the zombie apocalypse if you don t have a good recovery plan in place it s ultimately your fault 	1

i come from a south east asian country so most of you can imagine what the technology in there is was like to share you few actual stories 1 we were the only house back around 13 15 years ago in our entire village who had a landline phone there used to be people who used to come to my house give me the number they want to dial and request me to connect the call the average end user couldnt dial the number back then fast forward 15 yrs almost every house now has a cell phone and their little children play online games on it i got my first cell phone when i finished my 10th school and that was a nokia 2 now imagine the level of knowledge my grandfather has he is not a european or american guy who got exposed to tech 20 30 yrs back he struggled a lot to use his first cell phone now guess what he can actually dial his number on his own btw he still cant save the contacts and needs my help he is old enough so one can get why the average end user grandpa does his stuffs on his on i can make a lists of these which i have actually seen and experienced and comparing all this stuff to bitcoin its really laughable when people say the average end user wont be able to run their nodes pointing their grandma 	1

here s the video in question i left the following response as a comment and am archiving it here for historical purposes in the event they delete the comment enjoy jihan was mining on proprietary hardware not available to the public he made a business decision to fork bitcoin to keep his machines viable he thought community would just magically follow along to his side of the chain bitcoin cash is a social engineering attack on bitcoin satoshi s vision was bitcoin cash in the sense that bitcoin is open source software and anyone at anytime can fork it for whatever reason is it a good idea to do so no you silo yourselves from consensus remember community voted with nodes hashpower and an economic majority bitcoin will survive bitcoin cash if bitcoin as a community made the decision to change proof of work algorithms or block sizes or any other property of bitcoin we d have to come into consensus and softfork an upgrade everyone updates their nodes and enough time passes for participants to prepare for said change what jihan did was very hasty and not well thought out and very much against the will of community jihan deserves his punishment an inferior version of bitcoin that can only ever be the legacy of bitcoin cash bitcoin was designed very intentionally to be difficult to upgrade community stayed within consensus rules bitcoin cash forked off and did their own thing any kind of fallout afterwards is the free market at play by the way by the same stream of logic bitcoin cash satoshi s vision is ironically satoshi s vision the rules are in code and consensus if you deviate that s on you and anyone that wants to join you there can only ever be one true bitcoin lightning is innovative it brings real time payments to bitcoin and is optional main chain still works there will be more innovations if the bitcoin cash ers truly believe on their side of the chain innovate show the world what big blocks can do hopefully you ll need them someday 	1

 this bot automates making markets on binance where other market making bots fail ie bitmex deribit other attempts i ve made in the past is by counting on the market to not be volatile where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself where on bitmex and deribit these spreads ar 0 25 of a btc some smaller markets on binance have 1 2 5 spreads and greater than average volumes you ll want to have about 20 per market pair it s looking to trade in the base asset btc bnb eth etc it will look to trade more markets if the targetspread targetvoldiv targetvolmult are higher the more total funds in a particular base asset there are the higher value the orders will have if for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of considered pairs it will continue selling that asset with the same sell logic on the quoteasset bnb market while pausing buying it i don t have enough personal funds available to run the bot but i can get a good amount of income if i share it and people use my ref link targetordersizemult exists so that people can compete using the same bot on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot constantly as you can set a of your order size to ignore when there s a bid or ask better than yours when the volume that beats your price is higher than the order size this multiplier it ll re enter the market note that you should never trust your api keys to a bot without proper code review nefarious people out there will use your balance to manipulate the price of very low liquid markets and pick up a huge amount of cheap tokens from your hard earned crypto 	1

so i was tired of paying too much for tools that loaded all of my financial information onto their servers so we built a tax prep tool that runs entirely inside the browser all of the data sourcing calculations and exporting to pdf excel happens in the browser so almost none of your information ever touches our server the tool works with 120 exchanges all cryptos trades between cryptos and correctly handles trading fees for now usd is the only fiat supported we made this for the typical person that simply wants their capital gains calculated using standard fifo rules with no annoying limits on number of trades all done at an affordable price a large screenshot of blockpath s tax prep amp x200b the tool is available here with unlimited trades transactions at a flat rate of 20 i would also like to offer a free upgrade to the first 10 people to pm me their blockpath account names in exchange i just ask that you just post here to share how it worked for you i m interested to hear what you think of it matt	0
 if you a beginner have seen my last post of bitcoin generator sites then you have the obvious question of how do i get free bitcoins and no i am not talking about bitcoin faucets that give you negligible amounts of bitcoin and make you have to get a lot of referrals do you want to know the best way to get free btc well lets get right down to it also if you are a beginner and want to store your bitcoins safely i suggest using exodus wallet because of its simplicity or going to bitaddress com and making a paper wallet 1 survey sites the good folks on r beermoney can help you find even more websites to get free btc but if you answer surveys and polls on sites like grindabuck you are eligible to get payed in btc and the payouts in this website are pretty quick another way is through getting giftcards on other sites and exchanging them for btc on local bitcoins hodl hodl and paxful some of my favorite sites to do this are pollpass and crowd tap disclamer for these sites some survey and poll providers are looking for specific candidates and demographics and so getting or qualifying for surveys can be hard and such some people will get money faster and some people not so much 2 donations this one is not so guaranteed if you have an online project you are planning and people like it consider putting your bitcoin address to net donations you can also do what a guy did near the chair of the fed and put up a sign with your bitcoin address he netted 16 000 of btc same thing happened to me but on a much smaller scale i put my address in one of my last posts and got 0 02 of btc don t know where it came from but i have a suspicion it was from someone on reddit so try putting you address in next social media posts if you are popular and if you become popular from that post then you might be getting some donations your way it is not that simple however and you may not get that many donations i ll leave my btc address if you want to donate though which is 1hrdhmgos6vuys6hhuydsvndyrjkcxm8ja now you know how to get your first dollars in btc absolutely free 	1

hey guys recently updated my computer so i m reinstalling bitcoin i had it sitting on a drive that i just kept in my computer so when i tried to open the client it made me select a folder for the blockchain i chose the folder it had been previously referencing the location changed and figured it would see the old blocks in there sync up and then download any missing blocks but it looks like it redownloaded the entire chain and i have a huge bloated folder twice the size of what it needs to be any suggestions should i clear the folder and start from scratch or is there an easier way that anyone knows thanks 	1
some people are called visionaries and geniuses because they can see certain outcomes in the future the mass can t the majority can only learn from mistakes because that s how we improve it takes frustration failure and terrible events for us to move forward toward something that is better when it comes to bitcoin there are clearly two opposing sides and i think they both are correct the bitcoin community despises the fraudulent nature of printed money while people like warren buffet who represents legacy financial infrastructures despises the way bitcoin attracts greedy ignorant and deceitful people like ver and cw bitcoin is the very core of politics you can have opposing views but the best spot is somewhere in the middle because that s where you find the truth 	1
shower thought how to socially prepare a formalisation to react upon a politically not economically motivated 51 attack that could roll back the blockchain not only a few blocks but days or weeks causing disastrous consequences if the honest miners blindly switch to the longest but evil chain a social control is needed to prevent this how could it look like what do you think will happen if such an attack happened tomorrow discussion is opened i think it is good to think about it before it happens just to be prepared the worst thing one can do is to deny the possibility that it can ever happen conversely if it is seriously taken into account and counter measures are prepared then the likelihood that it happens is minimized 	1

always wanted try to jump on bandwagon since 2015 but too lazy to search how to jump in decided to start slowly bought with 200 in august 2017 shortly after price rise i went partly in with next 2000 in september i went into bank and walked away with 16000 loan without giving any reason to borrow money my wage is like 1100 month after taxes i have changed limits on my debit card to unlimited amount transacted you dont know the fear and uncertainity when you send 14 paychecks to coinbase and after that to trezor paranoia at 120 just at first half of december 2017 everybody mentioned taxes my gf told me to take out money to have good sleep and pay down the debt at this time i had like 3 67 btc ok i took out 1 2 btc and repayed the debt and bought 1080ti with btc it was dirt cheap card at that time in terms of bitcoin i have taken out slightly less than i put in to pay 0 taxes i thought iam doing wrong thing i swear i saw realistically hyperbitcoinization and moon landing during 2018 25k 50k 1m was totally clearly visible in next few months i had mental breakdown about collapse of financial system bilions of dead people who didnt see that coming and not prepared spent one week at hospital after this i was left with 2 3 btc left it untouched for whole 2018 also stopped hypnotizing charts in the meantime i was saving fiat and last month decided i need to reach 4 btc to have calm sleep now with only mine cash right now iam again at 3 5 waiting few months to give it last push to get into 5m club at 4 025 btc i hope i will reach it before summer dont do this guys put only money you already have into bitcoin good sleep is better than fear of having debtbomb ticking at your head dont watch price daily once a week is enough dont be debtor get rid of all debts imidietly house car cc also buy physical gold iam at 200g goal is 1 kg downsize your lifestyle and learn how to make fire and shelter how to grow food get a licence for owning a gun learn basic technology like on yt primite technology be prepared that one day the venezuela scenario will come to usa and eu even if that it seems totally unlikely be prepared for everything we will se in next few years global downturn dont own any debts even its seems stupid to not take them you are then only slave be sovereign and selfsustainable be your own bank provider and educator iam throwing this account away and making new 	1

yesterday i lost all of my bitcoin because of an electrum phishing scam for over a week before they released the update every single electrum user has been vulnerable to this attack i dont know how an attack is conducted but it comes from within the electrum wallet when i tried to send a transaction a message popped up that said something along the lines of you cant send a transaction until you update to the newest version this message links you to github this was my fatal mistake do not download versions of electrum outside of their official website i downloaded this new software and tried again to send my transaction with this version immediately after sending my transaction i knew there was something wrong i didn t take long for me to discover that the developer had announced that the wallet was vulnerable to a phishing attack yet again this is far from the first time this has happened to the electrum wallet take a look at r electrum and electrum s twitter there is a clear history of vulnerabilities with almost every update a vulnerability is discovered and more people lose their money what budding developer in their right mind is ok with people constantly losing btc to phishing scams with every update in my opinion it s an irresponsible or blatantly evil one if the electrum developers felt a lick of morality or responsibility for their users btc they would find a way to make significant improvements to the security before allowing anyone to send transactions or they would find a way to force people to move their btc out of their wallets so they could shut down the app for good instead they allow these scams to happen time after time again this leads me to believe that the electrum wallet itself is a well organized scam the world of cryptocurrency is a lot like the wild west right now it would be extremely difficult to put the blame on the developer because i was the one who clicked the bad link but i do have to say that link came from within the app meaning that it should be the developers responsibility through coding and proper security to prevent these types of scams from happening there was no way of me knowing that the popup message was legitimate or not additionally i m sure theres some terms of service i don t know about that says electrum isnt responsible for lost coins this completely frees the developer of all responsibility they can literally do whatever they want they don t care about keeping our coins safe and it makes me think they re actually out to take our coins 	0

 i just posted an in depth article on medium arguing that despite the predominant narrative bitcoin maximalism is incongruent with libertarianism and that libertarians should reject it the key idea is that like the ideology of a certain strand of self identified libertarians whose most vivid representative is hans hermann hoppe bitcoin maximalism is actually a manifestation of a broadly conservative approach to society this approach conflates the means to a certain positive goal with the goal itself focusing on the defence of certain transcendent features of a given social or technological arrangement i am aware that perhaps most people in this sub won t like what i wrote there however the article is written in the spirit of critical thinking and i invite you to respond to the points i raised with arguments rather than downvoting or personal attacks note that i am not at all arguing against bitcoin as such and only against maximalism 	1

i am a really bitcoin maximalist but there is only 1 thing that i disagree and aware about developers that released bitcoin in public that is the reward programming in the core as you know and i show you in the chart by the end of 2011 8 millions of bitcoins were mined from public influencers and known figures in the industry only few people were before 2011 in this market the rest came after 8 mil bitcoins were already mined some of them lost private keys of wallets but most of those stories came also after 2011 this scares me a lot in terms of price stability and volatility in the future knowing that only few groups that holding 8 mil bitcoins especially core devs and some that readed white paper at right time 8 mil bitcoins 38 from 21 mil and almost 50 from today s supply can you imagine if bitcoin goes to let s say hypothetically 1 million btc how those who own 8 mil bitcoins will affect prices in the future they can literally drop prices to half whenever they want why they did bitcoin reward like this especially when they could guess in the future that new adopters gonna lose their wallets by not knowing what they had in wallets they could make reward equally till year 2140 that way many people will lose their private keys but will less bitcoins in them i guess we can only hope that those 8mil bitcoins are in good intentions hands just be aware of how big manipulation can be in the future at any price no matter if bitcoin goes to 10mil dollars manipulation occurs from those who hold big wallets like the ones i just explained you you can pour money in the market cap as much as you can it won t stop volatility no matter how much money you pour in those who says that if market cap will be bigger means volatility will drop they either bullshiting you or they have no clue of how bitcoin was released amp x200b 	1

 if the bitcoin price drops to a certain low that makes mining unprofitable it will lose lots of miners losing the miners make it more vulnerable to 51 attacks if at this point bitcoin is attacked it s price will drop further thereby losing it more mining power making it more susceptible to attack at this point everyone will be struggling to convert their bitcoins to something else thus further dropping the price but in fact we don t even need the price to drop for this to happen when miners stop getting a block reward this will happen it is inevitable 	1

 gt this brings up the question of what a good price for bitcoin would be when will bitcoin stabilize it should become less volatile as it becomes more widely adopted because it will be harder for local events and individual people to affect the price very much right gt not necessarily although perhaps we will see less wild daily swings i think bitcoin is unlikely to ever attain anything like a stable price if bitcoin s price were stable this would mean that it had achieved an equilibrium with the other currencies there would have to be some sweet spot at which there is exactly the right balance of bitcoins and dollars when bitcoin s price went a little bit too high people would start to sell for dollars and when it went a little bit too low people would buy more bitcoins gt to anyone who thinks this is possible i ask why would any equilibrium happen what would it possibly mean for bitcoin s price to be too high unlike just about anything else a higher price for bitcoin does not reduce its usefulness one bit one simply trades in smaller amounts of it in fact a higher price makes bitcoin more useful because a higher price indicates that more people want to buy which means that bitcoin s liquidity grows which makes it more useful as a currency gt therefore i would suggest that we should never expect an equilibrium between bitcoins and dollars or any other currencies instead bitcoin should show a pattern of hypermonetization it will become more and more valuable at a faster and faster rate priced in terms of other currencies its price chart should show an asymptotic increase that approaches infinity after a finite time bitcoin may stabilize in terms of real goods but i see no reason to think that it will stabilize in terms of other currencies once bitcoin starts killing the other currencies it will still be volatile and this will still be an indication of its success gt if my prediction is wrong and bitcoin ever stops being volatile that might be a good time to dump it source what do you think thoughts	2

hi everybody i wanted to drop by to quickly tell you about a project i ve been working on recently like a lot of you i m super stoked about the upcoming release of lightning network enabled wallets like zap amp lightning app from lightning labs i was however a little disappointed when i learnt that these projects won t be supporting older generation ios android devices i was able to spin up and host an lnd node to participate on the lightning network but managing and using it lacked the simplicity and convenience of a native mobile wallet to get around this i wanted to create a rapidly deployable web based solution that would allow me to connect to and manage my lnd node from any of my web enabled devices i wanted the app to look and feel as much like the next generation of native mobile wallets as possible while still providing plenty of control over the core node functionality i decided to package my solution as a wordpress plugin and in the hopes that it may benefit others in the community i have gone ahead and open sourced the code i ll paste a few more project details below or if you wouild like to learn more you can visit the github project page at i look forward to any thoughts amp feedback you might have amp x200b lnd for wp v0 1 1 gt lnd for wp is a wordpress plugin that allows you to manage and use your lnd node right from your wordpress administration panel it provides a fully functional wallet interface allowing you to send and recieve funds across the lightning network with ease the user interface is responsive and will adapt to fit any web enabled desktop tablet or mobile device you can search the lightning network graph manage peer connections and open amp close channels with ease the plugin has qr support enabling basic encoding amp decoding of qr codes lnd for wp also adds a number of wordpress shortcodes allowing you to embed lnd functionality directly in your website pages and posts new shortcodes will be added with future versions as needs amp use cases arise 	0
i believe a small scale version of this happened during the eoy 2017 bull run can a pool of hackers send a million tiny transactions with almost zero miner fees clogging the network driving up the fees to astronomical price so high that nobody will want to use it eg 100 miner fee to send 100 someone with resources like craig write or roger ver to make their version of bitcoin fork more appealing to the masses with much cheaper fees if i am wrong or if this is not possible please correct me thanks 	1

 quote 1 gt widely believed to be the key to helping the cryptocurrency reach a mainstream audience by pushing it to handle millions of transactions lightning still has a lot of work ahead of it first and foremost it s not exactly safe to use yet no less important is that the user experience has its kinks namely the current way of generating addresses for accepting payments is not as easy or dynamic as it could be for many use cases quote 2 gt though very importantly it s not a perfect code implementation not by far plus the usual warnings about using bitcoin s lightning network while it s still early stage definitely still apply quote 3 gt the main drawback to this method is an invoice can only be used once if a user were to accept a second payment to the address the payment could be stolen quote 4 gt a hacky start while the code works osuntokun admits it s hacky so far for sure these bugs will eventually be solved but the truth is for now ln is not yet production ready it is in beta version most of the people seem s to think otherwise they think ln is production ready ready for mainstream use not yet maybe some day there are plenty of work still to be done 	2
 gt outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the bitcoin blockchain than transactions per day since one transaction can include multiple outputs the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves large players in the bitcoin space use batching the process of including multiple outputs in a given transaction to reduce their overall transaction fees therefore looking at only transactions misses an important part of the picture and gt gt when schnorr hits there will be even more batching of the transactions 	2

throwaway for obvious reasons amp x200b i know brock pierce i ve known him for years his running over people is going to cost him now i know his plan and here it is amp x200b he is posting news articles everywhere that are false in order to get the court of public opinion on his side he wants to apply pressure from low end outlets eg ccn com which recently stated that brock owns mt gox and use that pressure as a list of sources to get published on cnn com and other more reputable sources amp x200b he then wants to be able to use these numerous news sources as evidence to cite in the upcoming court amp x200b his plan is to create a concession point by stating that all proceeds from his new ownership will go to pay back prior mt gox users however here is where the catch is amp x200b the scam 2 parts those users will be paid back in the prior value of btc not the current value of btc for example around the time it was 600 btc or so current is 3300 or so if we figure 200k bitcoins then brock will net a 540 000 000 profit amp x200b bch hard fork the 200k bitcoins hardforked into btc is worth about 24 000 000 that brock will keep himself amp x200b this means brock will profit 560 million usd amp x200b brock has stated over and over again that he will pay back users but don t be misled amp x200b also let us be clear brock never owned mt gox there was never an asset sale or a company sale there is no document proving this nothing brock says he has a letter of intent however even if he did have this that has nothing to do with selling mt gox an intent contract is not an asset sale contract amp x200b also brock has retained the services of correct the net systems this means astroturfing of reddit twitter etc are well underway be aware of the pro brock army it is fully paid and not real and is only meant to sway public opinion amp x200b the big plan the reason why brock is doing these public campaigns is because he wants a vote to be done via mt gox customers he wants to build a vote list and bring this to court he wants to state 4529 customers of mt gox are in support of me owning it and this actually is a viable strategy he is misleading users he wants people to think oh i must vote yes or i will get no money and brock promises me money as it stands now brock might win so be active amp x200b the community needs to come together to apply pressure email news outlets talk on twitter raise awareness amp x200b if and when this comes to court get involved testify that you reject that brock owns mt gox even if it costs you some that you would get reject it 	1

 ways means committee testimony on cspan this morning talked a lot about infrastructure funding today and it boils down to that there s not enough money to do what the country usa needs i got to thinking that it d be pretty cool to invest in infrastructure bonds because investing traditionally in stocks and mutual funds go mostly to financial advisors and banks as a bitcoiner i m not here to debate the politics about how the gov spends its money i just want to talk about how bitcoin could be involved i never looked into this until today but signing up to buy treasury bonds is pretty simple and a hilariously outdated website and made me consider what it would take to buy a treasury bond using bitcoin obviously the treasury department doesn t take bitcoin so how do i get the perceived fiat value of my bitcoin into treasury bonds going through an exchange seems pretty backwards as the exchanges will still take fees and paying taxes the key is to get value i want out of my bitcoin as a government backed bond p2p is the best way to get my value but how do i convince someone to buy a treasury bond for me and not run off with my bitcoins amp x200b why not a time locked transaction with somebody in this scenario i d have someone purchase or provide funds for a treasury bond today and i d send a bitcoin transaction with a time lock of the term for the security lets say 1 year for a bill the sample on the treasury website would say a 10k treasury bill may be sold at 250 interest for the year i d get the gov backed security at the end of the year and my buyer gets the bitcoin that hopefully is worth more by then this doesn t sound too exciting for a bitcoiner but we could look into longer contracts and higher bitcoin prices lets consider a security that has a longer term lets say 10 years for an amount with more attractive interest this could work if my buyer wants to wait 10 years to get his bitcoin he d get a steep discount for it if we believe where bitcoin will be but we could also create a smart contract that would allow the 10 year time lock to be reduced on certain conditions can either be programmed or just done manually such as if the market rate for the coin increased dramatically that the security would be transferred once the value of the security matches up with the bitcoin i dont know what the gap between the market price of bitcoin and a treasury bond would have to be would a 29 year 50k bond be sold for only 25k worth of bitcoin today or something it sounds like some fancy accounting math that the financial sector probably has already done does this actually do anything i m not sure but rather than tie the value of bitcoin to only the magical numbers on an exchange we could pin it down to treasury bonds too and hopefully the perceived value of the bitcoin gets used for something rather than sitting around doing nothing waiting for the price to go up it kinda gets funky when people start swapping bonds as gifts using bitcoin would the government have to intervene if bonds are transferred for bitcoin with services built on top of this it will also allow treasury bonds to be purchased by individuals that may not have the ability to purchase them directly such as those that aren t tied into the financial system due to lack of access or just those that may have trouble acquiring us securities amp x200b tl dr would one sell bitcoin at a higher market rate for a government backed security would one sell government backed securities at inflated bitcoin prices amp x200b amp x200b amp x200b 	1
i have a simple question on my mind from a long time what if central banks print all the money use that money to purchase all the available bitcoin i know literally the consequences are due to demand the price keeps going up but they can get them on otc while suppressing the price by manipulating the media and other outlets with fud articles the other side effect could be they do not want to give too much power to existing whales to become central bank like monoliths of power they could even print enough money to overcome that too wonder why that is not starting to happen 	1
i recognize that a business mostly can not afford to have the payments that it receives become ten percent or more less valuable than they are regularly anticipating for their goods or services that volatility word associated with bitcoin places a lot of fear in people businesses too so my understanding i could be missing the whole picture smh is that the current implementations starbucks bakkt being used are to accept bitcoin from customers and then sell most or all of it for fiat within a short time frame that s lame af if i had multiple successful businesses and established wealth i would use the opportunity to implement the opposite model for at least one of them i would accept dollars fiat and make clear to my patrons that it would immediately be sold for bitcoin as that is the preferred method of payment and security in futuristic global commerce the magnitude of bitcoins potential brings alarming realizations to the shitty way things are being and have been done i have so many emotions revolving around the different understanding of money i have uncovered within my thoughts do you think businesses should accept fiat and buy bitcoin or do you think they should accept bitcoin and sell it for fiat leave a comment below 	1

perpetual exponential growth of any asset would protect investors against losses and guarantee significant returns on their initial investments this would be the ideal situation for any investor according to this theory why not create a virtual coin which has no intrinsic value however it has an agreed upon increase in price controlled by a single corporation without influence of the market 30 annually for example to ensure a sufficient amount of circulation within the market you could implement a policy which does not allow owners to own a coin for longer than an agreed upon length of time 6 months for example this would ensure that there are enough virtual coins to be bought to ensure that there is enough supply the corporation could occasionally split the coins increasing the supply of the virtual coin or simply introduce a new supply of coins to meet demand demand would eventually be there because exponential growth is extremely attractive to investors amp x200b i would like to receive feadback on my theory and i made a youtube video giving more context 	2

you are probably smart enough not to open random exe files from the internet right you might even drop an exe in to virustotal com if you are doubting to see how the rest of the internet feels about that file but you probably don t think twice about opening winrar file well there is a winrar exploit now that is going to make millions of victims here is how it works you open the wrong rar file with an unpatched version of winrar and a payload is dropped in to your windows start up folder which means on reboot you will load up an exe and nobody ever updates their windows and rar files are used op usenet and also in torrents so this is going to steal a shitload of coins i can guarantee it so patch your winrar go to and download the latest version search and delete and destroy any version on your computer you can find that s under winrar 5 70 let your friends and family know if you are on any computer with an older version of winrar please replace if you downloaded and opened that leaks rar that was posted here today about a big bitfinex leak well you are infected now 	2

i ve got a couple days to kill and wanted to see the current state of the lightning network on mobile i ve got an android phone and would like to set up a lightning wallet in a completely non custodial manner that is as trustless as reasonable i will not insist on compiling software from source code i also have an ipad if that would be easier but i would prefer android as that is my mobile device i already run a btc node on my windows computer and have an eclair node set up on there as well i assume that the best way to have a functional noncustodial mobile lightning wallet is to install a wallet on my phone that can connect to my pc but i could be wrong and am open to other methods i am not interested in custodial wallets or wallets that use someone else s btc node i do not have a static ip but if it is required i can rent one from my vpn provider i have tried to search for a tutorial myself but i have not found any that provide instructions for what i am trying to achieve if you know of a good tutorial please let me know moreover if i have made a bad assumption please point them out thanks	0
i recently moved from nyc to upstate ny from an area where there were chase banks on every corner to an area where the closest chase is 1 hour away i signed up with the most popular bank up here so i could have convenient access to atms i kept my chase account because i like the convenience of their online banking so in order to funnel money from one bank to another i need to connect them through their online portals twenty minutes on the phone with their tech support several bugs including the need to click submit several times until error codes go away without even changing details in the fields an email verification that requests a code but the email includes only a verify button and literally having to refresh the page and start over in order for changes to update on the browser side all that and the accounts still failed to connect i now have to wait several days for verification deposits to reach my accounts and unlock the ability to transfer between banks anyone who says legacy banking is convenient enough has forgotten about the headaches and annoyances of setting things up in the first place these are the types of things that bitcoin will supplant when it matures 	1
i love how nobody ever thought about using the language the name satoshi comes from just use any goddamn character from the name it s in hiragana and in katakana i would simply use the katakana symbol for the syllable shi is the last character of the name the satoshi is the last fractional digit in bitcoin is the most recognizable among those is very easy to write by hand is already in unicode so you don t need to waste so many people s time by trying to push your pointless designs looks like a face satisfied and happy while looking how bitcoin price moons comes from japanese just like the name satoshi nakamoto send me 283 k 0 00283 btc wallets would just need to include the unicode character into their interfaces outside wallets people can always write it this way send me 5776 	2

so i never really thought about cryptocurrency until this happened amp x200b some guy on instagram reached out to me and wanted to see if i wanted to invest in bitcoin alongside him i was really skeptical about this because usually these guys don t reach out to you you reach out to them so i started talking with the fellow and poking around his profile and stuff he has 12 000 followers which could just very well be paid bots he also had testimony videos that seemed generic and never really mentioned his name in his profile however he does show videos of him talking about his mining rigs and setting up a new facility in syria i think i asked him for verification but he didn t give it as it was supposedly used for illegal activity he also has told me he is based in georgia country and a website linked in his bio does say they have an office in georgia amp x200b so then i asked him how would i know if he s real he replied with this for you to believe i m real i will credit your mining wallet and the money won t be spendable till the server that did the payment receives the crypto you invest automatically it will become spendable how much do you intend to invest amp x200b so eventually he sets up a blockchain wallet for me then i get 500 of bitcoin off coinbase that same day i won 500 off a scratch off ticket so if i lose that money it won t be as painful i was talking with him and later i ask him what the process is and he says this well the process it s all about mining more coins and trading for you which will generate the profit yeah no need for that again since you have bought we will mine trade and generate your roi your wallet has been linked to the mining farm for that i also keep talking with him and he says the minimum investment amount is 500 for him because it depends on the miners platform amp x200b two days pass and my skepticism is still lingering so i asked him how he wouldn t walk out with my bitcoin and blatantly scam he said this to me okay i am a man and i know where i have come from principles and discipline guides us my word is my bond i understand how you feel and trust me i did the same thing on my first investment i was so scared each palpitation in my heart was engraved with the words you might lose this but i looked around me and told myself i ll make it and today i am happy i don t do such because i have something way better than that gives me enough money to settle my needs once i ve mined and traded for you you will get paid and i will collect my little commission that s how it works both parties investor and the miner earn after the process so don t feel and think negative man it will work out amp x200b so then i send him the bitcoin and the value increased since i spoke to him eventually he mined and traded then got back to me and deposited bitcoin into my blockchain wallet and he said due to the rise of value in bitcoin my profit will be higher i was only supposed to profit about 650 but instead got 4700 eventually i authorize him to send me the coins to my wallet and i get a whopping 1 762 bitcoins but it is labeled as non spendable and it is waiting on 3 confirmations i ask him about it and he says this yeah after confirmation it won t be spendable due to the increase in price of bitcoin it affected the servers so after mining and trading for you the server credited your wallet with that high amount and for it to be spendable you will send 2000 btc to the server making it the investment of 2500 and the roi is what you just received then you will send me the miner s fee of 150 and service charge of 50 so i was confused where 2000 came from and he said this about it the 2000 won t be a new investment it will be the balance of the first one i did that for you to see it s not a scam then i talk to him about how i will have 4700 left after sending him the 2200 but he says that i cannot use it because it s non spendable and it will remain in my wallet and supposedly i need to buy another crypto and send it to that server assuming it s the 2200 he then says before it will become spendable after confirmation you will have to balance the invest amount i ask him what the process is and he says okay you will have to buy bitcoins of 2200 and send to the server to equal the investment balance and once it s received the whole money in your wallet becomes spendable amp x200b so does what this guy is saying check out and as i said the 1 7 bitcoin he sent me is pending confirmation to be spendable from what i understood on blockchain s website but it doesn t make sense to send him more money imo he also told me to get luno so i can send my bitcoin to the bank but he has access to my blockchain wallet unlike my luno account but all log ins have to be authorized by me for blockchain so if he tries to get in i can deny it he told me he would tell me when he would need to log into blockchain and guys before you call me a dumbass that s getting scammed i realize that but i figured i d ask the community because maybe it is true thanks for the help and sorry for all the reading 	1
hi i would like to share something with my bank account i was waiting for some invoice payment since december i blame the company that they did not pay me at time today i found out that my bank freeze my account because they requested me some paperwork they said that they send me letter in early february to notify me but i did not get that letter but because i did not know i blame the company so i was very pissed off with the company who had to pay me and i had to make several call to find out that they actually send the money but my bank rejected the incoming money i called my bank and they confirmed the rejected income i had to apologize to the company which is a very good client of mine it was really embarrassing and this looks very stupid from my side now my account is frozen till i have the paperwork they request with btc this wouldn t happen only wanted to share this experience and show that bank have us by the balls 	2
hot wallets have high fees have a terrible security record and the transaction times are ass i can understand why cold storage solutions exist and i am specifically talking about hot wallets like blockchain info etc ln is faster and have less fees now you might be saying that you only send very small amounts on ln but you already store small amounts on hot wallets because of advice from experts that it is insecure i don t know the security record for ln but i think the speed is worth it now you may have a different opinion and i respect it but please don t downvote this to hell because you disagree	0

this is likely a noob set of comments but here goes is a majority of the buy and sell wall movement up and down done by algos bots or is this spontaneous organic activity when the volatility drops this activity seems to jump are these bots actually the same for multiple exchanges to manipulate the global price it would seem likely in order to keep a trading range so tight for 3 5 days am i wrong here or do these bots actually seem to make more money than actual major price movements assuming you made money on the way up and down by controlling the market with your walls is it reasonable to conclude that they are actually making money no matter the market since the algo controls the upper and lower range by moving the buy and sell walls the smaller investor is just guessing and getting lucky enough to buy at a price of his choosing and sell at a price of his choosing sometimes you think it will go down further and it doesnt and therefore you miss your target the guy that is running the algo knows exactly how far up or down they are pushing so they make money for sure with each swing i have stuck in bids here and there for scalp trades but i recognize how you can end up being a bag holder here all of this seems to make trading almosg pointless for the retail investor or am i missing something if anything you could emphasize the benefits of a multiyear hodl based on the difficulty winning against the algos the more traders that jump in the tighter the range for the bot seems to get until the risk benefit for the average person becomes quite high you never know when they drop a buy wall and leave you a bag holder since you and me dont control when the bot starts stops how it selects ranges we are at a strict disadvantage bots seem to trade in about a 50 70 btc range since they cant move the global spot price any further on a local exchange some bot walls are so big it looks like they could devour a sell resistance level on the exchange but instead they use the natural sell wall that is already in place to their advantage since they know they have sellers on the high side they dont even have to put on their own sell wall and take any risk they can use existing sell wall to buy at a lower price either way based on the sheer size of some of these buy walls right now can you predict that btc will actually blow past resistance or no just eyeballing things today it seems like we could easily pop up 200 points if the algo owners decided it was time with the added cash they are amassing with the bot activitg they prob have a lot of capital that they fleeced from someone or another 	1

 so around december 2017 i put in 300 in coinbase and i did not start selling it until like 2018 jan but as of now after trading it a few times it s worth around 20 should i bother to file those loss at this point i just make fun of myself when i look into the coinbase app 300 is nothing to me less than a day of my pay but should i even bother to claim the loss i know if you win more than 600 it s required to file but since i lost around 280 is it even required to file maybe i will save myself 50 100 if i claim the loss but it costs more to file taxes when i try to claim those loss and is turbo tax better or credit karma 	1

 brokering with a gold metal company and my task was to 1 300 000 euros to swiss franc or buy that much worth of bitcoins i was looking into bitcoin at first and i was wondering if it is possible to purchase this much with the physical amount of 1 300 000 euros thank you i don t really get the dilemma but i think they believe the transfer rates are high with banking i just need a commission so i don t want to question located overseas btw i got replies but i couldn t reply because it flagged maybe trading someone mentioned laundering which what i thought at first but i thought it was just something done in europe also someone mentioned depositing but from what i got that even 200 000 was too much to deposit for i was trying to help him purchase the huracan he wanted i also discussed local bitcoins as i am now discussing with his partner i am not sure how good or is though or even it is likely someone has that much bitcoins i really don t get too much of an explanation but i was assured it was legal since i thought tax evasion looked into otc as well but that might be bank transfer as well i figure the main issue is there gold trading store accepts euros but they want swiss franc for they are in switzerland i was informed too high to switch from euros to swiss franc which is why they wanted the sales from their store to get swiss franc i am lost and just wanted to help a dude find a car but i came to here because this likely needs to be solved to get my commission 	1

 one of the most common negative things about bitcoin that comes up repeatedly in the mainstream media is the energy toll that bitcoin and ethereum mining have had on the environment and even if a large share of the energy used during mining is from an excess produced at hydro electric plant the environmental toll is still not negligible the alternative to proof of work through mining would be proof of stake however under pos what prevents investors from buying large shares of a cryptocurrency during early stages of the project or from developers controlling a majority of the currency as is seen with many projects out there today are there other options that allow cryptocurrencies to ensure decentralization right from the beginning without relying on mining and are there any projects that are have been decentralized right from inception 	0

1 recently on 2019 03 09 i came up with an idea for an app that would help bitcoin users privatize their bitcoins and untraceably send them to an address with no prior history this idea is completely decentralized and involves zero trusted third parties i think it would be much faster than other privacy solutions such as wasabi and joinmarket and it could be especially useful for helping bitcoiners recover their privacy if they ve reused an address or withdrawn money from a service that has their identity such as an exchange the only thing is i don t have the skills to do any serious coding so i m hoping someone else will take this idea and run with it i only know html css and javascript and this idea involves network communications and lightning so it s beyond my abilities front end description 2 the interface for the app would be very simple it would have two fields for user input in field one the user would enter the amount of bitcoins they want to privatize and in field two they would enter the address they want to receive their privatized bitcoins at when the user fills out both of those fields and hits enter the app would process some data see below and spit out three things an address to send their bitcoins to generated by the device and fully controllable in settings not relying on any third party service an amount to send and a qr code to scan with their bitcoin wallet 3 depending on how the app is made the amount the user needs to send would either be slightly higher than the amount the user said they want to privatize to account for onchain fees and lightning fees see below or the app might tell the user how much and how many transaction fees will be deducted from the amount they entered in field one once the user has sent the full amount to the address indicated different bitcoins would be sent to the address in field two and no one would be able to connect the user s address from field one to the user s original address nor could anyone connect the inputs to the outputs this is because the original inputs and the final outputs are part of completely separate transactions set up trustlessly offchain back end description 4 how it would work on the backend is this the app would use lightning htlcs to swap the old bitcoins for different bitcoins rapidly and it would set up the exchange trustlessly off chain the old bitcoins would go to someone else and the user would trustlessly get different bitcoins from a counterparty whom no one else can identify moreover this process eliminates the need to wait for a bunch of other participants to do multisignature transactions with you which is one of the downsides of other privacy solutions such as wasabi and joinmarket instead you only wait for three onchain transactions at least two of which would very likely get confirmed in the same block for a total wait time of only twenty minutes on average and depending on how the user sets transaction fees 5 to accomplish this privatizing feat the app would first need to create a private lightning wallet this step might sound harder than it really is wallets like bitcoin lightning wallet for android can already set up a fresh non custodial lightning wallet in a matter of seconds and since that s an open source project the code for doing so could mostly be copied 6 next the app would need to connect to a liquidity provider i e some node that promises to open a channel to your node for a fee and it would need to ask that service for an invoice to pay for liquidity of an amount equal to or higher than the amount from field one note that such services already exist such as thor from bitrefill and there is already a proposal the liquidity provider proposal to make this a standard trust minimized part of the lightning spec also liquidity providers can only offer a limited amount of liquidity so the app would have to limit the amount of bitcoins you can privatize based on the most liquidity that can be bought 7 next the app would need to make sure that in opening the channel from paragraph 6 the liquidity provider and the app would need to cooperatively create an htlc that uses the address from field two as the output in case of a channel closure since all htlcs are created cooperatively anyway this shouldn t be a problem 8 next the app would need to create a lightning invoice to receive money equivalent to the amount from field one possibly after deducting some transaction fees 9 next the app would need to calculate the following things the cost of the onchain transaction to the address from field two the cost of buying liquidity from paragraph 6 and the cost of the lightning fee for paying the invoice from paragraph 8 10 next the app would need to prepare to open a new lightning channel to any well connected node on the lightning network it wouldn t open that channel yet because the app has not received money from the user yet but it would need to prepare to open the channel and make sure that its capacity is equal to the amount from field one plus the amount from paragraph 9 unless the app is going to deduct the amount from paragraph 9 from the amount in field one in which case the total channel capacity would only need to be equal to the amount from field one 11 next the app would need to present the user with the channel address how much to fund it with and a qr code for the user to scan with their bitcoin wallet this information would appear when the users hits enter on the front end as mentioned in the front end description 12 next when the user funds the channel the app would need to wait for at least one confirmation and then spend some of the money in the channel to pay the invoice from paragraph 6 this would create a new channel from the liquidity provider to the user s device once that channel is opened the app would need to spend the rest of the money on the device to pay the invoice from paragraph 8 thus a payment would come to the user s device from the channel prepared in paragraph 6 for the amount specified in the lightning invoice from paragraph 8 equivalent to the amount in field one possibly minus some transaction fees 13 next the app would need to close its channel with the liquidity provider thus the amount from field one would be sent to the address from field two possibly minus some transaction fees the bitcoins involved would be totally different from the ones that the user originally had they would essentially come from the liquidity provider while their original bitcoins are still in the user s lightning channel and now belong to the counterparty from paragraph 10 the receiving address would be the address chosen by the user in paragraph 2 and presumably no one has ever seen that address before and if any blockchain analysts are trying to trace these funds they would be unable to trace the inputs to the outputs because they are part of completely separate onchain transactions oh yeah and since the swap was arranged offchain over lightning the whole thing happens quickly and trustlessly 14 note that this app idea involves lightning payments which can sometimes fail to find a successful route if there is a payment failure the user would need to be made aware that that money has not yet been privatized and is still on their device they d also need to be given a try again option and a cancel or withdraw option in case they don t want to try again 15 also there is at least one wait time involved in this idea because it involves three onchain transactions one is when the user first sends money to their device via an offchain transaction another is when the device opens a channel to the lightning network and a third is when the liquidity provider opens a channel to the user s device but all of these transactions could very realistically get confirmed in two back to back blocks depending on how much the user and the liquidity provider pay in onchain fees and depending on how many confirmations the counterparty from paragraph 10 requires before they ll route payments from the user s channel 16 in any case the user would need to be told what s going on while they re waiting since they ve already paid money but it hasn t yet been privatized if they get impatient while they wait they should be able to cancel the privatization possibly if one or more of their payments hasn t confirmed yet the app could give them the option to use rbf to try to recover their money note that some liquidity providers are experimenting with the idea of providing liquidity instantly without waiting for confirmations so eventually users might not need to wait on their liquidity provider 17 the issue of cost should also be considered there are several costs involved in this idea specifically it costs money to send money to the app it costs money to open a lightning channel it costs money to pay for liquidity and it costs a very small amount to pay a lightning invoice which happens twice in this idea progress bar in my opinion the app should have a progress bar that helps the user visualize how far along the process is in addition it could break down the progress in steps something like this might work nicely privatization initialized estimated wait time for full privatization 20 minutes processing user input done total progress 8 33 creating temporary lightning node done total progress 16 67 connecting to lightning network i e paragraph 6 above done total progress 25 preparing onchain transaction i e paragraph 7 above done total progress 33 33 generating invoice i e paragraph 8 above done total progress 41 67 calculating costs done total progress 50 please send amount to address qr code here note the address above was generated by your device you own the private keys you can view them in settings after arranging to exchange your bitcoins new bitcoins will be sent to your receiving address the total amount includes the following fees or the following fees will be deducted amount for onchain transaction to your address this should probably be adjustable in settings amount to purchase liquidity via lightning and exchange bitcoins through that channel cancel button here awaiting confirmation done total progress 58 33 paying for liquidity done total progress 66 67 awaiting confirmation done total progress 75 exchanging bitcoins done total progress 83 33 sending funds to your address i e broadcasting the htlc done total progress 91 67 awaiting confirmation done total progress 100 congratulations your bitcoins have been fully privatized your original bitcoins no longer belong to you and different bitcoins have been sent to you from address abc belonging to the liquidity provider no one involved in this process asked you for identifying information so no one knows to whom your address belongs this process was also trust minimized at every stage you either had private keys to the addresses containing your bitcoins or a signed transaction from someone else paying your bitcoins to you conclusion 18 i think this method of privatizing bitcoins and throwing off blockchain analysts would be much faster than using wasabi or joinmarket it leverages one of the most important features of the lightning network private transactions and leverages that to privatize onchain transactions it occurs to me that this idea could also be used to create a private send feature in bitcoin wallets all the user would need to do is type the address they want to send privatized bitcoins to into field two and the amount they want to send in field one what are your thoughts could this work 	1

hi as the saying goes there are only two sure things in life death and taxes not very sure about the latter though so i have some stash of bitcoins that i have migrated from various exchanges to my ledger nano s now though i am thinking of how to ensure that my wife and kids get my bitcoins in case i pass away with one condition though i don t want to share the private key with my wife yet i would like her to have it only in case i pass away one idea that have crossed my mind is to actually split the private key written down on a piece of paper in 3 parts and store them physically in 3 deposit boxes in different banks but this idea in the first glance seems like overdoing and unnecessarily expensive at least usd 150 200 a month on the other hand its quite some bitcoins that i would like to secure so what would you guys propose as alternative methods for ensuring that they are not lost if i am dead or disabled thank you 	2

would one sell bitcoin at inflated market rates for us treasury bonds the transaction can be made into a smart contract or even just a simple time lock which can tie the ownership of certain securities to the bitcoins for the term of the security i dont know what the math would look like to compare the market rate for a treasury bond for bitcoin but i d think the math can be done on it rather than tie bitcoin to only the magical market rate of exchanges it d be interesting to see bitcoin to be tied to something else too avoiding exchange fees would be great too if us treasury bonds are transferred to individuals or entities for bitcoin would the government have to intervene individuals can purchase these securities today would a market to buy and sell them for bitcoin be something that will eventually need to be available having bitcoin s perceived value being used for funding rather than just sitting around waiting for the price to go up seems like good idea to me 	1

a friend showed me all the questions they had to answer on coins ph exchange and it was ridiculous pages and pages of questions this really is crap i told him to use bisq or trade in person this is way too far it s as if they think their cusomters are already criminals i mean a lot of info they are asking would have previously required a court order to get amp x200b i went to search on youtube privacy vs aml kyc and found nobody speaking on behalf of privacy this world is gone folks there is no freedom or privacy or personal dignity and i m very depressed because it seems that people just are not opposing invasion of privacy and censorship and this is what it is all about they want kyc so they can eventually censor people s ability to use or spend money when we look at how many examples of speech are censored for political reasons the conclusion becomes obvious this is shaping up to tie in with china s social score black mirror so that eventually if your views are outside what the state wants you will have no access to your money amp x200b if you are into crypto and don t stand up for the right for financial privacy then the crazy christians end time prophesy will be proven correct amp x200b some articles on the subject kyc doesn t always target the bad guys it prevents impoverished people who may not have access to identification from opening bank accounts freezing them out of credit which could be life saving it can be wielded like a cudgel by the majority over minority groups and most crucially for our purposes it utterly obliterates any shred of anonymity or privacy amp x200b privacy both financial and personal is a key component of life in a free society unlike in totalitarian or authoritarian regimes individuals in free societies have a private sphere free of government involvement surveillance and control the united states constitution s bill of rights particularly the fourth fifth and ninth amendments together with structural federalism and separation of powers protections is designed to further that end by protecting individual rights the current financial regulatory framework is inconsistent with these principles amp x200b 	2

hello everyone long term bitcoin user here i m quite a neutral person i like the idea of the lightning network and have used it a lot before like most of us i ve come across very positive reviews and also harsh critiques about where ways have been going let s just assume for the sake of the argument that segwit amp lightning would not work as intended and we would need to reverse a lot of stuff or had to take another route to solve scalability in generel as is said i am very supportive of the ln and as i understand segwit it was particularly designed to enable the ln and indirectly made more space in the blocks without increasing actual blockzise much further i m not that technical and can t understand the implications perfectly for example there is critique about backwards compatibility what would we do if all those bitcoins being in the ln or stored on segwit format addresses would need to be put back on legacy format because for some reason we needed to do that would they just be lost would we fork them to a new format can segwit ln actually even be reversed what would be an alternative scaling solution obviously maybe increasing the blocksize but are there any other options besides blockzise and segwit ln like blocktime or something else i indirectly asked that already but would it actually matter if segwit ln fails couldn t we just migrate everything out slowly and test new ideas we could even still just scale further by increasing the blocksize like bch sv already tried and still most likely be the majority chain and just use that approach i mean technically segwit nl is not an absolute and it doesn t need to be this is why i don t understand the forks all those things can be achieved on 1 chain and could should be argued on one i m all for forks but i think rational thinking would still make everyone argue within the main project everyone could make their case we can have ln segwit and still scale blocks and op codes what do you think how do you think scaling will look like a few years from now what approach will be taken if lightning fails tldr see title 	1

i ve been on the bullish side of ln for over a year now but find myself unable to address certain criticisms rick falkvinge s new video in particular pulled me closer to the fence can we have an honest discussion about his points not his character which are valid invalid must be online possibly solved by a trustless contract lets call it loop to where a failed route to an offline merchant auto redirects funds to their a ln node when it comes online b on chain wallet b is certainly possible loop out but not ideal people who are least likely to be online are least able to afford moving funds from l1 to l2 often amp x200b routing unsolved with channel liquidity constantly in flux how will routing scale to hundreds of millions billions of users while preserving privacy speed and decentralization amp x200b nodes legal liability rick claims people are now admitting this but couldn t name anyone let alone anyone of importance the worst i ve heard is andreas saying it may carry some risk in already oppressive countries china north korea venezuela etc who are less than friendly towards crypto in general amp x200b reactive security eltoo solves greatly improves this iirc amp x200b cold storage the answer to this is always hot wallets for spending money and cold wallets for savings for individuals spending money may mean hundreds of dollars depending on cost time to move new money to ln that s a big enough target on its own but what about merchants dealing with many thousands of dollars loop out is a good enough solution to this but there is still risk in the interim unless they constantly loop out which won t be cheap are there any other proposals to improve ln security amp x200b not production ready yeah you can t rush innovation and btc ln are certainly doing more of that than bch bsv but is nobody else worried about the increasing expected time to completion most recently andreas a said 2 years amp x200b bonus round concerns not mentioned in rv s video receiving capacity you have to find 1000 somewhere to receive 1000 through ln or constantly splice loop out which won t be cheap it feels wrong if we get trustless ln liquidity providers to create a channel for you with x receiving capacity then great but if not many will wonder why this is better than visa amp x200b please don t take this as fud bitcoin is resilient because it faced shrugged off and adapted to a decade of attacks now is lightning s time to prove its resilience	1

not that it matters at all but for the public record as much as rbtc claims to be uncensored and free speech they simply cannot handle truth exposing the bcash corp lies you see like anyone else who has spent more than a half hour browsing the cognitive dissonance disinformation and lies on rbtc i just happened to notice that all of the threads are dominated by discussion between the same user names who seem to have the time and energy to post 24 7 you see the names over and over again i was bored waiting for my ten minutes to expire to answer an obvious non truth when i started listing the user names i saw who were spilling out the usual predictable dishonest catch phrases on a napkin i got to less than 250 user names that seem to constantly intentionally misunderstand ln intentionally deceive posters sway the narrative back to the same tired rbtc corp narratives outright lies and deception that s it that s all 250 posters in a failed project s hijacked sub now that being said only about 40 of them appear to work full time so the remaining 200 odd could possibly be just those who just believe the propaganda because they are too afraid of the truth that exists outside of rbtc those in denial after posting the list of the top 30 today i was going to post the top 40 tomorrow the top 50 and so on i received so much gold and silver it s stunning so obviously my post within a comment by the way was very well received but it also got me banned i think like most people rbitcoin is where we come for technical help news information on development etc and rbtc is where we go for a laugh and waste some time just realize now that bcash truly is a desperate sinking ship with a remaining 250 gullible corporate followers and of course n queensland y all enjoy the worthwhile content and helpful and kind community here on rbitcoin now it s hell out there in censored rbtc hashtag censored and banned at rbtc 	1

any coin implementing an escrow protocol layer not another dx not a smart contract but an embedded native escrow protocol in its blockchain will automatically become a market in itself and any coin that let its nodes get the fees from all the transactions made on its blockchain due to its escrow protocol will see its nodes proliferate by hundreds and hundreds of thousands and as other coins will do the same then you will have a true competition in speed security and safety and as this competition will weed out the week then you ll have the clean and working crypto world with only a few best left 	1

hi everyone having joined in 2016 i can call myself a long time bitcoin enthusiast i started off with bitcoin core and even though storing the ledger on my disk space was a bit of a hassle overall things went perfectly fine that is until the bitcoin cash fork in 2017 after which i gave up on the idea and switched to jaxx overall it was a significant improvement for me as i began expanding my portfolio and diving into crypto again but last year i somehow missed the bsv fork i thought it was too late to jump on that train as jaxx never supported it and i didn t bother looking elsewhere at the moment recently i stumbled upon magnum a wallet that declares it can handle any fork claiming so i decided to give a try but still emptied my bch account beforehand then imported the private key in magnum and surprisingly it worked i got my long awaited bsv and proceeded to claim a whole lot of other forks i didn t even know i could claim if you are a lazy bum like me and still haven t done this it s about time just pick a wallet you trust that can do that for you and be careful p s if you can recommend any other wallets or services with such functionality make sure to mention them in the comments as i personally believe that people should know about it 	1

hello reddit we just recently put out an information piece about different trading bots and how to start using crypto trading bots you might be wondering why use trading bots gt gt save time gt gt calculating trades and executing them by hand is time consuming and tedious work the most difficult part is coming up with a strategy once you ve done that there s no need to waste hours cranking repetitive work bots can do it for you gt gt efficient execution gt gt bots are much more efficient at placing orders than humans you may be able to place one trade at a time by hand but instantly be able to place fifty with a bot gt gt there are a lot of strategies that are simply not possible to do by hand manual calculation and execution would take too long and cause the opportunity to be missed gt gt consistent strategy gt gt it s very difficult to follow a consistent strategy by hand emotions often get the best of us and we make changes to the plan on the fly gt gt algorithmic trading takes the emotion out of trading and can consistently execute the same strategy over time you can find the article here this took many hours and i hope to hear any feedback that you might have 	1

i know i m going to get attacked here but it s been maddening right when it came out i was excited and started mining slowly before i truly understood what i was doing my wallet was tied to some barebones desktop software that was eventually abandoned and i was not properly prepared for it to end back then i wasn t using the best password wallet and it eventually stopped working too years went by and i sat on the sidelines but now in 2019 i figured it would be nice and user friendly to get a wallet safe fast and easy after all of these years instead i was confronted by a landscape of different wallet frontends to choose from none of them with an interface designed for humans or instructions that made you feel an iota of confidence and none of them one showed a clear value over the others so i just chose safest path the default bitcore and got started i dedicated an entire drive to the wallet just to be sure it started building the database but it took nearly an entire month to get 3 4 of the way to existence seemed like a ridiculous wait just to get a wallet i couldn t even get familiar with the software until the database was complete but then i ran a virus check on my mac computer which has never turned up anything and that empty drive for the bitcoin wallet from bitcore was swimming in viruses so i deleted it honestly how is a normal every day user supposed to use bitcoin when you can t even get a wallet without an advanced engineering degree and a multi month wait i love the idea of having a bitcoin wallet but it s been many years now and i feel like i still don t even know where to start is it really this hard or have i been tricked into thinking it s difficult when there really is a simple solution or is obtaining a bitcoin wallet always going to be a complicated yet delicate system that s rife with hurdles but once you get it you don t have to think about how hard it was to obtain anymore or is it this hard to intentionally shut out the normal user to keep it elite because i thought the greater the adoption rate the better okay release the hate tldr version how in hell do you even get a wallet if you re a normal human without an advanced engineering degree or months on your hands for it to build its database do any of them have a user interface that makes it clear and easy 	0

i see a lot of posts who propose symbols for the satoshi imo we should just call the satoshi the basic unit of measure bitcoin at the end of the day bitcoin as intended today does not exist it s just a lump of 100 000 000 sats so what about just retaining the brand recognition but slowly moving down the bitcoin title to the lower scales effectively makeling bitcoin be the smallest unit of measure available if it s too drastic for the time being then at least i d move the definition of bitcoin to be the millibit first then eventually keep on moving down to the satoshi as the valuation increases 	1

the fed is run by very scientifically minded economists who draw from 500 years of economic history to determine current economic and political conditions and command current monetary policy the heads of each federal bank are selected politically but with very heavy pressure from the community of the fed banks they elevate internally and the folks qualified to run the fed are always chosen from the top candidates that have elevated through its ranks it is not questionable that the vast majority of officials climbing the ranks in the fed system seek minimization of unemployment and maximization of economic growth they seek to make us all as a whole wealthier they don t operate in the realm of politics but the top fed officials are selected through the political system this is not ideal for any particular party or person but it s ideal for the greater good if economic growth is that greater good their system is not to boost the stock market if that was the case it would be a lot higher or would ve crashed horribly by now it it s meant to foster genuine growth and even it irrational market movements they don t achieve that goal all the time but that s what they strive for all the time that s the fed don t mistake it for anything else 	1

i was having a discussion with my friend the other day and for the life of me i can t understand his viewpoint he was saying that bitcoin s mining energy usage is larger than some countries i said even if that s true why is that a bad thing friend because energy still needs to come from somewhere me i completely understand energy needs to come from somewhere but why is it a bad thing if anything the energy requirements could and probably is directly contributing to development in renewable energy sources since bitcoin needs it to keep sustaining itself in the long run friend but renewable energy isn t anything near what we need it to be it just isn t developed enough me so just because renewable energy tech isn t up to par yet we should stop mining bitcoin he then went on about how unsafe bitcoin is but i put him i his place but really can someone help me understand this because if he s talking about the pollution aspect from fossil fuel sources then that s more of the energy tech issue than bitcoin right or does he have a point does bitcoin s huge energy requirements at this point in time mean it d be quite bad for the environment to keep going with bitcoin 	2

 5 months ago a user called pip published this apparently is one of the first to adopt bitcoins and decided to make a challenge related to cryptography to give away 310 bitcoins on october 2 the challenge began the challenge consisted of a photograph that using steganography and cryptography techniques hid the necessary information to recover 4 btc wallets 0 1btc 0 2btc 0 31btc and 310btc only two days later a user had already resolved the 0 1 btc wallet 7 days later the 0 2 wallet was resolved and finally only one day after resolving the 0 2 someone resolved the 310 but and the 0 31 intact to this day pip has said several times that he is surprised that he is still there since the 310 btc wallet was much more complex than the 0 31 wallet but it remains intact and the solutions of the challenge will not be published until that someone can decipher the 0 31 wallet what do you think someone who can solve it probably the solution is related to the letters and numbers that were not used in the 0 2 wallet solution i think the number 310 may have something to do the prize is 310 btcs and not 300 there is another 0 31 btc or 0 310 wallet the number 310 appears in the corner of the image i also believe that the fact that numbers and letters are in different background colors when those in the 0 2 solution are all with white background may be related amp x200b img j5dmp9yrqkk21 0 1 solution 0 2 solution challenge website 	1

this is a seed it can have more words depending on your wallet this is not a private key however priv keys are generated from it normally you should only see these words once when setting up your wallet and maybe one other time when testing your recovery mechanism third time only if you have to recover your wallet never enter this into websites and don t save it in notepad file on your desktop fortune unaware cat stick hazard athlete until step equip mammal client hobby this is a private key it was generated from the seed not exactly the above seed for accuracy sticklers one of these is needed for each address in your wallet it is in compressed format since ecdsa priv keys are longer this format or starting with l is what you would normally see when dealing with individual private keys for example you may import a private key into a wallet from a paper wallet or once it s emptied into bcash wallet to claim bcash most often you don t need to deal with keys directly let the wallet handle keys 5k9c7cjge4j6cbhkp9sgvskguafjlqkikztwsmaar1b962ngjjj this is a public key it was generated from the private key above it is unlikely that you will see or deal with public keys at all 04d821791444365317cad6a3f812736eecd7a93d425bf585dc8cc6f5a8b66fd298c967ad8bd4edf809fc45894e476a50ccc2c2a42c2eabecbb4d56b445709a8610 this is a bitcoin address it was generated from the public key above it is not a public key it is not necessary to say public address in pki public and private refers to keys addresses are just addresses not public nor private you can enter this into wallets for watch only purposes to keep an eye on the balance you can withdraw funds to it from an exchange or give it to someone to pay you it is a one time use identifier once it received money you should not reuse it 13ucwjdweqrgvdaxqh6artd6gnamvgyx4a	1

agreed that today btc is volatile and you risk to loose like 20 in one day some claim to have stablecoins for rescue and that they will be the future after all it makes sense you don t want to loose even 10 but now as btc worth 1 mln the manipulation and huge variations of 10 are almost impossible as we observe daily move of circa 1 2 at the best hence besides all the other benefits offer btc decentralised not backed by any dollars on bank account btc is also now coming with super low volatility amp x200b do you see the catch guys this is an article from 2020 back from future haha 	2
all amp x200b i would like to use this as a mean of disclosing and exposing a group of scammers their names are paul mahone and samuele maran i recognize and acknowledge i lost money and so others did there is nothing we can do here to get back our money but what i can try to do here is try to help others not getting tricked scammed by these two individuals i hope you will help me sharing the word or at least please be aware with who you are dealing with everything started back during the public token sale which was held in september and october 2017 roughly 5 million bitboost tokens bbt were sold for bitcoin and ether with a value at the time of around 1 5 million usd which in fact they raised the majority of the contributors were italian and i hope you ll show up here following up with my post stating your opinion and experience we need your word their token had to be a utility token used by sellers to pay for listing fees on their marketplace creating ongoing demand for the token just until before the actual ico they have been running the project smoothly they released the smart contract and all that stuff to make it look and sounds like a serious thing as soon as they ve raised the money they stopped working for the project they ve basically paused it claiming to be working on the marketing side of things this is just bullshit and we all who did the ico know it all the money raised during ico were wasted for their own stuff well now it goes the end of the story and the hot point on december 11 2018 they ve put up a post on medium stating good bye friends we ve ran out of cash and so forced to close the project this is it i perhaps like everyone else was literally shocked when i read that statement it is seriously insane and i was like this can t be serious what i am shocked about is the way they are trying to pull an exit scam and make it like it was not in fact a real scam it is as obvious as saying we ve used all your money to pay for our stuff and now we ran out so we re forced to close the project bye bye and thanks they ve been fine until now since i am confident that nobody as of now has ever made a post nor exposed this whole situation and i hope moving forward everyone who reads this and sees their face will know and remember who these guys are i will attach a few screenshots just to make sure things don t get deleted their medium post screenshot1 screenshot2 screenshot3 as a side note they ve written in that medium post that they will open their github so that we can track the actual development this has never happened and as of today 11 march 2019 their github is not opened telegram chats are also getting pruned clearly bullshit these two individuals paul and samuele managed to waste 1 5 million of usd in less than two year without even releasing the actual full product now please help me understand how exactly you managed to spend 1 5 million usd in less than two years show us where the funds went their last words in the medium articles says good bye friends friends are you serious do you think people can forget this whole scam let me tell you something paul and samuele we perfectly know that there won t be any repercussion what so ever but we also know that the crypto communities are strong together and that we won t forget your names and faces please help us sharing this story and making sure nobody else gets scammed amp x200b thank you for reading 	2

i stumbled across this medium post that had a game from hashhub which is essentially an app that pays out small sats for playing the game i downloaded the app and an associated wallet denryu and got me some sats when i first downloaded the mobile wallet i was asked to open a channel and stuff happened automatically in the background this wallet did not have any btc to open a channel i am not sure about the mechanics but a channel was opened to a hub node and i was able to transfer sats from the game that i had won to the wallet but when i tried to then transfer some of these sats from the denryu wallet to a wallet like bluewallet or my tippin page it does not seem to work it gives me an error that says lightning payment failed and refunded i even tried to send some sats from my bluewallet to the denryu wallet and the error i receive is api error payment failed does the receiver have enough inbound capacity amp x200b if any one from the community that has experienced this issue or has knowledge about the denryu wallet could you please give me any info that may resolve this issue i am not really technical but always looking for ways to be involved so experimenting with products like bluewallet which have a really easy ui and mask all the technicality under the hood 	1

just wanted to bring this new paper to you if going to comment please engage with the arguments abstract this paper discusses the economics of how bitcoin achieves data immutability and thus payment finality via costly computations ie proof of work further it explores what the future might hold for cryptocurrencies modelled on this type of consensus algorithm the conclusions are first that bitcoin counterfeiting via double spending attacks is inherently profitable making payment finality based on proof of work extremely expensive second the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of mining income via fees as users free ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain instead newly minted bitcoins known as block rewards have made up the bulk of mining income to date looking ahead these two limitations imply that liquidity is set to fall dramatically as these block rewards are phased out simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero it could take months before a bitcoin payment is final unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality second layer solutions such as the lightning network might help but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof of work which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation personally i m no longer in the proof of work world i moved to proof of stake long ago pow are getting 51 attacks more often too might implode anytime soon 	1

i know that reusing btc addresses to receive is not advised for privacy reasons however i have also heard there can be a cryptographic security risk when doing this in a certain way i heard that if you reuse an address after sending from it then your coins are actually more at risk of being stolen somehow because your keys are more cryptographically vulnerable i think it might have something to do with quantum computing anyway i am ok with the privacy risk that comes with reusing an address i have a ledger nano s hardware wallet and it is more convenient for me to reuse a receive address instead of having to physically get the wallet to generate a new one each time but i am not ok with reducing the security of my holdings at all could someone please confirm if my understanding of the 2 situations below is correct am i right that scenario a is not safe but scenario b is perfectly safe when i say private below what i mean is that the address has only been used once to receive scenario a not safe and not private 1 generate address x on ledger nano s 2 receive btc at x safe and private 3 receive btc at x safe but not private 4 send btc still safe 5 receive btc at x not safe and not private scenario b safe but not private 1 generate address y on ledger nano s 2 receive btc at y safe and private 3 receive btc at y safe but not private 4 receive btc at y safe but not private 5 generate address z on ledger nano s 6 receive btc at z safe and private 7 receive btc at y safe but not private 8 receive btc at z safe but not private 8 continue receiving btc at y and or z as many times as desired safe but not private 	1

hi my full node is successfully running since a few days with approximately 20 inbound peers as i often need to access it from outside my home i run it on a headless raspberry pi that i control through ssh usually from an ipv4 only network which is why i assume this is a dual stack raspberry pi capable to accept both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses all of the required ports are also correctly redirecting traffic to its local addresses there are two since it uses eth0 and wlan0 which means two ipv6 addresses what bothers me is that 100 of these inbound connections are from ipv6 nodes even though netstat tells me that the node is listening to ipv4 addresses 0 0 0 0 8333 additionally its ipv4 address score stays the same after a day even if externalip is set advertise my network s ipv4 address meaning it s unreachable to other ipv4 only nodes how can i tell bitcoind to use both ipv4 and ipv6 instead of ipv6 only 	2

original source here amp x200b mayer multiples the metric that helps call bitcoin bubbles and bottoms mayer multiples the metric that helps call bitcoin bubbles and bottoms amp x200b amp x200b calling precise market tops and bottoms is next to impossible in the volatile cryptocurrency markets that said some traders believe identifying speculative bubbles and moments of bearish exhaustion can be made possible through the use of a fairly new metric known as the mayer multiple created by noted investor and podcast host trace mayer the mayer multiple is defined as the multiple of the current bitcoin price over the 200 day moving average mayer multiple formula bitcoin market price 200 day ma value mayer multiple in technical analysis it s generally considered a bullish or positive indicator when prices are above the long term moving average ma whereas it s considered bearish or negative when the price is below the moving average however the implications are not that binary for example if the price is significantly higher than a long term moving average it s often a sign that the underlying asset has become overvalued or what is commonly referred to as overbought the opposite is the case when the price falls excessively below the moving average the mayer multiple essentially quantifies the gap between the price and 200 day ma to identify historical values at which point bitcoin enters a speculative bubble in other words when its price significantly exceeds its intrinsic value or points of seller exhaustion mayer multiple bitcoin amp x200b amp x200b mayer multiple bitcoin when using mayer multiple the two specific values to pay keen attention to are 1 and 2 4 the significance of a 1 multiple is simple any value above 1 means bitcoin s price has risen above the 200 day ma and any value below 1 means price has fallen beneath it by comparing multiples below 1 to its corresponding price action it is evident that extensive bear markets take place when price finds acceptance below the 200 ma on the other hand bitcoin s market favors the bulls when the mayer multiple is above 1 but there s an exception any multiple above the 2 4 threshold has historically shown to signify the beginning of a speculative bubble which is significant because all bubbles eventually burst causing a rapid depreciation by conducting simulations based on historical data mayer deduced that the best long term results were gathered by accumulating bitcoin when the mayer multiple was below 2 4 as can also be seen above the mayer multiple has never fallen below 0 237 the value that marked the bottom of bitcoin s first significant bear market in 2011 for reference the 2013 15 bear market reached a price bottom when the multiple showed 0 407 and the lowest multiple since then was 0 509 when bitcoin s price fell to 3 122 on dec 15 according to coindesk pricing data as the data suggests bitcoin s price is now reaching historically oversold levels so its presumed a bottom is in sight but is still capable of falling further away from the 200 day ma which is currently sitting at 5 343 further evidence suggests that it s highly likely the price finding acceptance above the 200 day ma creating a mayer multiple above 1 would confirm the beginning of a bull market and finally an above 1 mayer multiple could be considered a sign of a bull market a very high number represents extreme overbought conditions or bubble btc therefore could see a corrective pullback or an outright sell off in which case prices may eventually drop below the 200 day ma driving the mayer multiple below 1 however that could turn out to be a bear trap as a sharp drop from extreme overbought conditions to levels below 200 day ma is usually accompanied by short term overbought conditions an unusually low number could be considered an advance indicator of bitcoin nearing a major bottom disclosure the author holds btc ast req omg fuel zil 1st and amp at the time of writing bitcoin and chart image via shutterstock charts by tradingview continue reading here amp x200b 	2

what s being debated is really a deflation driven re denomination but there is lots of precedence for inflation driven re denominations new franc france new peso mexico new shekel israel new lira turkey new taiwan dollar brazil s many interesting new denominations probably many more i m unfamiliar with in a world where satoshis sats are a useful pricing denomination it would be clear from context whether denomination is sats new or bitcoin old since there s eight orders of magnitude difference during times of transition now there is confusion but trying to introduce a new named currency since it has a symbol will only increase that confusion also i think it s unclear whether the future new bitcoin denomination should be sats vs bits btc vs mbtc and if either of the latter are the case the sats denomination is all the more confusing another analogy would be stock splits when a company does a e g 7 1 stock split it doesn t get a new symbol my bias is that bitcoin should be simple for new users and general public and a new symbol for sats feels like a re branding that dilutes mindshare and increases confusion that s why i think successful re denominations and stock splits are useful analogies as are the perils of re branding consumer products with the opposite implication think the best counter argument is that general public has lots of experience with fractional denominations with the latin derived cent being the most common but even here i think there is trouble because 1 while the general public is aware cents in many countries there are fractional denominations which are only used by specialists and don t have a symbol for example in the us the lowest denomination established by law is the mill which is one tenth of a cent and one thousandth of a usd aren t sats especially now more like these specialist denominations 2 in most countries the general public does not use a symbol for cent which is sometimes and instead just abbreviates the word 25c or uses a decimal in written contexts 0 25 for everyone passionate about adoption and use of sats i think it makes more sense just to use s as an analogue to cents when working with sats adding btc if unclear whether you re talking about bitcoin and as bitcoin use transitions to a new base denomination whether it is mbtc bits or sats that can be new bitcoin consensus driven re denomination 	1

it seems like coinbase could be well equipped to re invent banking and by attaching itself to the current banking system it might be able to protect itself as a going concern advertising itself as a 100 fully reserved bank it could do this with a stable coin vanilla cd products fully transparent banking where customers know what the bank is doing with their money at all times obviously competing with fractional reserve banks would be tough because they have a significantly lower cost of capital but it seems like there are still be projects out there that need to borrow at higher costs of capital and perhaps conventional banks won t play in that space	2

i don t know why i thought about this but it came into my head and was wondering the answer does coinbase have an unlimited never ending supply of btc for sale if all of us ok all of us here plus many more people went all in today right now and everyone hit the daily weekly limit would coinbase run out of crypto for sale is cb the biggest h0dler of all or do they just serve as a middle man of sorts 	1
 this is the second initiative from facebook after they tried to introduce facebook points during 2012 and was not successful this time it may translate into a success due to the following reasons 1 feasibility of massive adoption facebook whatsapp and telegram active user base whatsapp alone has more than 1 billion daily active users and crypto transfer can be a click of button and trust is pre established telegram biggest messaging applications in south korea and japan kakao and line 2 similar successful products in the market venmo has taken off in the united states by making it easier to send payments by phone and in china many consumers use the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular wechat messaging system 3 ease of opening a facebook account compared to a bank account regulation and compliance is the next big puzzle to solve for facebook 4 unlike jpm coin backed by usd alone facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars euros and other national currencies held in facebook bank accounts the big question facing facebook is how much control it would retain over the digital coin if facebook is responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system rather than a traditional centralized system like paypal let us follow another interesting development 	1

this is advised against showing how much you have makes you a potential target if btc makes a big rise again people will remember that you have this now imagine if bitcoin rise again and the exchanges you had use to buy bitcoin track you and send hitmans to get your bitcoins they can do that btw they have your name address and sometimes your face picture how can we prevent against that 5 dollar wrench atacks are no joke amp x200b 	1

there are a huge people that look at bitcoin prices and expect to go as much as can go lower me included i look at a fair price to buy bitcoin everyone ignore vast majority of new investors it is not my fault that you bought at 20k by looking at influencers or public figures like mcafee said at hype prices 20k if i have a chance to buy 10x more bitcoins then you with same amount of fiat i ll take it i am pretty sure there are much more people that wait for fair prices then are people that bought at top why everyone ignores us so yes i do expect to buy bitcoin under 1k i have sold some parts of btc at 18k because you could see from moon how big the hype was i did not made the game but i play it very wisely and responsable i am sure that you gonna be on fire after reading this but hey don t blame people that look to buy at fair prices i also see everyone spreading and trying to find reasons how btc can go at 20k reality can hurt you more in the future the question is how many readers want to buy under 1k price 	2

so many people are trying to call the bottom so they can claim oracle status in the near future will btc double bottom will it fall to 3000 2500 1k obscure numbers like 999 have even been tossed out there and of course my favorite prediction 0 00 usd well the truth is it really doesn t matter in the grand scheme of things as long as the fundamentals of btc remain strong today and in the future by strong i mean the network must remain secure and continue to resist hostile takeovers from a plethora of bad actors and world governments alike such attacks can be computer software coded or physically introduced with the enactment of draconian laws or consist of emotional manipulation i e spread of fear misinformation via government amp bank controlled media outlets the possibilities here are endless despite all of this the people who remain in the market today beyond the media s short lived obsession with btc back in 2017 should not simply be labeled strong hands everyone here is susceptible to moments of capitulation but at the end of the day the majority of people following btc in the year 2019 know exactly where this technology has been and realize where this technology is headed if you believe btc will have a value of 0 then you have arrived extremely late to the party and should indeed remain on the sidelines indefinitely but for those of us who spend our days amp nights learning as much as we can about btc s history blockchain technology hard soft forks and just technology in general there is literally no usd price that would cause us to abandon this project well i used the term project but at this stage i m tempted to call it a revolution wolfoffusion	1

found this article via twitter tl dr do you need a public blockchain most certainly no cryptocurrencies are useless quotes from the article with my thoughts gt most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust they re fond of catchphrases like in code we trust in math we trust and in crypto we trust this is trust as verification but verification isn t the same as trust agreed it is better than trust gt what blockchain does is shift some of the trust in people and institutions to trust in technology you need to trust the cryptography the protocols the software the computers and the network and you need to trust them absolutely because they re often single points of failure agreed tho the distinction of elimination of trust and shifting of trust appears to be a problem of semantics nobody in his right mind claims that blockchain eliminates all trust instead it shifts the trust from arguably corruptible systems of human beings in power and institutions to the verifiable trust in code tho gt when that trust turns out to be misplaced there is no recourse if your bitcoin exchange gets hacked you lose all of your money if your bitcoin wallet gets hacked you lose all of your money if you forget your login credentials you lose all of your money if there s a bug in the code of your smart contract you lose all of your money if someone successfully hacks the blockchain security you lose all of your money all true gt would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don t have the expertise to audit whatcha think how about your expertise to audit the human legal system how about getting the expertise to audit the some computer code at least the basics the ressources are out there if you want to gt blockchain enthusiasts point to more traditional forms of trust bank processing fees for example as expensive but blockchain trust is also costly the cost is just hidden for bitcoin that s the cost of the additional bitcoin mined the transaction fees and the enormous environmental waste transaction fees fluctuate yet appear to be very low atm enviromental waste is a factor yet definite numbers and impact are highly debated gt bitcoin might theoretically be based on distributed trust but in practice that s just not true just about everyone using bitcoin has to trust one of the few available wallets and use one of the few available exchanges sounds more like 2013 than 2019 and as with every emerging technology this will get better and more diversified all the time as long as the technology keeps developing gt and we ve seen attacks against wallets and exchanges we ve seen trojans and phishing and password guessing criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin we ve seen this with conventional banking too gt honestly cryptocurrencies are useless they re only used by speculators looking for quick riches people who don t like government backed currencies and criminals who want a black market way to exchange money cliche fud speak for yourself gt to answer the question of whether the blockchain is needed ask yourself does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way or just shift it around it changes the system of trust to a distributed system of verification which is very meaningful gt does it just try to replace trust with verification it shifts from trust in financial institutions to trust in veryfiable code gt does it strengthen existing trust relationships or try to go against them it eliminates and or upgrades existing trust relationships which is a good thing gt how can trust be abused in the new system and is this better or worse than the potential abuses in the old system actually a valid question whatcha think gt and lastly what would your system look like if you didn t use blockchain at all the times 03 jan 2009 chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks 	1

hi bitcoin since i have not seen any posts about this i will drop the question here the eu is going to implement a new law which will give the people ownership of their own banking data things like transactions account number and location data way to go you would say right wrong right now many people use wifi websites services and just click the i accept buttons now what will happen if they will put these terms to the task of letting amazon facebook etc having acces to your data they could use this like cookies and set a price which will be tuned as you use your transactions or by the amount of money you have stored i might not have written this fully out but i think you will know what i mean with the above will this mean crypto will be more important than ever before is this the way around the system or just a privacy service what are your thoughts 	1

this isn t a faucet this isn t a shady miner website this isn t gambling if you are tired of dicking around on faucets all day here is what you do get gift cards and trade them on paxful local bitcoins how do you get the gift cards for free then rewards websites amp apps there are a lot of great apps that offer this some let you scan receipts for points convertible to money like receipt hog receipt pal fetch rewards and others some give you points for shopping for specific things like ibotta some give you money for surveys like swagbucks there are plenty of legit websites that give you gift cards for tasks now it may take some effort to accumulate points but in the time you got 5 or 3 to trade you are still at satoshi numbers on faucets yikes now yes lbc and paxful will take fees for your transactions but i think doing it this way is the best way to get your first dollars in btc free a much more profitable way to get bitcoin for free is by making your business support bitcoin but you still have to pay for your business so this is not free per se although this is not a way to get a lot of btc for free i think it is better than investing time and sometimes money on faucets and scams p s i know about crypto airdrops but they are pretty unreliable and most token they airdrop become useless in a month 	1

hi i am trying to calculate my short term capital gain tax for cryptos and would appreciate if you guys could let me know if i am doing it correctly i put two times some money into crypto in 2018 and then had several tradings in 2018 with loss and profit i have traded all of my crypto stack and then finally switched to usdt at the end of the 2018 but did not cash out to usd and they are in crypto yet so as the crypto to crypto is a taxable event i am wondering do i calculate this tax correct i subtract the total usd value of my cryptos in the last trade in 2018 let s say 31 dec 2018 from cost basis two times deposits which i had in 2018 and this will be my short term capital gain and should pay tax for this amount according to my tax bracket no need to go through the details of each trade one by one and just the difference of initial deposit and final value in the last trade in usd is relevant for tax purpose am i am correct or missing something here if this is correct wonder why one needs to go through all different webpage for crypto taxes and huge calculations and not use this approach to report their taxes thanks 	1

 i am also planning on including this in the next article i just wanted some feedback any constructive criticism is welcome did the feds create bitcoin is satoshi nakamoto just a clever attempt to cover their tracks good morning it is tim again i have been writing an article that is attempting to shine some light on the infamous satoshi nakamoto i have heard of so many candidates that its very difficult to narrow it down to a few people one of the scenarios that the feds created bitcoin to end fiat and implement a currency that could be traced 100 of the time i personally do not think the government created bitcoin but that won t stop me from having a bit of fun and writing about it when i hear the argument about the government being satoshi it makes me cringe i have always believed bitcoin was the people s money government issued fiat is not controlled by the people this is just one of the reasons i disagree with the idea that the us government is satoshi let s look at some of the reasons people believe the government was or wasn t involved what if the government did create bitcoin okay i made it clear earlier i do not believe the government was involved in the creation of bitcoin but what if they were the ones responsible let s discuss the reasoning and logic people use when they accuse the govt of deceiving us why would they want to create a currency like bitcoin well first and foremost bitcoin is traceable in this day and age if you don t understand that the govt despises privacy you are lying to yourself supporters of the theory that the govt was involved always use this as an argument the farther we move into the digital age the more important creations like bitcoin will become which leads people into believing the govt was possibly scared of being left out of the cryptocurrency revolution but let s look at the flaws in this logic why would the govt create a limited currency like btc why wouldn t they instead create a coin similar to dogecoin i mean the govt loves to print money at will that s why we left the gold standard in the first place the govt spending was kept in check when the gold standard was in place since it was abolished we have spiraled into massive debt to me it s not likely the govt would limit their ability to create money at will even dogecoin is mined and only certain amounts are released after each block is mined which means the govt would technically still not be able to print the currency at will instead they would need to mine it in my opinion the govt would never ever give up their ability to print infinite money it just isn t likely how often has the government given up their power and given it back to us i can t think of a single time what would a govt issued cryptocurrency look like okay we have discussed the reasoning behind the idea of the govt being involved in the creation of btc it may or may not be true but let s focus on what a united states federal issued cryptocurrency would look like in my opinion if the us govt decided to create a cryptocurrency i believe it would be very similar to the usd now minus the privacy one has when using paper bills let s face the facts paper currency is probably the most private currency in the world right now even more so than monero due to the fact that paper currency is not easy to trace there is no public ledger like btc has this is one big reason people assume the govt was involved in the creation of btc i can see the logic in this thought process but why do i disagree because the govt wouldn t ever limit their ability to create currency at will bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins that s all that will ever be mined there have already been nearly 4 million btc lost over the last 10 years that leaves us with approximately 17 million coins bitcoin will ultimately be deflationary the govt doesn t like that idea either its apparent that economists these days believe inflation is a good thing due to the fact it discourages hoarding and encourages spending i can see where these economists are coming from but i respectfully disagree deflation is a good thing for the people who wants to save when the money you are saving is only going to decrease in value over time the govt is not trustworthy but if you look hard enough you can see the way things work henry ford said it beautifully it is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning i agree with him your average citizen simply does not understand basic economics the us uses this to its advantage and that is why we are currently 21 trillion dollars in debt i am straying a bit so let s get back to the issue at hand what would a us govt created cryptocurrency look like well i believe that it would be inflationary mainly due to the fact the govt refuses to limit its abilities to create currency at will we should not expect the govt to limit their authority the cryptocurrency would likely not be mined due to the fact mining requires time and energy which would ultimately reduce the power to create currency it would be unlimited inflationary like dogecoin no cap on creation of coins like btc with its 21 million the difference is doge is limited to the amount people can mine nobody can just say print 10 billion dogecoin and make it happen it requires mining to acquire newly minted dogecoin the us govt would create a totally centralized coin one that could easily support reversed transactions one that would resemble the us dollar in many ways the main difference between a potential govt created fiat and cryptocurrency is the fact that with paper money out of the way the govt can now trace any and every transaction this is music to the govt s ears the coin would probably resemble the petro in venezuela you need to acquire it from certain places and kyc is a must not to mention the us govt could possibly force us to pay taxes and other things in their cryptocurrency venezuela is already attempting to force the petro on its citizens there would likely be no consensus mechanism proof of work proof of stake the govt would simply issue more when they wanted i wouldn t compare that to cryptocurrency but rather gaming credits or digital fiat unlimited and the currency could be created whenever they felt like it one more point to bring up is why would the us govt create a cryptocurrency that can be mined in china there is a lot of bitcoin being mined in china this just seems asinine to me why would the us govt create a crypto and sit back and watch china take it over im not saying china runs btc i am saying that if the govt created btc they would have mining farms the size of football stadiums china has been accused of controlling nearly 80 of btc mining at least at one point it did see the following link to explore where i got this information mining pools are a collective of people that put their hash power together to get better rewards for mining china is anti crypto when compared to a lot of countries the chinese govt does not appreciate bitcoin at all they regularly release a list of their favorite cryptocurrencies and bitcoin is rarely even in the top 5 the reason for that is china likes to control citizens just like the us govt even with this in mind the chinese govt encourages bitcoin mining mainly due to the revenue the govt collects from these mining farms if the us govt created a cryptocurrency they would almost certainly attempt to avoid this situation where china controls the majority of mining to be perfectly honest the only reason i could see the us govt creating bitcoin would be traceability and elimination of privacy when buying and selling especially on the internet i can t see the us govt being the entity behind the creation of bitcoin people point out that sha 256 btc uses this cryptographic hash algorithm was created by the nsa but that doesn t prove anything at all all it proves is sha 256 is very secure and that is the reason satoshi ultimately went with it another thing is these computer scientists and bitcoin advocates that i know aren t ignorant people from elon musk and jack dorsey i don t know these guys to people i do know like ash roulston dee tee etc all have high opinions of btc and brilliant minds to accompany their opinions these are smart people much smarter than me none of these people believe that the govt created bitcoin and neither do i i hope you enjoyed the write up written by tim pace

 amp x200b whether you are new to crypto or have experience filing your crypto taxes here are 5 very important things to note for your 2018 tax filings 1 cryptocurrencies are capital assets and profits are recognized as capital gains for each taxable crypto event a calculation must be made to determine whether you have a capital gain or loss to recognize these gains losses are reported on your tax forms these taxable events include selling crypto for fiat currency i e usd trading btc for alts or alts for btc using crypto to buy goods or services receiving crypto due to a fork or as a result of mining 2 losses can be used to offset gains and to reduce taxes if your crypto activity results in a net loss for the tax year you can use that loss to deduct up to 3 000 against your taxable income if you have losses in excess of the 3 000 that can be deducted against your taxable income the excess losses will be carried forward to the next year the losses that have been built up can be used to reduce capital gains in the subsequent year in addition the losses can also be used to reduce another 3 000 against the following years taxable income this will continue in perpetuity until the losses are all used up a simplified example 2018 10 000 in capital losses 3 000 are used to reduce taxable income thus there is a 7 000 capital loss carryover 2019 2 000 capital gain the 7 000 capital loss carryover will be used to wipe out the 2 000 capital gain in addition of the left over 5 000 in losses 3 000 will be used to reduce taxable income there is now 2 000 left in capital losses to carry forward to 2020 3 keep accurate records as we have seen over the past couple of weeks exchanges go offline and users have no way to access their records all taxpayers should constantly download their data as frequently as possible to make sure that they have adequate records keep records of all your cryptocurrency activity not just trading activity occurring on exchanges periodically download your trading history from any exchanges you use ensure you have a record keeping procedure to document all of your crypto spends 4 transfers from wallet to wallet and gifts do not create a taxable event when crypto is transferred between wallets or exchange accounts that are owned by the taxpayer a taxable event has not occurred however mining or withdrawal fees can be used as an addition to the asset s basis or a deduction from the proceeds that are eventually realized a gift does not create a taxable event for the recipient however gifted crypto that is subsequently sold will create a taxable event when you are gifted crypto you receive a carry over basis from the person who gifted you the asset this means when someone gifts you crypto get their cost basis information from them additionally the recipient of the gift receives the donor s holding period in the property for determining whether a gain is classified as long term or short term example you are gifted 1 btc in october 2018 from your friend who purchased the btc for 2 000 in may 2017 your basis in the asset will be 2 000 and it will have a long term holding period 5 1099 ks don t necessarily reflect you crypto income for the year if you receive a 1099 k for your crypto activity do not panic exchanges are required to send you a 1099 k if your activity exceeds 20 000 or you have over 200 transactions the amount that is reported on your 1099 k will not necessarily indicate the amount of gains or losses that need to be reported to the irs on your tax returns amp x200b www taxingcryptocurrency com twitter taxingcrypto amp x200b information provided on this post is not nor is it intended to be tax or legal advice please consult your tax advisor regarding your particular tax situation and consult a lawyer to discuss any legal advice 	1

in late 2014 years before the recent brouhaha over coinbase s latest debacle in re their decision to utilize someone from ht and all the negative implications of that i stopped using coinbase and bitpay old 2014 discussion on this which drew a lot of attention at the time at the main reason for me leaving coinbase bitpay bitstamp and a ton of other companies at the time in 2014 openly and explicitly announced their support for the windhover group s proportionate enforcement and risk based regulation which contained a terrible pill suggesting that all identity even future identities based solely on bitcoin blockchain or similar technologies should be deemed under sole purview and control of governments your identity of course is regulated and monitored any country s passport or state dl is a classic example but the state no longer has sovereign control and monopoly over money why should it for identity either this is to speak out against exchanges or brokerages that don t respect our agency and ability to create our own identity this is a ramble on why we shouldn t use coinbase bitpay stamp or other exchanges that fundamentally have acted against people s best interest not once or twice but persistently over years so what transpired then i closed my accounts with coinbase and bitpay in late 2014 it took a long time but it worked yes they retain business records that you had an account and details of that for years after business records laws but you should close the accounts i explored the decentralized trading and markets world a bit i was impressed with o b and what eventually became bisq though then it was still very much under early development in those years what is now bisq didn t see heavy development until 2017 though technically it was under development in 2014 2015 under the bitsquare name i eventually cautiously commended and recommended a handful of centralized exchanges you can count them on fingers of one hand though in terms of the actual good ones that haven t fallen prey to coinbase level evil that had done well in staying secure and defending the users their client base these were and are exchanges that decided not to go the route coinbase amp bitpay took in 2014 you know who they are if you have been here awhile check out kraken therock trading and more recently hodlhodl these are good there may be some others but very few centralized exchanges are seriously devoted to protecting the users as part of a business model in reality can they do better sure are they doing their best to help and protect clients including against repressive systems yes i spent a lot of time after 2014 assessing how modern licensing regimes affect people and then i threw myself at helping defeat bitlicense in california ca bitlicense proposed as ab 1326 in 2015 defeated with help of eff bitcoin foundation plug and play tech center john light bruce fenton and thousands of others in california but it came back twice again its later proposed zombie form was ab 1123 2017 2018 which we also defeated we realized the author dababneh was going to bring it back again and again even though we defeated bitlicense proposals in california each time they were re introduced what to do suffice it to say dababneh is no longer in office he can no longer legislate but keep an eye on his replacement the price of maintaining a market free of such garbage or largely free of it is vigilance bitlicense was defeated in various other states too it currently only exists in the usa in ny which caused the best exchanges to decide to leave new york you know who they are the ones operating in ny have caved to it don t support them do bisiness elsewhere help permissionless innovation take root around the world vote with your wallet somehow this all eventually got me on a path to actually getting work in crypto i then went from a mostly unemployed bitcoin advocate to working full time in crypto for an organization that i can safely say has some of the very best people in the industry it is nonstop work and is a real blast it is not just the future it is now if you like working hard and helping improve people s lives crypto is for you and yes more and more philanthropic organizations and nonprofits are now accepting and working with bitcoin that is a growing part of the future of this endeavor 	1

let s face it the internet has been disastrous for the surveillance capabilities it has opened up to corrupt authority around the globe this is not because of the design of it but because everyone chooses to do all their private communication through facebook messenger gmail or some other pretend free service the future where bitcoin use is ubiquitous but nearly everyone you know uses and moreover expects you to use companies like coinbase who s product will switch from selling exchange services to surveillance is a 100 disaster they will build regulatory moats the likes of which don t even exist in email making the problem far worse and they will allow people to deposit withdraw and trade for less than anyone else or even free because that will no longer be how they make their money their profit will come almost entirely from data selling or advertising which of course will be targeted based on your data given away disrespectfully nothing is more important in this space than destroying companies who s businesses rely on such evil practices they must be destroyed because if they exist people will use them and convenience trumps liberty for almost everyone this is 1000x more important than them supporting 2x meth ripple bcash or any other scam coin or hf corporate take over attempt those all have the option of failing in the market place but the monitoring of the on and off ramps away from fiat currency will define the future of the world profoundly what is most convenient will be what remains from the bottom of my heart and from every not just here to get rich cypherpunk left in this space fuck coinbase	1

cloud mining research cloud mining profitability described research on cloud mining based on open source data the rapid obsolescence of mining equipment and its high price made professional mining not profitable for most users and this forced both mining service providers and those left behind as a result of this arms race to look for alternative solutions the exit was found quickly enough cloud mining it seemed to be the revolutionary step in the world of cryptocurrencies the company buys high quality and modern equipment for mining makes it set up and sells to its customers rents out such kind of service made possible for people to join crypto rush without buying and maintaining expensive mining equipment however in the current state cloud mining business is not profitable with a growing network s complexity and bearish market it was more or less viable while bitcoin s exchange rate stayed high but after it s price fall more than in twice mining rewards are barely enough to cover maintenance fees not to mention any valuable profit as an example of cloud mining industry development we have collected and analyzed the open source information about major players of the market and market itself two business models generally there are two main models of the cloud mining business first when the company buys equipment itself and provides its customers with cloud mining contracts directly at first glance it s very simple yet quite complicated for the business because the company needs to combine both hardware and customers management the second one makes the chain longer replacing one providing company with two different subjects reselling business and hardware facility in this model the quality of service of the reseller directly depends on the endpoint hardware provider however it s the most popular scheme due to lower business founding expanses nevertheless both these models won t work if the hardware maintenance and service fees are higher than the final profit and in a case when the final profitability depends on several values even a small change in one of them may cause the overall business unprofitable and that was a case of bitcoin cloud mining in middle 2018 the network difficulty of the bitcoin blockchain raised significantly from 2 6031t in january 2018 to 7 455t in october 2018 and finally to 5 814t in january 2019 while the exchange rate of the cryptocurrency went 70 down jan 2018 jan 2019 electricity price 0 11 0 12 difficulty 2 6031t 5 814t net hashrate 15 171 p hs 41 339 p hs profitability per day 20 30 3 68 price for 1 btc in usd 14000 3500 results for antminer t9 asic in china antminer t9 was chosen as the optimal device due to its value for money and good computing power with relatively low power consumption consider the example of large market players how this idea developed and what it turned into in the end cloud mining pioneers genesis mining was founded at the end of 2013 by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts started at the very beginning of the blockchain and cryptocurrency era it became an enterprise level solution for cloud mining with 6 cryptocurrencies listed and 1000 gh hashrate for each of the listed currencies genesis mining proposed several plans including 3 preset options and 1 custom solution where user decide himself how much power he needs all things went well until the start of 2016 the issue is that during the 2016 network difficulty of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies raised significantly in bitcoin s case almost tripled yet contracts remained on the same level of proposed hashrate so the final income of all genesis users decreased respectively genesis mining team has foreseen the chance that someday contracts may become unprofitable so according to the project s terms of service if cloud mining contract becomes unprofitable company stops charging the maintenance fees for next 60 days hoping that contract will come profitable again in order to provide its users with higher quality service and higher chance to get rewarded within their cloud mining contracts genesis mining made several software and hardware updates last one in early 2018 which but they didn t help the last step from the company s side was making possible to pay maintenance fees in advance to extend the 60 day holding period so contractors could prolong their period of waiting for contracts get back profitable the first complaints in social networks about closed contacts appeared in august 2018 genesis cloud mining contracts gone sold out out of stock in mid 2018 late july early august start date march 2 2014 contracts sell stop web status changed on out of stock btc 28 11 2018 dash 11 12 2018 eth 11 12 2018 ltc 10 12 2017 xmr 10 12 2017 zec 10 12 2017 limited stocks and sold out contracts hashflare was another one major player on the market of cloud mining services since late 2015 with headquarters based in the uk hashflare got a number of offices and data centers all around the globe main mining facilities as it is in most of the cases were placed in georgia and iceland due to low electricity cost and legislation loyalty just as genesis mining hashflare has been proposing various plans for mining various cryptocurrencies bitcoin ethereum litecoin zcash dash however it was not the only same thing the payback period of any of these contracts was way too long around 350 370 days to be profitable for clients in short and mid term and continuously growing network difficulty made them unprofitable for long term too hashflare strived to make changes in their software and hardware however it leads them to nothing hashflare s cloud mining plans are out of stock since july 2018 also from june 2018 users started talking about closed contracts there s still ethereum plan marked as limited stock yet nothing happens when you try to buy it start date april 18 2015 contracts sell stop web status changed on out of stock btc 14 06 2018 eth limited zec 04 05 2018 ltc 09 06 2018 dash 07 01 2018 awesome partners hashing24 was founded in 2015 however the team behind it was working since early 2012 so it s legit to say that the project was made by a group of blockchain and cryptocurrency pioneers one more fact staying for hashing24 is that this cloud mining service used to be an official partner of the blockchain giant bitfury unlike genesis mining and hashflare hashing24 have had no pre set plans for cloud mining yet users were free to choose the amount of money they d want to spend or hashrate volume they d like to buy and as many other services their contract used to be lifetime until profitable but after networks difficulty rapid rise period the average contracts payback time got close to 380 days after which contractor meant to start earning his profit in fact during this payback year network s difficulty obviously rise and alleged profit got leveled cloud mining contracts of hashing 24 got out of stock in the middle of 2017 since september 2018 the network also has feedback on closed contracts due to negative returns start date november 18 2016 contracts sell stop web status changed on out of stock btc 04 09 2017 contracts terminated 24 08 2018 closing the gate the ease of use of the service is a distinctive feature of minergate since 2014 thanks to this the pool has gained such popularity among beginners the launch of cloud contracts on a pool that often experiments with new services was a matter of time the sale of cloud contracts started on minergate at the end of 2016 all contracts were for life that is they were considered active as long as they generate revenue despite the growing complexity of bitcoin minergate continued to keep contract yields at an acceptable level how exactly is not clear but since the profitability equation is made up of the cost of electricity which remained almost unchanged over the period of popularity of cloud contracts the efficiency of the miner and the need for its maintenance which was charged regularly it is most likely a matter of partner diversification it is highly likely that minergate was a common intermediary involving various providers in the execution of cloud contracts but such a scheme could not exist in the market for a long time cloud contracts cannot be bought from late september 2018 in january 2019 many contracts began to show sharply reduced returns in february feedback about the closure of cloud contracts began to appear on the network the main question is why so long start of sales december 2016 presumably the end of sales 2018 late september irrelevance of strategic partnership in 2014 hashnest was acquired by bitmain which became a supplier and service company for cloud mining for bitmain this was the first experience of buying a startup in the field of cloud mining at that time the company was actively expanding its competencies trying to become a leader in everything related to mining a distinctive feature of hashnest was also the marketplace where users could buy power from each other the user could buy as power for 1 day or buy asic in permanent possession however with a negative yield of more than 5 days the contract ceased to be executed and was considered terminated now it is impossible to buy new contracts the marketplace is not displayed and the support of the service claims that the work will be resumed from day to day without naming time in social networks you can find a lot of feedback from people whose contracts were closed at the end of 2018 the solution to technology and geography these cases demonstrate how strongly bitcoin price and network complexity affect profitability and the ability to continue mining but is it possible to improve the quality of equipment and lower electricity prices will be able to return services to the game traditionally mining was concentrated in countries that provided minimal electricity tariffs pay attention to georgia viniswell

countries in addition to the price of electricity it is important to take into account the overall level of infrastructure and political stability in the country for this reason venezuela with its low electricity prices is not the first choice at the same time relocation often involves such expenses that the transportation of equipment may make this operation unprofitable but everything again broke about the increase in the complexity and cost of the asics themselves the growth of complexity depreciated the new devices in 2 months transforming the payback process from monthly to annual at the same time the devices are not going to become cheaper since the part of research and development behind them must also be paid off the situation with asics looks really bad even those devices that show profits simply do not have time to work out their own value before obsolescence difficulty grows faster and the bitcoin continues to fall so this is it from the examples above it becomes obvious that even large players cannot support the infrastructure of cloud mining against the background of the growing complexity of the network and bearish market trends the solution that would allow realizing the entire idea of cloud mining is currently not profitable most of these businesses were founded with a view to the exact network difficulty and the specific exchange rate of the bitcoin as soon as both these criteria have changed in the worst possible way difficulty went higher when the price went lower such kind of industry doesn t work for those who do not have their own computing power or coins based on the proof of stake algorithm but would like to mine cryptocurrency rental of hashrate directly from other users and connecting leased power to mining pools is a more preferable option 	1
i feel like everyone is buying the hype and is truly believing we are going though another bull run like 2016 i honestly have not bought this hype and i m still waiting for btc to dump even more 	2
the narrative that another crypto is the real bitcoin is causing i am certain real people who are being misled to lose money by either investing in something that they don t intend to by accident or because they are being given misinformation facilitated by the ownership of bitcoin com as has been mentioned before if bch supporters were sincere in their belief that bcash is superior to btc they would make the distinction clear even sell the domain a clear indication of their desire to derive benefit from the confusion is discussion of bch vs btc so often whereas a rational approach would be to discuss its merits over another crypto that it is closer to in marketcap it is in danger of slipping another notch below a competitor so that it could well instead of being 6 it will become 7 which i believe is a very big problem in terms of credibility they should be discussing merits over this crypto in an attempt to prevent this slippage but instead it is only btc and lightning network that are discussed and denigrated is the only strategy that bcash supporters can come up with to take advantage of confusion and attempt to boost bch by i guess knocking a crypto with 30 times its marketcap this to me shows and i am not a psychiatrist something like delusions of grandeur if that is the right sort of diagnosis i doubt that my advice will be taken but i would take smaller and presumably more effective steps and attempt to encourage people to see the merits of bch over binance coin which could in the next few days overtake bch in marketcap even stellar is a danger to them and if trading volume is an important measure even ethereuem classic is a competitor 	1
i recently made a post on the beginner sub and mentioned i was using this wallet and someone replied saying why on earth you are using a wallet which does not even have any traffic on it i am not sure if you were advised to do so but please use some wallet which keeps your cryptos safe after all its your hard earned money i m a total noob and only have about 100 in btc right now and was keeping it on coinbase but after reading stuff here i thought i was seeing a lot of good things about this wallet so i got it and sent my satoshis there i eventually want to get a trezor but not until i have enough bitcoin to justify buying it will i be ok using hodl wallet for now thanks 	1
theoretically if you were mining using a bog standard pc on your own not as part of a pool there s a very slim chance that you will solve the proof of work on a valid block and claim all fees and block reward right obviously the chances are minuscule but how do they compare with the odds of winning the lottery jackpot for example if you bought a lottery ticket every week for a year are you more likely to win the lottery than if you mined on a normal pc in the same year 	1

what i see on this cryptocurrency logic for now is this we don t usually trade goods and services with bitcoins cryptocurrencies we almost just trade them for another fiat currency we use today and that determines it price for me the logic is like this gt miner mines 1 bitcoin gt buyer 1 wants to buy 1 bitcoin for 40 usd gt buyer 2 wants to buy 1 bitcoin for 60 usd gt miner sells it to buyer 2 for 60 usd and the current price is 60 usd against 1 btc gt buyer 2 wants to buy for example a bottle of wine for 60 usd but he only has 1 bitcoin which will for sure not be accepted by the liqour store he then sells it for 60 usd gt buyer 3 and buyer 4 wants to buy the 1 bitcoin only for 40 usd so buyer 2 has no choice but to sell because he needs something that the liquor store will accept so this results into bitcoin being valued at 1btc to 40 usd for now so in short its value depends on how much fiat currency are people willing to trade with it this ain t real money for me since it s still connected to a fiat currency which people usually trade with btc i m curious what will happen for example instead of defining its value from a fiat currency people started selling goods and services for bitcoin without relying on the exchange rates for example people makes a starting fixed rate for goods and services like this 1kg of chicken 0 015 btc 1kg of pork 0 012 btc in short all im asking is what if a country for example relied on pricing of goods and services on bitcoin without thinking of the fiat currency exchange rate instead they make a fixed price and adjust the pricing of btc depending on the demand of the chicken and the pork or simply goods and services not because of the changing of its equivalent fiat currency does this cryptocurrency thing have a future in driving the economy or this will be just an asset forever that people make money with another form of currency 	1
