"I put together a list of reading material u/coblee had shown in his tweet.  It reads like an all star list of cryptographers.  Some of them, such as Felix Weis' article discuss different confidential transactions from other papers.  

&amp;#x200B;

I thought other people might appreciate the list.  I will be very very extremely interested to hear about the direction Charlie Lee plans to recommend for Litecoin given there are quite a few variations and takes on confidential transactions.  

&amp;#x200B;

Very supportive though of the direction he is going with Litecoin.  Specifically that fungibility is the most important missing property.  I don't know if the scaling debate is totally behind us, although there is a clear road there and so while work still needs to be done the path to get there seems to be clearly articulated.  Looking forward to hearing his thoughts on fungibility and that best route to achieve that given the clear pros and cons in front of us.

Seems like if ""institutional money,"" decides (or is stealth deciding now) to bull run LTC before the halving we will get closer to 1/4 ratio than ever before?  Comments?"

"At Safeway today, I just got an old $10 bill back in change - and it definitely looks like it may have been a few places over the years! Maybe this bill started out its life decades ago on the East Coast, and worked it's way all the way over to where I live on the West Coast? Maybe this $10 bill was put into a Church offering plate more than a few times, but then too it was probably used to buy some joints at a school in the 70s,  or a porn mag in 1988 and then again in 2001?  Maybe it was used by a tax evading farmer to pay an off the books migrant worker far less than he was worth? Maybe it was stolen from it's rightful owner a few times?...

So. is this $10 bill in my pocket a ""good"" bill because of where it has been and what it has been used for and by whom? Or is it a ""bad,"" bill for all the same reasons??? I blissfully don't know - and don't really care - it's $10 bucks!

Which brings me to my confused understanding of fungibility in action as it applies to Bitcoin and Litecoin: I have vaguely come to understand that a specific Bitcoin can become ""tainted."" Does the TAINT only attach at the point of mining creation (sort of like knowing the origin), never to be scrubbed off because it came from a ""bad"" miner? Or, can a Bitcoin (or Litecoin) become TAINTED years after it was created (because some idiot bought child porn with it)? 

But is this understanding WRONG: Is it that only the txn history of the SENDER can become TAINTED and not a specific coin?

The North Korean's likely have more than a few Bitcoin and Litecoin lying around that they may have obtained and used in various ""tainted,"" ways - but what I guess I am hoping Charlie or someone explains is can those coins eventually be sent back into the West with no consequence for the new receiver? Or would our government come knocking on such a receiver's door and say, ""sorry hand over your cold wallet - the Bitcoin on it was used for something illegal 5 years ago?""

I don't get why Litecoin isn't already like my $10 bill example right now.  Thanks for any education on this.

    Hello,   I am a member of the many Discord channels, and we're discussing discord Integrations with Twitch, Steam etc..  We would like Discord to include Litecoin(LTC) as an integration so we can link a donation address to discord.  This could be very simple. It would require an input field, QR Code converter. Then when people go to Discord Profile and click ""LTC"", a QR Code would come up on screen. Once the transaction has gone through perhaps a notification could be sent to the user.  Thank you for this consideration,  Best"

"Just read an article that said the real reason TWITCH dropped crypto payments (the number ONE reason) is because the US government still classifies crypto as property, therefore ANY kind of purchase no matter how small or large requires the reporting of ""gain or loss,"" on each of these sale, ""ehem - I mean purchase, cough, cough.""

I know in an old video Charlie once said that the idea with fiat on-ramps is that you would go into crypto and then never come back out.  The implication was if you observed this practice you didn't need to worry as much about triggering IRS events when you purchased stuff.  But are there any LTC holders out there who HAVE purchased bigger ticket items with LTC?: Plane tickets, motorcycles??? And if you did, what SHOULD have happened? And have you run into problems???

This is an important issue because it drifts into Charlie's fungibility push (I think, but then again maybe not).  If someone secretly finds a new gold mine in the forest and starts stock piling seriously large amounts of gold into their garage, AND if they melt and refine it down into many, many bars of gold, they are INDEED very VERY RICH in one sense - but maybe not that rich in another: how are they going to PARLAY that gold into things they want or need without loosing a lot (or maybe all of it) to the government? Will current LARGE bag holders face the same problem if Litecoin makes it past 1K?

It seems very large bag hodlers will be relegated to a life of slow leaking their cypto fortunes out only a very little bit at a time...for coffee.

I know someone out there will say, ""well the guy with the gold bars could just start trading them out for stuff: Maybe private buy a lake cabin in non-disclosure of sale price state - here is a bar of gold, give me the cabin.  But this isn't how many want to live with crypto.  And people need to realize that if you show up to your average job one day in your new Lambo, they IRS is going to come knocking on your door.  My strong hunch is that the IRS isn't going to go after coffee purchases made with LTC at all - so everybody can knock themselves out on that front and not worry too much if you missed reporting.  But what is the deal with larger dollar value items, and where is that TIPPING POINT? 

Charlie I know you want everyone to #Paywithlitecoin, for everything - but can they really do this without this downside right now?  And if this article is correct, then do you and the LF recommend just hodling instead - until the law changes and crypto is no longer classified as property? Finally, is this the reason Amazon isn't so interested in taking crypto right now?"

With the administrator's permission, I hope you give me permission to publish this. I do not want to break the rules of this group.

https://i.redd.it/449v4cmzntu21.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

I know that many people should ask for some kind of help in these publications and people think they are scams. That's why I posted a picture of my situation, and they can add me to any social network to verify everything I say.

My name is David Torrealba and I am studying 8 semester of librarianship at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. I have worked in load boxes, in a bookstore, in a car, in sales, but no matter how many salaries you have in Venezuela, it will never be enough to feed a family in Venezuela. My parents and I work, and even though my parents have two salaries each, in my family we only generate about $22 a month, when the basic basket in Venezuela, which is the budget needed to eat, is $300 a month. Not counting cleaning products like soap, toilet paper. Just one packet of toilet paper in Venezuela costs almost 9 dollars. Only with the budget of my home, I can buy 3 packs of toilet paper.

The economic inflation in Venezuela is so strong that a flour that cost in September 2018, 50 sovereign bolivars (national currency), today costs 5000 sovereign bolivars, increased its price x 100 in just 6 months. Not to mention that most Venezuelans only eat twice a day, as they don't have enough money. A bitcoin group in Brazil raises money to help Venezuelans, and thanks to this group helped me and I was able to buy food until February and I was able to publish in this group everything I bought, unfortunately people get tired of helping and it's understandable, who would help a complete stranger so much?

If someone wants to help me or add me to facebook to talk to me and know the need we have to spend millions of Venezuelans, I will leave the link to my facebook and any portfolio that wants to help me, I will publish everything I buy with your help. In my facebook I have managed to distribute food to several of my universities and I have a support group for Venezuelans. Believe me, you can compare the david torrealba that appears in my facebook profile picture 6 years ago, with the current David Torrealba.

"In the last few days I have purchased the  Raspberry Pi 3 to set up a node.  I believe I have it set up, but not 100% sure it is running.  I used this as reference to set it up.   [https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/creating-a-litecoin-node-on-a-raspberry-pi-3-the-easy-way-on-windows-8e78d4da1af5](https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/creating-a-litecoin-node-on-a-raspberry-pi-3-the-easy-way-on-windows-8e78d4da1af5)  

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a screen attached to the Raspberry Pi 3.

I have a few questions.

1) The screen goes to sleep and I can not get it to wake up, with out restarting.

2) I am looking for printed info on the commands for Litecoin core.  I know if I type Help I get them on the screen from the Raspberry.  But its kind of small and I can not scroll up or down so I can read all of it.

3) I am assuming if the Raspberry Pi 3 is on, then Core is running.  Yes or No?

4) I am looking to make sure that Core is running all the time.  I believe I can checked this by typing a command, but do not know what it is, this is why I am looking for all of the commands.

5) How long does Core need to be running before I would see it on this list?   [https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ltc/#!network](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ltc/#!network)

Thank you for your help."


"Pardon my ignorance as I’m fairly new to the whole crypto world and am trying to understand the following: it seems to me that in order for Litecoin to be successful in the long run, it needs to start being used as currency. Is it fair to say that the majority (if not all) of the owners of coins are investors? As an investor in Litecoin (or any crypto for that matter), why would I want to ‘spend’ any of my coins if I think they’ll be worth more in the future? "


"I was updating my Electrum LTC Wallet and after the update, the contents of my wallet were sent somewhere. In other words, my wallet got emptied upon updating. Does anyone have any idea why this happened and if I can retrieve my litecoin?"
Is it possible to clone the Ltc chain but change the block time and difficulty so that all blocks are mined in Genesis block? 

"I really dig the new logo, but I have to admit, it's a bit disconcerting how fast and immediate the change of logo has been, for what is a decentralized cryptocurrency. In barely a few days, we have almost completely switched to the new one.

Merchants have mass-produced certain products (in my case, playing cards, that aim to spread awareness of cryptos to the general population, through an already existing and usable market) with the original logo. Such a quick change, without notice and without any debate beforehand is in my opinion problematic for the image of Litecoin.

Thousands of websites/wallets/blogs/guides/etc. must now change and adapt their visuals to be accurate. As for all the physical objects (t-shirts, physical coins, mugs, caps, socks, etc.), they are all stuck with the old logo. 

And there's no guarantee it won't happen again in 2 years when a new ""better"" logo comes up.

I don't feel it's a good thing for Litecoin to operate like this. Sure, you might say that the merchants can go f*** themselves, but I feel merch are still a great way to spread the word around about Litecoin.

Just my 2 cents as a Litecoin fan and embarassed merchant who now has thousands of playing cards branded with the ""old"" logo."

"Hey guys,

Currently I have 1 Litecoin stored on Litevault that I want to move over to LiteCoin Core.

I tried sending it from LiteVault to my LiteCoin Core wallet however it seems like the send function isn't working and a message pops up saying if you need your coins now you can export your private key. I'm pretty new to all of this so I'm really not sure how to go about doing this, any help is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also from my understanding if I were to import my private API on LiteCoin Core I would basically just be moving my Litecoin over right?"

"I'm still new into the world of crypto. I was wondering how is a currency affected if it's primarily being HODLED by the majority rather than exchanged around?

I hear of deep pocket investors I suppose known as ""Whales"" that have large stakes in a currency and HODL them instead using them. How does this affect a crypto and is it a benefit or does it ultimately hurt it?

"




"First let me give you some back story. Robbie Coleman and the team at The Tokens Agency are big fans of Litecoin and wanted to design a new logo for Litecoin because the old one is a bit outdated and doesn't scale well. (See original post of the classic logo: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140642.0;all](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140642.0;all))

[classic silver logo](https://i.redd.it/swd3shkgkjc21.jpg)

Robbie came to the Litecoin Summit last year all the way from Australia to pitch to the Litecoin Foundation their new design. What Robbie and team came up with is a single grey color logo with a thinner L. We really liked the new simpler look and decided to start using this new grey logo.

&amp;#x200B;

[new grey logo and name](https://i.redd.it/3x6rkkxjljc21.png)

When the UFC sponsorship was in planning stages, we figured it makes sense to debut this new logo on the octagon mat. The problem was that this grey logo would look horrible on the grey mat, so I immediately asked Robbie and team to help us figure out a good blue color that would look good and stand out on the mat. It also became quite clear to us that the grey logo would really not work in a lot of places.

&amp;#x200B;

[new blue logo and name](https://i.redd.it/j9vfvzximjc21.png)

A lot of people were very happy with how the logo looked on the UFC mat. Because of all the positive feedback, we decided to incorporate the blue logo in our branding guidelines: [https://litecoin-foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LC18-007-Brand-guidelines.pdf](https://litecoin-foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LC18-007-Brand-guidelines.pdf)

Now, let me address the issue some people have. They don't like the new logo. Or they don't appreciate the fact that it seems like a centralized decision. First for all, there's really no way to reach consensus in a decentralized way on a new logo. No single logo or color will please everyone or even the majority of people. It's always going to be split with people having various different opinions. But the thing about the decentralized coin is that everyone has their say. People are free to use any logo they want. They don't like the new logo Robbie and team designed? It's fine to stick to the classic silver logo. I'm still quite fond of that classic logo actually. If they like the new grey one, use that. If they want the logo to stand out from a white or grey background, use the new blue logo. I think [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) looks so much better now with the blue litecoin logo looking great even at that small size and it really stands out among the other coins.

Know that there is no such thing as an ""official"" Litecoin logo. This new Litecoin logo is just the one that the Litecoin Foundation recommends. We will use it for websites and applications that we work on. [litecoin.org](https://litecoin.org) uses the grey logo. Litecoin Core 0.17 will use the blue logo. Other websites and wallets are free to use whichever logo they want.

Now let's put this logo controversy behind us so that we can focus on more important things like releasing Litecoin Core 0.17."

Web wallets are managed by third parties in general – that is they hold the private keys and the public keys of the user – meaning that the process of accessing TerraGreen coin or any crypto currency is significantly lowered – you don’t have to download the full client or acquaint yourself with various forms and methods inherent in wallet software.  
   
 The tradeoff though is that the third party is responsible for maintaining the integrity of your wallet and keeping secret the private keys – you need to trust them as they could just run off with the money – and there is no Government based insurance scheme to guarantee deposits.

The advantages of web wallets – apart from the general simplicity – is the ability to bundle transactions together before pushing them onto the blockchain and therefore lowering transaction fees. They can also perform internal transfers for zero fees as an attraction to pull in customers and increase their user base – a bitcoin ecosystem within the bitcoin ecosystem – again TerraGreen is the perfect example of this, whilst offering wallet, exchange and Point of Sale services – they have garnered a very large market share pushing other payment services such as Bitpay to adopt the same strategy and vertically integrate into wallet services from Point of Sales and exchange provision."

Good evening everybody

I have been out of the crypto’s for quite a while now. Got all my assets safely stored on my ledger nano S. However I am wondering if it is recommended to move my ltc funds from the legacy wallet to a segwit wallet and if so, how could this be accomplished on a ledger nano S. I tried the easy way to create a additional wallet on the ledger nano S and choose the segwit variant and just send over the funds, however I am not able to choose an segwit address.

Could somebody please elaborate on this? Your help is kindly accepted.

"Litecoin will exponentially grow by pushing LTC-LN.


#LTCLN/#DevWithLTC is just as important as #PayWithLTC.
Think about it: with just 100 nodes and 1000 channels, LTC has gotten so much press and added a billion dollars in market cap in the past few weeks. 
Imagine what even more nodes on the network and also devs developing LTC lightning apps will do for LTC. Guys like Mike Novogratz that famously called LTC a ""poor man's Bitcoin"" will have to pretty much eat their words.

I believe mainstream adoption will come in the form of layer 2 lightning and Lightning network mobile wallets like Neutrino. I think LTC will see most of its growth on Layer 2 once phones adapt to crypto (Samsung s10 recently introduced a crypto vault, so its already starting)

If LTC allocated more funding to growing Lightning network ecosystem, we'd see an exponential growth rate for Litecoin....Bottom line. Invest in strengthening LTC core foundations of Lightning Network to support building of the new Litecoin ecosystem/economy/Future LTC Internet."

I was going to go with Prohashing, but I saw that you need to submit some kind of a bullshit IRS form and since the whole point for me is to build some crypto OUTSIDE the financial system, this option is a no go. Thank you very much for your tips! "

I am new to the whole Litecoin scene and the whole cryptocurrency in general. I am using the service Coinbase to buy and sell Litecoin thorough. I was doing my research before I buy and saw there was a 3.99% on debit card purchase which I am ok with but also saw that people were being international fee because Coinbase used back then(2017 post I was reading) a London Compnay to process the payments. My question is will I still be charged the fee being it is two years later or does Coinbase still use that company.

First of all:
I'm using 2 Ledger Nano S, both are using the newest Firmware plus i use the mobile Ledger Live App on my iPhone to check my account balance.

I have the following issue:

I'm using the Ledger Nano S more than one year and everything was working fine untill today.

I wanted to transfer Litecoins to a new Litecoin Wallet onto my Nano S, which i created via Ledger Live Desktop App. I double checked the adresses and filled the via copy &amp; paste in Coinbase to transfer the Litecoins.
After a couple of minutes i checked my iPhone and the account balance was showing the correct amount of Litecoins...so far so good.
Then i checked my Desktop Ledger Live app, and there was no new transfer listed - the new created Litecoin Account shows me 0 LTC. Back to my iPhone: Everything was fine.
Then i cleared the Cache - nothing better...Then i deleted the account, and wanted to re-add the account: Shock! Only old Accounts listed, but not the Account, to which i transfered my Litecoins. After that i configured my backup Nano S from the Seed, made a Firmware Update and checked again - opened Ledger Live and wanted to add a Litecoin Account: the account was not listet.
Meanwhile the account on my iPhone still shows me the correct amount of LTC on the correct account.

What can i do?? It seems, that the account was not properly saved on the Ledger respectively the Ledger Seed. "

Well today in light of the recent price increase I decided to check on my single little litecoin to make sure he was still doing good. When I logged onto the coin base (quadrigacx) I was greeted with the message that they have gone under or whatever and basically stole everyone's coins.

It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of Luke the litecoin. I probably should have moved it to a personal wallet although I never really looked into it much as I didn't really think too much of it. I'm personally glad that was all I lost and didn't have multiple coins.

I was looking for a concrete answer but couldn't quite find what I was looking for.

I am trying to send LTC from one address to another and it's asking me what network fee I'd like to use:

High, Standard, Low, Custom.

Now considering it's not in that much of a hurry per se I was thinking of using Low because that's the lowest fees (right?).

Changing from High to Standard to Low keeps the ticker on ''100 litoshi per byte''.

What exactly does this mean? How can I calculate how much fees will be taken. Trying to not pay a load of fees by accident here.

"Dear members of the LiteCoin community,

**TL;DR: Uninstall Moon, Revoke your Coinbase API Keys NOW and PROTECT YOUR LITECOINS**

I was the co-founder and CTO at [https://paywithmoon.com](https://paywithmoon.com/). Due to my discovery of the unethical business practices Moon Technologies, Inc. has been engaged in, I have left the company.

As of today, the moon browser extension manipulates the DOM of the users' browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience, one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency. Over the past couple of months, my co-founder, Kenneth Kruger, has ordered the collection of data belonging to users as a way to improve customer experiences. No users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt-out of tracking, a feature which I regularly insisted should be added. If you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under [https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/](https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/) (dated 26 Feb 2019), you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions. **This is a huge breach of GDPR and privacy laws that are meant to protect user data.**

From the moment a user installs the browser extension, the company will know exactly what pages are open on the user's browser, what the content of those pages are, and what the user is doing with them.

The biggest and most alarming issue of all, is the process of collection of how the browser extension works in the backend - Coinbase API keys. From the moment the user initiates the connection between the company and Coinbase, the company watches for changes in the user's current window, waiting for the user to complete the one-time passcode (OTP) verification process as required by Coinbase. Once that is done, the company programatically clicks the required permissions (scopes) required to create the API key as it sees fit.

The API key is then shown only once on the next screen, but the user does not know this (done via CSS manipulation). The company extracts the API keys into our backend, stored in **plain text** on the company's database on AWS. This is a definite security antipattern. **This API key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user**.

When I asked Kenneth Kruger why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking IAM policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have **personal** access to our users' API keys, Kenneth Kruger constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect users.

Only two days ago, I have been locked out of my organization accounts including AWS and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users.

**If you are a user of our browser extension today, \*\*\*PLEASE\*\*\* you need to uninstall the browser extension via** ***chrome://extensions*** **and go into** [***https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api***](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) **and revoke ALL your API keys NOW.**

If you have not used the Moon browser extension, but know of a friend that might, please inform him or her to do so immediately.

You can read more about my experience in another post here [https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what\_to\_do\_in\_the\_event\_you\_get\_zuckerberged\_in\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what_to_do_in_the_event_you_get_zuckerberged_in_a/).

I had created Moon as I was crazy enough to think I was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency, accelerating the future of the financial system. However, today is truly a sad day for crypto. Until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations, the no-accountability attitude and greed many executives possess, we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency.

Until we meet on the moon again, please be safe, not sorry,  
Alexander Ang"

"Can someone explain why we have heard the narrative that ABRA choose LTC to be it's underlying backbone but they had to start out with BTC at launch, but it doesn't get pushed much.   I have had a Chat with Ahmed at ABRA recently where he confirmed they are all switched over to LTC now as of the first of the year.

At the same time I've read articles that Jack Dorsey (I think) believes BTC will be the sole backbone for all on the blockchain.  But, I thought LTC and LN and Atomic Swaps were all created so that LTC could essentially take the ""backbone,"" role for BTC transactions.

So I don't quite understand what is happening when Bill at Abra and Jack at Circle speak SOLELY about Bitcoin in this way. Are they just thinking that the BTC brand is so much stronger - so why confuse people about LTC's critical role - and just lump it all in and call it ""the Bitcoin / Blockchain?""  

Can someone confirm what is going on here?"

"I have been on flap watch for over a year, and I always felt I saw an echo response from BCH every time LTC surged.  Remember how LTC has flapped BCH before - but then BCH would respond and just barely claw back over LTC in market cap - FOR NO APPARENT REASON: No good BCH technicals, or news developments.  It was like ""someone,"" got spooked that LTC had overtaken BCH for a few hours - and found a way to correct that.

Today, we flapped EOS, with a massive 30% surge - and we were pulling away.  But then the same thing happened as above - out of no where EOS surges back just enough to take the number #4 spot away from LTC. This is just a few days after Valtalik Buterin called EOS a pile of centralized garbage (along with Tron - Jeb McCallum has said this too).  So there are some big smart names out there trashing EOS just days and weeks before this huge Litecoin surge.

Yet, here we are today, watching both BCH and EOS put in 12% plus gains, trying to catch Litecoin.

I haven't paid too much attention to the crypto conspiracy FUD in the past, but watching this BCH/EOS mirrored response is starting to make me wonder.

Many say Coinmarketcap doesn't really mean much; but it is HUGE to the timid NOOB investor new money that might wade into crypto for the first time.  It is HUGE to due diligences types, it WILL BE HUGE to institutional money for the same reasons.

Once again, Charlie could not have timed the BEAM announcement any better - just a few weeks before Fidelity and Baakt go online!  Having those institutional dudes look and say, ""Hey LTC is in the #4 position now - lets dump a bit more into LTC guys,"" is fantastic.  

But does anyone think that BCH and EOS bag holders (China?) are saying, we can't get bumped out of our traditional higher MC positions over LTC, we have to pump back up?

Hopefully some extreme LTC rocket boosters will kick in here over the weekend to finally flap BCH to permanent death - and hopefully EOS too - with a giant MC pull away from those ""inferior,"" cryptos.  Litecoin is on it's way back into the top 3 cryptos!

I feel like I've entered the crypto equivalent of Kafka's The Trial. Customers *deserve* to know why they've been denied. I don't care what kind of fraud you're dealing with as a company. There are dozens of other players in this space who make it work.

When crypto businesses act more unethically than the players they stand to topple, we need to ask ourselves if what we're striving to achieve is worth it."

"Hi all,

I have developed a concept for real world usage of LTC to facilitate cross border trade, the concept is valid for all POW ledgers and does not compromise on decentralisation. I'm reluctant to give out details but was looking for some advice. I am based in the UK and was wondering if anyone would be able to point me in the right direction with regards to finding a backer to get this fully fleshed out and off the ground.

For safety and security reasons the person would have to be a public figure and easily identifiable.

I have spoken to Ilir at the LTC foundation and provided an in depth run through of the concept but would like to engage with other reputable parties.

Cheers."

"It is always more fun to get to the WHY behind someone's position.  Recently, there have been tweets and articles that once again throw shade on LTC.  I am pointing to Novogratz' ""glorified test net,"" comment a month ago and Tone Vays recent tweet swipe at BTC, and this from a CCN article stating: ""The bone Tone Vays has to pick with Lee surrounds a Swiss-based project called TokenPay, which partnered with Litecoin for a stake in Munich-based WEG bank. Vays suggests that Lee’s influence has influenced others in the crypto community for TokenPay like sheep being led to the slaughter."" What does he care, does it take market share away from some investment is stuck with?

Okay, Okay Novo and Vays - so you are both trying to convince us that you are really concerned that folks are being led to, ""slaughter???"" by chosing LTC??? AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME??? Please someone enlighten me on what is really going on here.

I guess I do remember an old hatred that I had towards BCH in the early days - thinking that if that fork had not taken place then LTC would have captured some of BCH thunder and market share - inching us forward to that .25 BTC ratio.

Is this current BS coming from Novogratz and Vays sort of the same as my old BCH hatred (which is lessened)? Do they see LTC's ""continued,"" existence and ""clawing up,"" the ratio as sort of ""diluting,"" BTC's current value and future IMAGE??

I don't know - I just can't quite see the angle yet.  To me it still looks like BTC is so vastly ahead of everyone it can more than afford to let LTC splash around in the shallow end of the pool - like a great, and kind big brother.  But these two guys: Novo and Vays don't see LTC that way. Why?"

"I'm trying to get a paper wallet added to Loafwallet, but when I do the transaction keeps saying that it has been blocked due to not being synced with the blockchain. I've done that a number of times now and the coins are still not there, though explorer.litecoin.net shows that the coins are still in the paper wallet. I also can't re-scan the wallet code to add it back into Loafwallet - it doesn't do anything when I hover over it. Others(empty) it scans fine.

Little over a year ago I bought and sold some LTC using gdax. When the price crashed I still had unused funds in my gdax account.

New computer and see it's now called coinbase. I sign in with no problem.


They not only do not have my unused funds from a bank transfer but also my still owned LTC is not showing up. I double checked my bank statements and it clearly shows the funds taken out and the deposits made from my sales.. All in December of 2017. I still have thrle email receipts from the purchase and sales.

"App Link Below (Only Android for now, I'm waiting on Apple to approve the iOS version, will update here when they do):

LINK TO PLAY STORE: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbis.orbis

Thanks for taking the time to read this. As described I created a map based social networking app for Android so people can mark their city's personality groups in a map and then *meet up offline*.

This is the home page: https://imgur.com/kRFbKX7

Works like this, you download the app, share your location and then signup (you can use it w/o signing up but since I just published it that probably won't be very useful around your region).After signing up you create a group or join an existing one.

Example of your screen once you join a group after signing up: https://imgur.com/lA7Maiz

Once you create/join a group you can checkin by pressing the button with the location symbol on the home page which is also the map view. This will prompt google to fill up the nearby places around you, you can also do a GPS checkin or create a place you don't find on the list.

Example of places to checkin: https://imgur.com/4dBmIQn

Once you checkin to a place with your group, this will bring you to the map view where you will see the circle with the symbol of your group show up spinning around the place where you just checkedin at.

Example of circle on the map: https://imgur.com/f66aC8c

This will also automatically create a place page for the place where you checkedin , you can see that by clicking on the recently created circle.

Place Page: https://imgur.com/Xy6o1tO

This circle on the map marks the territory of your group. If there is more checkins on this place, the circle will inflate, and if days go by without anyone checking in that place, the circle will deflate until it dissapears. If other groups checkin and create group circles around your circle and those touch, the oldest circle deflates upon touching, so it's like a competition for territory in this sense. Groups also compete to have the most checkins on a place and therefore ""conquer"" them, this can be seen on the place page where the group that is place owner has the majority percentage of frequency.

The groups you join/create have a full suite of features like newsfeed (so you can post photos, text &amp; videos), places owned by the group, calendar of events, members. You can check it out by clicking on the group name.

If my explanation confuses you a bit I'm sorry. But the app in itself is very simple and the UI is very minimalistic, there aren't many users now b/c I just launched but please check it out for yourself and be my first users!:

Why I am doing this ?

I have been very inspired by old maps I've seen on map related subreddits like /r/ MapPorn, specially a map called Orbis Terrarum, which is considered the first modern atlas, in homage of this map, I named my app Orbis. ;)

From a philosophical perspective. I believe there is a secret map of society that is composed of personality groups that are in and around a city/region, everyone knows where certain groups hang out on their city/region, but this is not very well defined, I hope this tool can help create this understanding and hopefully become some sort of modern compass of the personality tribes of the now. I hope this app can bring the same sense of wanderlust that a person from the 15th century would get from looking at an old map of the world and imagine the undiscovered misteries out there. I try to replicate this feeling and bring it to a more local level in app format.

I just published recently, so if you find any bugs please let me know and try to reboot the app (usually rebooting the app works out many bugs).

Try to go through the whole experience of creating a group and checking in so you can understand the concept. I have facebook &amp; twitter connect but if you are privacy sensitive, you can login with pseudonim and an email (sort of how reddit has it's signup process)

All in all, thanks for reading it this far and let me know what you think. I will be reading the comments and suggestions here."

I've seen some custom Litecoin Adresses like: LTCPooLqTK1SANSNeTR63GbGwabTKEkuS7 (litecoin pools wallet) and i wondered if it would be possible to make that sort of adress for litecoin since it works for bitcoin would it work on litecoin too?

"I am pretty sure I have heard Charlie use an alternate description for Litecoin (alternate to his usual, ""silver to bitcoin's gold"") - I believe he has called Litecoin a ""Clone of Bitcoin / Bitcoin Clone,"" in some interviews, and perhaps that description should be pushed forward solely for branding. 

Terms like: ""Cyborg"" (Star Trek and UFC) and ""Clone"" (Star Wars, Biotech), are very up to date millennial terms, and each has a lot of marketing POP to them. Let's not forget that this is the primary group Litecoin is marketing to.

There is nothing bad at all about the term ""silver,"" but when coupled with ""gold,"" it is possible that some people do think of 1800s mining and old coins. 

I would argue that saying Litecoin is a ""Clone of Bitcoin,"" is indeed a far more accurate description.  It really is a clone of bitcoin - so why not say it all the time?  It still implies that Bitcoin was first and always will be - but leaves room for a faster/better ""clone,"" narrative to start to take hold with the questioning new user/mass adoption crowd saying, ""Oh, Ok, I get it - I am just buying a clone of Bitcoin.""  

The silver message is more than a bit contradictory in the marketing and branding sense. Charlie is saying, ""silver,"" which everyone associates with being something ""less than,"" gold in everyway.  BUT ALL THE TECH AND FUNTIONS of LTC say, ""faster, better, cheaper, newer, more advanced,"" than Bitcoin. Litecoin is the next gen coin!  LF branding and marketing should shift to the term ""clone,"" as it completely avoids that contradictory feeling in most people. 

Holding almost ""white knuckled,"" onto the silver narrative has also lead to the predominately, ""white and silver,"" logo (which I still think is one of the best in crypto) - but those are the easiest marketing colors to work with.  There has indeed been a small shift for Litecoin to ""baby/sky blue,"" (and yes our friends a Twitter would tell us that color combo worked for them).  But why not shift to an extremely cool color like an indigo blue.  I have been pointing out on Twitter that when Tmobile went from pink to magenta it ""played a significant part,"" in the huge growth of Tmobile.  

I think in this crypto winter downtime Litecoin could do the same color shift (my vote is indigo-ish) to an amped up image (the drawn logo design is extremely close already) that get millennials pumped to just wear a black Litecoin T shirt even if they have no idea what it is at all! Right now at this very moment, it is probably harder to get someone who knows little about crypto to be all that excited about putting on a Tshirt with a bit ORANGE B on it - see what I mean.  Litecoin's L however HAS potential (as much as Tmobile's letter T ever did) - as long as the L get's surrounded by the very best logo and colors in all aspects.  And to do that, it has to given the freedom to fly away from the ""locked in,"" SILVER narrative.

I think it is already happening in baby step - it just need to be entirely cut loose now.  ABBA choose purple and white (and it looks cool and cutting edge). Why shouldn't Litecoin's circle be indigo with EITHER a black or white L in it? It would pop even more on a UFC mat!"

"Litecoin and LF has great ""in-house,"" advocates, with Charlie clearly being at the top of that list.  But who would folks say has given Litecoin the greatest boost with their ""endorsing,"" comments about Litecoin?  I would likely say it is STILL Bill Brynhart at ABRA. 

It is absolutely great that we are getting additional impactful supporters like UFC Ben Askren - but what is really needed is another Bill or a bigger Bill.  For example, if Elon Musk said he really thinks Litecoin is going places, that one comment alone would be huge.  Who are we realistically on the verge of getting a nice new endorsement from in 2019?"

## Our Roadmap for 2019. Extremely Positive News

&amp;#x200B;

[Stable Mining Team](https://stablemining.biz/?ref=cypherswann) is here and we have **extremely positive news** for all our investors.  


As you have probably read in our previous news, our investment campaign had one specific goal, namely, to collect the necessary amount of funds **to buy new equipment and build new data centers**. That is why we began to attract investments and see them as**selling shares of our company**. Here, at Stable Mining LTD, we are well aware that it is impossible to always attract an infinite number of investors and pay **such a high interest rate**.  


That is why some of you were concerned that such unrealistic promises are like a fraudulent scheme. And **we do understand your concerns**. Moreover, there are actually a large number of fake fraudulent sites that promise high profits, but never pay. Let us clarify some details. **We try to be as transparent as possible with you**.  


Previously, we mentioned that after reaching 25,000 investors, we will close registration for new members, but **will continue to pay income to all registered partners**. However, our Financial Department together with Top Management of Stable Mining LTD revised our strategy in accordance with the current financial situation.  


**After analyzing the situation**, we came to the conclusion that it is illogical to rely only on the number of investors, and **it would be more reasonable to consider the percentage of funds that our company spends on payments to investors.**   


Despite such high interest rates, currently Stable Mining LTD spends about **33.5%** of the company's profit as payments to investors. Our management decided to increase this amount to **49%**. Thus, we can assume that the controlling stake in the form of 51% of the income will remain with Stable Mining LTD, and everything else w**ill be paid in the form of dividends to our investors**. As soon as we approach this goal, we will certainly inform you.  


**Whatever our competitors and enemies say, we will continue to work and delight you with stable daily payments!**  


*Best Regards,*

"Hey guys. So I've been browsing previous threads and scouring Google search results for an answer, but I'm at a loss. Apparently there's no way to delete app cache from iOS, even after deleting the app and its app data. So here's the situation (iPhone 7, iOS version 12.1.2):

* I installed LoafWallet, created a new wallet.
* I was prompted with the first word of my Paper Key (seed phrase)
* I navigated away from the app by pressing the home button
* Navigated back to LoafWallet, it's asking for the PIN.
* Proceeds to sync.
* Attempt to create New wallet within LoafWallet
* Prompted for the old wallet's Paper Key (which I don't have but 1 word of)

&amp;#x200B;

There was a post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/7i39ds/how_do_i_make_a_new_loafwallet_i_forgot_the/) detailing these exact issues and /u/losh11 stating he would be working on a fix for this (over a year ago). I wanted to know if there's any progress on this, or any way to Reset the LoafWallet app to be able to create a new wallet? Note that the post linked is a year old now and no mention of it since, and this seems like it could be a **HUGE** issue for iOS users."





"I'm making a LN node at the house and have some questions. I have a small 4-core CPU with plenty of ram that I plan on running Ubuntu on. I'd like to run BTC LN and LTC LN along with a few other minor nodes. I wanted to know from the community what the easiest or ideal set up would be. From what I understand, if I just run lnd, I'd need to be sure to explicitly point out BTC or LTC. Is this the case of I just run them both from BTC/ln and LTC/ln docker images? Or would it be better to run these separately in private vm's? Or should I go thru the hassle of just running both wallets and learning how to direct LN traffic? Is it as easy as setting up a .conf for for each once? What advantages/disadvantages are there to each method?

I'm no Dev but am persistent. I've been following LTC and crypto in general since 2012 but have been a reader of George Selgin's for longer. Being able to actually build the new free banking model is exciting to me. Any assistance is greatly appreciated."

**Speaker:** Felix Leupold @Gnosis

**Topic:** dƒusion — A Scalable, Fair Exchange

**Brief:** Centralized exchanges can be exploited by strategies like arbitrage trading or front-running. Today’s ‘decentralized exchanges’ are solely non-custodial: trades are still settled via pseudo-continuous order books, reserving the ability to front-run and arbitrage trades. Introducing dƒusion, a fully decentralized exchange that moves beyond these limitations. dƒusion collects limit orders for many token pairs in discrete batches and clears all trades at the same arbitrage free price. It achieves scalability through the use of succinct zero knowledge proofs (zkSnarks). These proofs can be provided by all participants in the network removing the need for a single operator.

**Speaker:** Brett Robertson @Ethereum Cat Herders

**Topic:** The Ethereum Cat Herders: Project Management in a Decentralised Ethereum

**Brief:** Ethereum has grown rapidly in the last few years and now has many branches working on different areas all for a common goal. As projects grow and develop they can experience some teething issues, most of which can be addressed by better coordination and communication. In a large open source, globally decentralised project of nascent technology, this can be hard. This exactly what the Ethereum Cat Herders are keen to address to help drive Ethereum forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**#30**

**Speaker:** Mo Dong @Celer Network

**Topic:** Build and Operate Internet-Scale dApps on Celer Network

**Brief:** Despite its high potentials, off-chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved. For example, how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on-chain operations? How to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off-chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks? How to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off-chain dApps? How to guarantee that off-chain states are always available for possible disputes?

In this talk, Mo will describe how Celer Network solves these challenges. Celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain dApps; and an incentive-aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off-chain state availability. He will provide their vision for Celer Network 2.0, a grand unification of all off-chain scaling technologies into a single solution.

**Brief:** Zeming will talk about the use of ethereum within the security token offering space.

&amp;#x200B;

**#32**

**Speaker:** Michael Yuan	@Second State &amp; CyberMiles Foundation

**Topic:** Creating a Rules Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine

**Brief:** Smart contracts are immutable programs on the blockchain. They are automatically executed based on pre-defined rules. However, complex and inferencing rules could be extremely difficult to program, test, and validate, using standard programming languages like Solidity. The long sequence of highly nested IF / THEN statements is fragile and error-prone. The problem is compounded by the need to frequently change rules based on business requirements.

Past enterprise software vendors have long relied on Business Rules Engines (BREs) to solve this problem. BREs allow business analysts to write transactional (state changing) programs in a specialized programming language called formal rules language, which can be generated by graphical user interfaces. BREs automatically evaluate, re-evaluate, and execute those rules. They have been proven successful in traditional financial services.

With the Open Source Lity project, we have developed extensions to Solidity and the EVM to support a BRE for smart contracts. In this presentation, Michael will discuss the benefits and use cases of rules language and engine for smart contracts especially in the context of financial services applications. He will further describe how the rules language is designed and implemented, including compiler and virtual machine runtime support.

"Hi all

I hope i'm posting at the right place .

I'm trying to develop some code in python3. 

The goal is to query the litecoind daemon on a linux machine .(I found some website which have an api to explore the blockchain , but i'd rather the program to be autonomous)

&amp;#x200B;

The query would be the following : 

generate a wallet (public and private keys) and put it to a file:

get the list of transaction sent to an address (passed as parameter)

so far i found those two python lib .

[https://github.com/IsThisThePayneResidence/python-cryptocurrency-wallet-generator](https://github.com/IsThisThePayneResidence/python-cryptocurrency-wallet-generator) 

and 

[https://github.com/blockterms/lit](https://github.com/blockterms/lit)

&amp;#x200B;

but it seems they have  not been updated and as far as I understood litecoin is still evolving . 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions :

Do you think those lib are (still) reliable ? 

Do you know any other python lib , that would help me to do want i want ?? 

Do you know a simple way to pass my queries to the litecoind without any specific lib  ?

"so I have read about sweeping/importprivkey, but I am struggling to understand how this meshes with the fact that new addresses and keys are created. exodus says that multiple private keys will be shown, one for each address. but the recovery instructions I read speak as though there is only one key.

is it like this:
send 1 ltc to xxy priv key yyx
send another but now new address xyx and key yxy

so now I go to view private keys and I see two, one for each address. so if I were to hypothetically sweep one of those private keys and address I would only get one of the coins?"

"Main idea:

Dogecape will be an MMO game that will completely free to play! Players will be able to explore the world and complete quests. Players can then use those items to sell them to other players for Doge. The in game currency which can be converted to crypto or usd. Players will also be able to go on horde runs.

MMO Economy:

On the mmo portation of the game people can go on Dogecape and complete quests to earn certain items. Players can also grind/find material to create new items. Players can sell these items to other players. The game doesn’t set a defined cost/sell the price for an item that is defined by the player base. For example, let say you found a diamond skull which is a 1 out of 56,890 chances of finding. You try to sell it for 50,000 Doge, but the market price is 23,000 Doge. You can hold to your diamond skull until market value increases and then sell it. We will make it so you can sell your ingame items on a secure website for usd or accepted cryptocurrencies. Only accepted crypto so far is dogecoin and ether. \[[Dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com/)\]

The beginning shop:

Before the game is released we will sell limited items to the community which can only be bought before the game is released. After the game is release the items can no longer be bought from the company but form each others.

Quests:

Quests will be a long or arduous search for something. Quest awards will be a various amount of items. Harder quest will earn rarer items and the lowest more common items. An example of a quest is, “Mine 1000 stone.” which you may get stone skull.

Converting

The ingame currency doge will be worth:

* $1 = 1000 doge
* 450 Dogecoin = 1000 doge
* 0.01917025 = 1000 doge
* 0.00841866 Ether = 1000 doge \[Soon will be added\]

Horde run

If your bored with grinding and quests you can do horde runs. Horde runs is an arcade style combat with waves of enemies. Up to four players can join together to fight against 50(editable if you want) waves of the Horde. The difficulty increases as the players advance through the waves. Horde can be played on any multiplayer map.

CBD interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system – a series of receptors that regulate pain, mood, the immune system, memory, stress response, and other important functions.  CBD is non-psychoactive and will not get a consumer “high”, and no lethal dose of CBD has ever been recorded.

"**Chain-Bet.com** currently operates on Bitcoin blockchain. It is standing on a very simple question - **What would be the last digit of the block hash that includes your transaction?** Because of its nature, people can play it directly from their exchange wallet.

But, as bitcoin blocks are found in every 10 minutes on an average, the game is slow. It'll definitely be faster on Litecoin blockchain, as blocks are found in every 2.5 minutes on an average. Moreover, being less congested blockchain, mining fees will be far lower.

Now, I'd like to ask to the litecoiners, how many of you will be interested to play (or invest on bankroll) such a game done on Litecoin blockchain?"

"So this post is a result of the conversations that resulted from the post linked below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/adp5ik/litecoin_foundation_some_thoughts_on_our/


As many people are excited about (myself included), Litecoin recently partnered with the UFC. In response to this news, I brought up a few questions regarding the nature of the agreement between the UFC and the Litecoin foundation.
   
   My main question that I don't think has quite gotten a satisfactory answer yet was ""What did the UFC get out of it?"". I wanted to know what the UFC would stand to gain from partnering with any cryptocurrency at all, and also Litecoin specifically. If you read one of the discussions in the post I linked, it talks about an NDA being signed, which kind of puzzles me because those people are beholden to Litecoin miners and hodlers (for example, if a significant number of miners said ""tell us what the NDA said or else we are shutting down"", you would most certainly have to divulge that information).

   I have been thinking about this for a while, and I will layout a/some possible agreement(s) that were made between the Litecoin Foundation and the UFC. You can view the members of the LF like consultants that are skilled with and very knowledgeable about Litecoin and how it works. Dana White could have a need for the utility that Litecoin brings, and thus a need for these consultants and their services. Litecoin probably has one of the best development teams in the world of crypto, hands down. It seems like an obvious choice for someone like Dana who wants continuous support as crypto technology develops further. If this was the case, then it does seem like a pretty legitimate deal took place.

   Another possible scenario was that the LF had to offer the UFC something in return for the partnership besides their services as consultants. This is what got me mildly suspicious and caused me to inquire more about the partnership. In the linked post, someone mentioned that the LF just gave the UFC money, but that did not seem very realistic given that it would be very expensive and just an odd place to spend advertising dollars.

 My concerns were that this sounded too much like the scenario where Floyd Mayweather endorsed some shitcoin, so I wanted some transparency. I was not accusing the LF of anything nefarious anymore than an audit accuses a company of cooking its books. I am a proud LTC hodler, and I want to do my part in making sure it's integrity stays strong.

Best,

"
"Hi friends! 

So the common understanding is that crypto transactions can’t be reversed. That said, and with the goal of adoption in mind, how will refunds or under/over charges be addressed?

For refunds I suspect it’s as easy as sending the exact amount back to the sender.

But what about under/over charges? Will there be a built in fail proof feature to performing transactions avoid this?"

"Alright so I know there has been quite a few posts on the phishing attack with the wallet, but I couldn't find any that answered my questions. I'm pretty new to this and am trying to self teach so I'm sorry if any of this seems obvious. I'm an idiot and fell for the phishing attack. My main question is will changing my password be enough, and allow me to use the same wallet or should I get rid of the wallet and get a new one. Second question: how do I dispose of my initial electrum ltc wallet and download a new one. I have tried using the download file but it keeps sending me to my old wallet and I can't figure out how to generate a new one. Again, I'm sorry if this is super easy and obvious. I just don't really know where to start finding the right information.

TL;DR: I fell victim to a phishing attack, and am wondering if I need to replace the wallet entirely or if just changing my password will be enough."



"Hello all,

wanted to keep this short and to the point for now, I am helping with the PR work for a new Texas based LTC mining pool. The purpose of this post is to gauge interest in the concept of miners willing to switch or rotate from pool to pool for the sake of keeping hashrates distributed across the network and not centralized. Here comes the experiment, 0 fees for miners that switch in the name of decentralization, dont stay on the pool for more that 7 days at a time. If things go beyond the experiment, everything beyond pool operating costs will be claimed under a 5013c that will cover the domain and node.

Welcoming input and hope to have an official update to this thread in the coming weeks.

"After having set up a few Bitcoin lightning nodes, I thought I would try to do a litecoin lightning node.

For litecoin I got a $27 120gb SSD, so trying to push for a $65 or so litecoin lightning node.

&amp;#x200B;

But the first problem I initially hit is there are no arm builds for litecoin core on [litecoin.org](https://litecoin.org)??? Is that really true? If we want to keep up the narrative of gold to silver, and cross chain swaps, you'd think they would have a build for the Raspberry Pi and try to match the ongoing excitement of litecoin on the lightning network by making it easy. I am just putting this idea out there... Was kind of looking forward to being able to get a litecoin lightning node up in just a few hours since the blockchain is so small, but maybe Ill just spend time on bitcoin if I have to go build litecoin core myself too."

Our cafe is looking to implement crypto payments into our options at our point of sale.
Currently, we are using Square payments, and we are tired of waiting on Square to adopt crypto integration. This is being run off of an iPad (iOS).
Our ideal solution is a ""receive only"" wallet on the iOS device, that we can key in the amount and receive with the QR code. Management/ownership would have a copy of the wallet on their device with both sets of keys, and can transfer/convert when ready. In other words, the store employees would not need a passcode to enter the wallet, and can only receive funds. This would eliminate the possibility of theft from them, or from someone stealing the device itself.
Any ideas on open source wallets that can accomplish this?"

2) BTC will pump massively to astronomical numbers of $250,000-500,000+ and LTC will also pump but maintain its ratio.

I think number 1 to be more likely over the next few years but I want to know the opinions of everyone seeing this.  If you think number 2 is more likely to happen, can you explain how we would get to that point?

&amp;#x200B;

With the shorter decision making pipeline that has a focus on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, the lead up/aftermath of the halving this year, possible new litecoin core developments, the inclusion of litecoin/LTC on major, big money, institutional platforms launching this year, I personally see the first option being much more likely in short term (1-3 years) because you will have litecoin being able to garner much more attention from crypto interested parties than it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term (5-15 years), you could see enough big money flowing into BTC market cap to push the price to $250,000-500,000 and have LTC following, but there is no sign that this kind of money will be coming to crypto in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, the ratio could very well go back to .008 again very directly, but I believe there will eventually be a tipping point where LTC moves back toward .025+ and perhaps, .05 and beyond."

"Hi all!

About one week ago I formatted my SSD because I wanted to install another OS. I had my exodus wallet on this SSD. The exodus wallet was created with the recovery phrase of my ledger nano s, which sadly broke.

I made a few transactions and thought everything I don't transact stays on my ledger. However, (how it looks like for me) exodus always creates a new private key and sends the remaining LTC to this new wallet.

All I could recover with several recovery software solutions was a file calles ""info.seco.lock"", which doesn't seem to help me.

"A bit of jest but also a serious question: how old do you think we will all be when we finally get our Lambos?  I got into crypto (and LTC) just weeks before the Coinbase listing at the very end of 2016.  The funny thing about the ride from that point was that for a total noob I scoffed at all the, ""Wen Moon?"" and ""Lambo,"" posts - but then sure enough the wave surge of 2017 started to build.

And lets not forget that while Charlie never promised us Lambos - he had awesome positive comments, like when we were rocketing up past $100 he was saying that we hadn't even left the launch pad yet.  Those were pretty fun days.

Fast forward to now: The institutional money STILL isn't coming to the table (are they?), Baakt is delaying (indefinitely or it won't make much of an impact right); - so there is no real GAS to throw on the fire.  As far as I can tell it is going to be a long slog in the snow for a while.

I have spoke to their support chat and she said the funds can't be recovered, so I have also made a post on the forum to see if anyone higher up can get involved.

"Nakamoto wanted the LAW of survival of the fittest chain built it into Bitcoin to deal with contentious forks that would arise in the future.  But now I am a bit concerned that his timeline for how these conflicts should play out was a bit more like God's: ""Yeah....so what if it takes, ""a little while,"" for the looser to die off! Be patient, my child.""  

We ""sort of"" got to see how this theory played out six months ago when Bcash forked off.  Unfortunately LACK OF A QUICK AND TOTAL CHAIN DEATH for the looser BCH seems to have taken ALL of crypto into the toilet with it!

Old school bitcoin skeptics have always poo-pooed that the ""air drop,"" of suddenly doubling your crypto holdings into two coins as essentially fractional banking (creating money out of thin air).  BUT, this argument could be countered rather quickly if the process of chain death was very rapid, taking the looser to zero value in just a few weeks or months at most.  TRADERS would have to place there bets quickly, they would have to UNWIND quickly.  AND THE SURVIVOR WOULD PRESUMABLY RE-ESTABLISHING MARKET VALUE QUICKLY.

Many will now say, ""but (minus the quickly part) that is exactly what IS happening you silly boob! Bitcoin has survived YET AGAIN and will strengthen in value (to new ATH?) yet again!  And, perhaps it won't even take more than a few years.""

Ok, fair enough possibly, but back to my point that it is more about how RAPID chain death (call it a duty to quickly kill off the looser) might have saved us from the position we are in now.

Think about it: if a 2017/18 hesitant bitcoin investor (a noob or institutional sidelined investor) would have seen the same bloodbath of the BCH fork BUT A QUICK AND TOTAL BCH DIE OFF AND PRICE RECOVERY OF THE VICTOR BITCOIN, that would have gone a lot further to assuring them that despite crypto being extremely volatile, ""IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO, guess I will wade into crypto a bit."" That is what is needed for mass adoption - not just ease of use.

Every day that BCH survives or claws back a bit of a gain - is just another ""DAY OF CONFUSION,"" for the average sidelined mass adoption person: ""Wait, I was told BCH was supposed to be the NEW bitcoin, or THE BITCOIN, hold on, is the current BTC still Bitcoin??? I thought BCH lost, but it is still alive, why??? Ahh, shit maybe I will just hold off on getting into crypto.""  And Institutional money knows what the average investor thinks about crypto - they will hold off until interests returns.  A QUICK DEATH OF BCH could have purged this kind of outcome.  Yes??? No??? What do people think?

CoinsBank has announced its flagship event, the 4th [Blockchain Cruise, will return in 2019, from June 9th to 13th](https://coinsbank.cruises/?r=1678181). 

The most recent Blockchain Cruise took place from September 7th to 11th, 2018 and provided a unique format for industry professionals to network and foster meaningful partnerships outside of the typical conference setting. The event saw over 2,000 attendees from 58 countries board a luxury vessel to attend presentations by some of the industry’s biggest names, including John McAfee, Bobby Lee, Charlie Lee, Roger Ver, and Brock Pierce, among others. 

The guestlist also included more than 150 media professionals, over 100 venture funds and private investors, 50 presenting companies at the exhibition hall, 200 startups, and experts from all segments of the industry. 

The 2019 Blockchain Cruise by Coinsbank promises to be bigger and better than ever. Departing from Barcelona on June 9th and docking in Rome on June 13th, the global conference will take place on the majestic Oasis of the Seas by Royal Caribbean. Guests will enjoy stops in Palma de Mallorca, Marseille, and La Spezia. 

The vessel boasts seven distinct neighbourhoods, loft suites, the deepest pool on the seas, and never-ending entertainment. While there will be plenty of recreation to go around, the real value is found in the exhibition hall, where more than 70 projects will be presented, the conference, featuring top speakers from the industry, and countless networking events. Each day will be marked by keynote speeches, expert seminars, and game-changing discussions in professional settings. 

«We are very excited to offer this unparalleled networking opportunity for the second time», said Event Coordinator of Coinsbank. «The potential of blockchain can only be realized through an active and supportive community, which is something we aim to foster through the [Blockchain Cruise](https://coinsbank.cruises/?r=1678181)»"

"I've been somewhat interested in crypto currency for a bit and was wondering if its still profitable, and if it is how hard it is to get in to."

"I started mining Litecoin in 2014 until my ASIC broke later that year. I BELIEVE in LTC. It's because I think it's the real deal/has tons potential, that I examine it closely and don't sugar-coat it.

When Charlie announced Litecoin will work towards confidential transactions, the entire crypto space seemed to take notice that it had a ""significant"" use-case. I feel like it gained a bit more respect amongst crypto's leading figures. Shortly after the CT announcement we saw Mike Novogratz throw a fit about LTC, which was notable, since the last time he mentioned it he called it a ""poor man's bitcoin"".

BTC maximalists of all types are always knocking Litecoin because they have deep beliefs that There’s no place for Litecoin in a space where Bitcoin is already the internet’s layer of digital gold. Payments come secondary to a digital store of value / saving mindset. Even Bitcoin originators like Nick Szabo have this belief.

Looking at the top coins, LTC seems to be the most decentralized and fundamentally sound of the cheap/fast coins. I think there's value in being a decentralized cheap/fast coin (even though we're still unclear about this niche will be in the future, since centralized coins do the same thing).

But since all of crypto is basically moving money, it's important not to fall into the Bitcoin Cash tunnel vision of success measured in how fast/cheap we can send money. To have such a focus on payments in a space that is natively about moving money around, might be missing other opportunities for Litecoin. 


I'm confident that Litecoin success will be in new developments / strategic partnerships of respectable projects (like RSK, and Blockstack) and the speed and price at which it moves money, will be secondary to the innovation it will bring. We may need to eventually start funding our own R&amp;D for the blockchain space. This can be done by implementing funding goal meters like Monero has on their website.


If Litecoin focuses more on being leader in research and development (Confidential Trans, development of its lightning network) it will undoubtedly see huge success since its one of the few projects with actual real sound foundations and no fluff."

"Just as the question stated in the title - is LTC still mined from rigs using cpu power as PoW? 

If so, how do you see it fairing in the future as ETH is creating hype around PoS? And would mining LTC be profitable, as we seen mining BTC now done so at a loss."

"There a multiple factors pointing towards Nexo preparing an exit scam.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the last example of them just fooling their investors :

&amp;#x200B;

The 'Nexo Credit Card' was due to be release in July 2018. Fast forward to today: Still no Credit Card as they are 'finalising proposal with partners'. (Please note that they're finalising proposals for over 8 months now!.

&amp;#x200B;

They also claim that : ""Finalizing the deal with **Visa** requires, however, additional time-consuming processes and procedures,...""

&amp;#x200B;

If you take a look on their website and go to the ""Nexo card"" tab, You see a picture of the 'Nexo Card' there with a **Mastercard** logo on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fooling people as long as they can to get that additional cocktail?

Do you still feel safe with your LTC on Nexo?"

"Litecoin (LTC) started Monday at $44.58, not far from the week’s lowest price on Wednesday 27th, at $44.41. Wednesday opened at $45.50 before dropping 2.4% of its value, although it would end up recovering a bit, closing at $45.58, showing a minimal increase of 0.17% that day. Saturday started at $47.48, but a 4.55% increase would push it to $49.64, the week’s high point, before closing at $49.02. Sunday the 3rd started at $49.02 and ended at $48.38, with a 1.31% loss on the day, but a 8.52% gain on the week.

"It seems a lot of projects receive further outreach and attention from partnership announcements and deals. Wouldn't it be a good idea for the longevity of BitShares as an Exchange to connect with other communities and expand its outreach/usage? For example, if another application or business integrated BTS, wouldn't this add significant value to BitShares if that project is able to connect with an entirely different group of users/traders? I know that a lot of people think there is ""competition"" between exchanges &amp; projects, but in my honest opinion I think that it could end up being mutually beneficial to both parties if they're integrated with each other properly.

An article I read from another community that was a good example of a project trying to expand its outreach by integrating different tokens/coins ([https://telegra.ph/Cooperation-01-29](https://telegra.ph/Cooperation-01-29)). Maybe BTS could be next to create a partnership and get integrated? Would be cool to see. What do you guys think?"

"Like many other crypto-enthusiats, I have what I think are awesome ideas for applications that use Litecoin. Of course, my ideas go far beyond my capabilities as I have no idea how to consume the Litecoin API.

Does anybody know of any good tutorials for getting started consuming the Litecoin API?

"Just got this in my email:

&gt; Affected Users:
The purpose of this communication is to provide you with (i) a summary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (the “Court”)’s April 8, 2019 proceeding, and (ii) a warning relating to “phishing” websites that we understand may be targeting Affected Users.

**Summary of Supreme Court of Nova Scotia Proceedings**
On April 8, 2019, Justice Wood heard five motions pertaining to the Quadriga CX Matter:

A motion by Stewart McKelvey LLP to be removed as counsel to the Applicants. This Order was granted.

Three motions by Ernst &amp; Young (the “Monitor”), which pertained to the following issues:

A form of preservation of assets order to freeze the assets of Jennifer Robertson and Gerald Cotton’s estate and certain related companies. The Court granted this order.

Assistance and requested relief with respect to the Third Party Payment Processors. Certain of these Orders were granted and others adjourned to April 18, 2019, which is further discussed below.

The termination of the CCAA Proceedings and a transition into Bankruptcy. This Order was granted.

A motion by Representative Counsel on behalf of the Official Committee of Affected Users regarding fees during the CCAA proceeding and the transition into bankruptcy. This order was granted.

More on the Third Party Payment Processors’ Order:

Concerns were expressed by counsel for certain of the Third Party Processors about the timing of the notice from the Monitor for the Third Party Payment Processors’ Order. These concerns were addressed by the Monitor’s counsel in her submissions. Counsel for the Monitor and the attending Third Party Payment Processors agreed to further discuss the language in the draft orders. If agreements could not be reached as to language changes, Justice Wood stated that he would issue all orders on April 18.

Counsel for POSConnect Inc. consented to provide George Kinsman (from the Monitor) access to POSConnect Inc., subject to certain conditions.

Ms. Pillon also discussed the Monitor’s further efforts to contact and serve various Third Party Payment Processors, such as WB21 and 9133-8079 Quebec Inc. (d/b/a Alto Bureau de Change).

Copies of all of the issued and entered Orders will be available on the Monitor’s website located here.

**“Phishing” Websites**
Representative Counsel has been notified of websites selling asset recovery services to Affected Users. Representative Counsel is not associated with these websites and does not endorse the use of their services. We advise you not to trust any website claiming that they can recover money for Affected Users and requesting your personal information.

Representative Counsel is currently working on a tip sheet to address Affected Users’ privacy concerns, which will be posted to Representative Counsel’s website.

**Additional Information**
The Representative Counsel’s website can be found here.

The Official Committee (@QCXCommittee) can be found on Twitter here.

In consultation with the Official Committee, Representative Counsel has posted an updated FAQ on April 9, 2019 to answer Affected Users’ inquiries as collated by the Official Committee. The updated FAQ can be found here.

Representative Counsel has received from the Monitor a full list of Affected Users, including their contact information and Quadriga CX customer IDs. Any further questions regarding the proceeding can be directed to Representative Counsel at quadrigacx@millerthomson.com."

"Recently, since Litecoin as been running, we have seen alot of ""Litecoin is a useless shitcoin"" fud. I'm gonna try to show why Litecoin is useful: 

1. Security: Litecoin is the second most secure Crypto behind Bitcoin. Why is this the case? High levels of mining Decentralization and Scrypt algorithm.
Having Litecoin run on Scrypt for its hashing algorithm is the ultimate reason why I believe it is the second most secure behind Bitcoin. The way I understand it, having a different algorithm than Bitcoin (SHA256) prevents bitcoin miners from attacking Litecoin. Not only this, but Litecoin has the most hash power against other Scrypt coins. This makes it very very difficult to attack Litecoin. This cannot be said for other Proof of Work coins outside of Bitcoin.

2. Speed/Fees: As I write this, on average transaction fees for a Litecoin transaction is 4 cents and about 2.5 - 5 minutes for a transaction to be considered confirmed. Extremely cheap and fast, it can be shown best by the most recent $99 million transaction with only a $0.40 fee and 2.5 min confirmation time. 

3. Lightning Network and Bitcoin Compatibility: With the invention of LN, Litecoin fees and transaction speeds can be reduced even further. Much of the criticism of Litecoin is it becomes useless since Bitcoin will use LN to increase speed and lower fees. This argument does not mention that Litecoin will also benefit from LN as well. Naturally, Litecoin is the cheapest and fastest on ramp to Lightning Network. What's really cool about the LN though is the compatibility with the two coins. With atomic swaps, you can swap Bitcoin into Litecoin and make a payments much quicker than with Bitcoin alone. The way I see it , Bitcoin is your savings account and Litecoin is a spending account. This is not to say Litecoin is not a good store of value, but Bitcoin is more scarce and more secure making it a stronger store of value to Litecoin, which is more suited for making payments. 

4. The Lindy Effect/Network Effect: Per Wikipedia, ""The Lindy Effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy."" This applies to both Litecoin and Bitcoin. They are the two oldest coins, genisis blocks created in 2011 and 2009 respectively. Both have survived the test of time creating more confidence that it will continue to survive into the future.

Per Wikipedia, ""A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the valueof that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it."" What this means is as the user base/community continues to grow, it becomes easier for it grow further. Litecoin has grown a massive community over its 7 and half year existence staying a top crypto since the beginning, making its future growth easier. 

In Summary: Litecoin is the second most secure, second oldest cryptocurrency designed for payments and to complement Bitcoin, not compete with it. The speed to security ratio stands out from other PoW coins and is only second to Bitcoin. The longevity and strong community of Liteocin increases the likelihood it will survive into the future and with the use of Lightning Network, Litecoin can complement Bitcoin even further. Obviously there are other properties that make Litecoin a strong cryptocurrency, but these in my opinion are the more important ones.

Let me know if I stated anything factually inaccurate or have varying opinions, thanks !"

"Hey LF and Charlie - I came up with this idea in another reply - and I think the ""sell it in one word hook"" is incredible: ""Starlites"" really should be the ""marketing java name,"" of Litecoin used at Starbucks!  There is no way Starbuck's can't admit that this would be a great name for a ""unit of purchase,"" in their stores.

But how can we get our foot in the door now or get Starbuck's corporate interested when they have already said that they are not quite ready for crypto yet (remember however that they have shown strong interest in crypto being introduced in their stores)?  

Well I lived near the Madison test Starbuck's in Seattle a few years back - and they try everything out there early. This is where they experimented with late night booze offerings. So instead of selling them on TAKING Litecoin cold turkey, FLIP it around and maybe find a way to get them to DONATE a fractions of a Litecoin (aka ""STARLITES"") to their or their customers selected charities! 

""Would you like part of your latte purchase to go towards purchasing a STARLITE for charity X?"" This gets people who don't even know about crypto or don't want to invest in it to say, ""sure, why not? btw what is a Litecoin?"" AND! AND!! It lays a ""first cypto foot in the door foundation"" with Starbucks.  And maybe, just maybe, when Starbuck's is ready to accept crypto for purchases Litecoin will already be first in line on their list."

"Hey Reddit,

Story time!  So a few weeks back, on this very sub, u/Ignignokt_7 made the comment ""[Will trade 1 LTC for cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/a49muk/we_are_now_so_low_i_am_considering_bulk_buying/ebcpefv/).""  I half-jokingly offered to have my wife bake one for him in exchange for the coin and shipping costs.  It would be a great real-world transaction, not just a trade for investment.

Well, after sitting on the idea for a while and then deciding it wasn't worth the trouble of shipping a delicate baked-good, Ignignokt\_7 said he would pay my wife the coin if she baked the cake, shared it with someone else, and told them it was from a crypto enthusiast as a pay-it-forward way to spread cheer in the new year.  His stipulation, of course, was that i had to help her establish her own wallet and send him pics as proof.  I was happy to do so since this was a way to get her more interested in crypto!  Usually her eyes glaze over in boredom when I start talking about blockchain, haha...

My wife decided to share the cake with the other staff in the medical office where she works.  I think she may be the only new crypto wallet holder out of this endeavor, but she said a few people told her they loved the cake and the reason why she made it for them.  Per her request, here what I wrote for her to include with the cake:

&gt;In a discussion on Reddit, I saw a Cryptocurrency enthusiast say he’d like to buy a Lemon Cake with his digital money.  I half-jokingly told him, “my wife makes a great Lemon Cake!” and offered to sell him one.  Long story short, he didn’t want to go to the trouble of having it shipped but offered to pay her one Litecoin (USD value approximately $30) to bake the cake and share it with others to spread cheer in the New Year.  So please enjoy!

"[Crowdfund Campaign](https://www.israelcasillasjr.com/)

* I have provided all information in a TL;DR like format for easy consumption

Over the past year+ I have spent my spare time developing web services for various cryptocurrency teams. The services that attract the most interest from cryptocurrency teams are:

* BuyPivx: Pay in fiat using paypal or stripe, receive PIVX sent directly to your wallet address
* CryptoFeed: Real time cryptocurrency prices, historical charts, market cap, and social media data
* CoinSwap: Swap one cryptocurrency for another, no registration or KYC required

While developing services for various teams I traveled further down the rabbit hole and realized most cryptocurrencies provide enough functionality to replace many online payment processors ( middle men ) but there are very few applications utilizing the potential.

I am now attempting to crowdfund the development of multiple services in exchange for open sourcing everything. ( see “Services” tab on “Crowdfund Campaign” for more information )

* When I begin the development of a new service it will be open sourced from the start to show the progress being made throughout development.
* I intend to accept feedback and take requests from the beginning

My goals are simple

* Free up enough time from my full time job to work on these services
* Develop each service in a way that accepts nearly any cryptocurrency
* Provide startup(s) and cryptocurrency team(s)  a set of services/utilities that can be launched with a set of installation instructions ( will be included in each README.md )
* Help increase adoption of cryptocurrencies
* **Finally** begin the transition into developing cryptocurrency services full time

This time around

* I have several utilities prebuilt
* I am building multiple utilities that will provide value for the industry as a whole
* **Everything** will be **open sourced** from start to finish

Finally

* If you’re unable to donate but wish to help out please share on social media, etc. I appreciate all the help I can get.
* If you have any feedback I am looking for 100% brutally honest criticism do not hold back."



Are there any detailed plan how to implement MW to Litecoin? As I understand this requires creation of second blockchain storing MW transaction. Is there any idea how to move LTCs from old blockchain to mw-one and vice versa?

"So you are ready to buy your first crypto. Wondering how to store your coins? With so many crypto wallets out there it can be very tricky to decide where exactly to keep your digital currency, right? But here we are – an incredibly friendly [Stealthex](https://stealthex.io/) team – to guide and help you realize which type of wallet is just right for you.

Let’s start with some basics. **What is a cryptocurrency wallet?** In simple terms, it is a kind of a digital equivalent of a bank account that allows you to store, send and receive digital coins. The main feature is that crypto wallets have two important components: a public key and a private key. The ***public key*** is a wallet address to which anyone can send you coins. The ***private key*** is both a login and a password used to access your currency.

The other feature of crypto wallets is the fact that they don’t actually store currency in any physical form. And when someone sends you crypto, they are essentially signing off ownership of their coins to the address of your wallet. The transaction is confirmed by a record on the blockchain and a change in a balance in your crypto wallet.

There are different classifications of wallets. Let’s go through **the main types and features of digital wallets**.

**1. Classification by type of access to the wallet:**

* *Hot wallets*. These ones have access to the Internet and a blockchain in particular. They are considered ‘hot’ because of the greater ability for activity and accessibility. Just like cash in your pocket.

Pros: can help you make transactions in the blink of an eye, user-friendly.

Cons: security risks.

* *Cold wallets.* These are stored offline most of the time. Cold wallets are some kind of a safe where you can store a great number of digital coins for a long time.

Pros: high level of security.

Cons: not easy to access, low speed.

**2. Classification by wallet’s “weight”:**

* *Heavy wallets*. Require downloading the entire blockchain, which will later be stored on a computer occupying a significant place on your hard disk.

Pros: no risks of transferring personal information over the network.

Cons:  risk of getting a virus on your computer, usage inconvenience.                                           

* *Light wallets.* These ones access the blockchain via third-party services and therefore do not require downloading and storing the entire blockchain on a computer.

Pros: independence – you can choose which service to use, very easy to handle.

Cons: risk of hackers attack.

**3. Classification by the ways of private key storage:**

* *Desktop wallets*. These are downloaded and installed on your computer which gives you some security as you are unable to access this wallet from anywhere else aside from the actual desktop.

Pros: good security level, convenience, a great choice of wallets, free downloads.

Cons: risk of computer viruses and hacker attacks.

Examples: Exodus, Bitcoin Core.

* *Mobile wallets.* Run as an app on your phone, storing your private keys and allowing you to make transactions directly from your phone.

Pros: simple, very handy, free downloads.

Cons: risk of hacking, losing or damaging your phone which will lead to problems with access to your crypto.

Examples: Xapo, Coinomi.

* *Online wallets*. These run on a cloud service owned by a third party. In this case, the private keys are located on remote servers. This type of wallet allows users not only to open several addresses for different cryptocurrencies but also to trade on exchanges, estimate commissions using the built-in calculator and so on.

Pros: easy to use, able to work with multiple cryptocurrencies, high transaction speed.

Cons: security risks, additional expenses such a commission to the service.

Examples: HolyTransaction, Coinbase.

* *Hardware wallets*. The transactions are made online, but the private key is stored offline on a USB stick or a specially designed piece of hardware. These wallets can be considered as cold wallets until they are offline.

Pros: very high level of security, easy to set up and use.

Cons: expensive ($150-200), inconvenient if you need fast access to your coins.

Examples:  KeepKey, Trezor.

* *Paper wallets*. A unique storage option representing a printed QR-code containing a public address and a private key. It is a super cold wallet. Great option for long-term storage for those who do not trust gadgetry.

Pros: highest level of security.

Cons:  risk of destruction or loss of paper that contains wallet info, totally not for beginners.

Example: bitaddress.org.

As you can see there is no such thing as the best crypto wallet. The right wallet for you will be the one that matches your needs and the purpose of your cryptocurrency savings.

"Hi

I had an old Andriod Litecoion wallet and exported the wallet keys before getting rid of the old tablet.

* The export is named (and dated) litecoin-wallet-keys-2014-03-07....

* If it's password protected I'm sure I can remember the passcode.

I have downloaded the dekstop Litecoin Core wallet and after a sync I tried to import importprivkey but I get:

\### Welcome to /r/Litecoin!

 

(Re-post of u/Sparkswont cuz it was archived)

&amp;#x200B;

Whether you're new to cryptocurrency and have no clue what a 'litecoin' is, or a seasoned investor in cryptocurrencies, the resources below will answer all your questions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask below in the comments!

 

\&amp;nbsp;

 

\##What is Litecoin?

 

Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin is one of the largest, oldest, and most used cryptocurrencies in the world. Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin uses blockchain technology to process transactions.

 

So what's the difference? To process a block, Litecoin takes 2.5 minutes rather than Bitcoins 10 minutes. This allows for faster processing times. Litecoin also has the capability to produce a total of 84 million units, compared to Bitcoins 21 million. In addition, Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm, a sequential memory-hard function requiring asymptotically more memory than an algorithm which is not memory-hard.

 

Still confused? Take a look at \[this video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0buY7giI3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0buY7giI3o))!

 

\&amp;nbsp;

 

\##Where can I buy Litecoin?

 

There are many websites and applications where you can buy and sell Litecoin, but make sure the exchange you are using is trusted and secure. Here are some exchanges that are trusted in the cryptocurrency community:

 

| Exchange |

|:--|

|\[Coinbase\]([https://www.coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com)) \*USD/Euro/GBP\*|

|\[Bithump\]([https://www.bithumb.com/](https://www.bithumb.com/)) \*KRW\*|

|\[OKCoin\]([https://www.okcoin.com/](https://www.okcoin.com/)) \*Euro/Yen/USD\*|

|\[OKex\]([https://www.okex.com/](https://www.okex.com/)) \*CNY\* |

|\[[Btcmarkets.net](https://Btcmarkets.net)\]([https://www.btcmarkets.net/](https://www.btcmarkets.net/)) \*AUD\* |

|\[Bitso\]([https://bitso.com/](https://bitso.com/)) \*MXN\* |

|\[Zebpay\]([https://www.zebpay.com/](https://www.zebpay.com/)) \*INR\* |

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

 

\##Where can I securely store Litecoin?

 

Litecoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is stored in a digital wallet. When storing Litecoin, you want to make sure you trust the place you store them. This is why it is best to store them yourself through the \[electrum wallet\]([https://electrum-ltc.org/](https://electrum-ltc.org/)). It is highly suggested to not store your Litecoin in an exchange (such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc.) because you don't control the private keys. If the exchange ever goes offline, or becomes insolvent, your Litecoin essentially disappear.

 

Some other options are:

\[Electrum Lightweight Wallet\]([https://electrum-ltc.org/](https://electrum-ltc.org/))|

\[Official Core Wallet\]([https://litecoin.org/#download](https://litecoin.org/#download))|

\[LiteVault Secure Web Wallet\]([https://www.litevault.net/](https://www.litevault.net/))|

If you're a fan of mobile devices, then \[Loafwallet\]([http://loafwallet.org/](http://loafwallet.org/)) is the wallet for you. Developed by a Litecoin Foundation Dev, /u/losh11, this mobile wallet works great!  And remember to always make sure to \*\*write down your seedkeys.\*\*

 

\&amp;nbsp;

 

Hardware wallets are another great option, in fact, they are said to be the most secure way to store cryptocurrencies. Below is a list of the litecoin flexible hardware wallets.

\&amp;nbsp;

 

\##Where can I spend Litecoin?

 

Litecoin is in the \[top ten of all cryptocurrencies\]([https://coinmarketcap.com/](https://coinmarketcap.com/)) by market capitalization. Websites are rapidly adopting Litecoin as a method of payment as well.  If you yourself want to accept LTC as a business, you can refer to these \[merchant manuals\]([https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/merchants/home](https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/merchants/home)).  Alternatively, if you would like to explore websites that accept Litecoin, head over to /r/AcceptingLTC.

 

Here are also several of our \[favorite merchants\]([http://www.uselitecoin.info/](http://www.uselitecoin.info/)) accepting Litecoin.

 

\&amp;nbsp;

 

\##Where can I discuss Litecoin?

 

The Litecoin community is extremely kind and robust. There are many forums and places where you can discuss Litecoin with others who are interested in the currency. Here are the main ones:

 

Platform|

:--|:--

\[Reddit\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/))|

"Dogecape Version 0.0.3

Main idea:

Dogecape will be an MMORPG game that will completely free to play! Players will be able to explore the world and complete quests to earn Doge, The in-game currency. Players will also be able to go on horde runs.

MMORPG Economy:

On the mmorpg portation of the game people can go on Dogecape and complete quests to earn certain items. Players can also grind/find material to create new items. Players can sell these items to other players. The game doesn’t set a defined cost/sell the price for an item that is defined by the player base. For example, let say you found a diamond skull which is a 1 out of 56,890 chances of finding. You try to sell it for 50,000 Doge, but the market price is 23,000 Doge. You can hold to your diamond skull until market value increases and then sell it. We will make it so you can sell your ingame items on a secure website for usd or accepted cryptocurrencies. Only accepted crypto so far is dogecoin and Litecoin. \[[Dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com/)\]

Quests: 

Quests will be a long or arduous search for something. Quest awards will be a various amount of items. Harder quest will earn rarer items and the lowest more common items. An example of a quest is, “Mine 1000 stone.” which you may get 5 doge and stone skull.

Converting

The ingame currency doge will be worth: 

* $1 = 1000 doge
* 530 Dogecoin = 1000 doge
* 0.00841866 Ether = 1000 doge \[Soon will be added\]
* 0.02143906 Lite = 1000 doge

Horde run

If your bored with grinding and quests you can do horde runs. Horde runs is an arcade style combat with waves of enemies. Up to four players can join together to fight against 50(editable if you want) waves of the Horde. The difficulty increases as the players advance through the waves. Horde can be played on any multiplayer map.

"A few years back, it took me a while but I got used to Microsoft's new logo look - the simplified window pane design of four silver (or colored) straight edge blocks.  It's almost hard to remember now the old wavy window image - almost more of a flag of colors waving in the wind.  Looking back now it was soooo big hair 1980s.

I think I see the Litecoin foundation moving the Litecoin logo towards the simplicity image - and I DO think this is GOOD and the RIGHT way to go!  Getting away from the British Pound look, or having the world's continents in the background is indeed kind of like the move Microsoft did with it's logo. 

BUT, there is such a thing as hitting the sweet spot with a logo design - and I don't think you should ever quit until you get it just right. The most recent LF endorsed Litecoin logos are 97 to 98% on target in my opinion.

With the exception of the new MUCH skinnier L in the middle of the circle.  If you get it too thinned down it get's harder to see on a UFC matt - and thinned down isn't a great subliminal message as far as branding goes.

The other feature to be aware of is color.  I think UFC guys like SILVER, I think they like BLACK, and they probably like BLUE too as long as it isn't a dull or pastel-ish blue.  

I guess what I am saying with the new logo is that it is dead on what it should be - but it just needs to be ever sol slightly SHARPENED up; BOLDENED up; and VIVIDED up (whatever color / just commit to that color so it jumps off the matt or a T-shirt just a bit more).  I say this because I think going forward with UFC exposure crowd you have to think about how they will look at the logo too (not just corporate look)."
