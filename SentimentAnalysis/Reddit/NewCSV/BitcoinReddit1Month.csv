"I'm just wondering if anyone can recommend a good article or ebook that runs through both the underlying mathematics behind Bitcoin and the current infrastructure (exchanges, transactions, tumbling, etc) that supports it. I'm looking for something that is geared towards someone who's mathematical background is that of a graduate level electrical engineer. It seems a lot of the literature is geared toward those with less technical and mathematical background.

Even Elon Musk sees the energy usage of mining as a major problem to its future. But my understanding is that bitcoin mining is part of managing the ledger so is mining necessary at certain levels and wasteful at other levels? Could a coin be developed that make mining nearly worthless pass the point necessary for managing transactions?

"Hey,

First of all:
I'm using 2 Ledger Nano S, both are using the newest Firmware plus i use the mobile Ledger Live App on my iPhone to check my account balance.

I have the following issue:

I'm using the Ledger Nano S more than one year and everything was working fine untill today.

I wanted to transfer Litecoins to a new Litecoin Wallet onto my Nano S, which i created via Ledger Live Desktop App. I double checked the adresses and filled the via copy &amp; paste in Coinbase to transfer the Litecoins.
After a couple of minutes i checked my iPhone and the account balance was showing the correct amount of Litecoins...so far so good.
Then i checked my Desktop Ledger Live app, and there was no new transfer listed - the new created Litecoin Account shows me 0 LTC. Back to my iPhone: Everything was fine.
Then i cleared the Cache - nothing better...Then i deleted the account, and wanted to re-add the account: Shock! Only old Accounts listed, but not the Account, to which i transfered my Litecoins. After that i configured my backup Nano S from the Seed, made a Firmware Update and checked again - opened Ledger Live and wanted to add a Litecoin Account: the account was not listet.
Meanwhile the account on my iPhone still shows me the correct amount of LTC on the correct account.

What can i do?? It seems, that the account was not properly saved on the Ledger respectively the Ledger Seed. "

"Hi guys,  


A lot of people used to reffer to the volume to put in evidence the last step of a bubble burst: the capitulation.  


However, it's seems that volume is not the only indicators of that phenomenon.  


I have decided to show you the Bitcoin volatility index (in the white box) of BTC 60-days.  
You can cleary see, in the 2014 crash, the two peak of the volatility index. The first is from the 2014 ATH, and the second is from the capitulation later in 2015.  


If we look at this index during the last bubble, we can also see a strong peak in the volatility index during the big FOMO when BTC has reached 20k. Then the next big volatility peak was during the crash from 6k to 3k. Now volatility index is very low.  


I think it's pretty normal that the volatily in 2014 was able to reach such height, because the market was still very very light in term of capitalisation. Years later in 2018, market was slightly bigger and the volatility is harder to reach such level.   


From this analysis I could conclude that the pattern is pretty similar and makes me think that we may have reached a bottom.   


It's just my point of view! Maybe we will see in the coming month one more dip with volume. But i'm not so sure.   


What do you guys think of my analysis ?  
(hope my english is not so bad, not my first language sorry)

"Hey Bitcoin fam! I am new to the crypto market and have immediately encountered  frustrating obstacles. 

At the end of last month I made an account with Coinbase and Abra. After a week of having Abra linked to my bank account I was unable to add funds or use the app at all (“Your wallet is not enabled for this transaction”). I emailed customer support and they would tell me NOTHING (due to privacy agreement). Fast forward two weeks and they still wont to tell me anything other than I am not able to use the service for anything other that transferring funds.

Coinbase let me make an initial purchase but after that initial purchase I was unable to purchase anything else or fund my account at all. Customer support at Coinbase only tells me that I have reached my purchasing limit (didn’t even buy remotely  large amount) and that I can request a limit increase in 30 days.

I’m wondering if anybody else has had issues like mine. My first thought is that my bank is throttling me but I’m not sure. Can anyone please shed some light with an opinion on what my issue is. 

Thanks"

Now all the media saying POW is a waste of electricity, well in bcash it basically is. This is the thing in bcash that is fundamentally different from bitcoin.

&gt; To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof of-work system

Bitcoin: uses POW for decentralized consensus

"(Sorry, this is the second time I post this... Still a noob at Reddit...) 

Hi,

I would like to share a personal experience I had with my bank today. 

I was expecting since December a payment income from a company I usually work with. They are a very reliable client and normally I do not have any problems to get my invoices payed. 

I was waiting for a payment from December, January and February and it didn't arrive to my bank account. 

I called the company several times and they where telling me that the payment was done but they had to look into it with the financial department. So I waited. I was busy the last month and was not really checking my account very often... But when I did I got really upset. 

Today I called them very pissed of, telling them that they have to pay me. I was really annoyed about the situation. I got the guy on the phone who deals with my invoices (finally) and he told me that he has a report that the payment was done on time and that my bank rejected the incoming money. WTF??? 

So I called my bank and they said that it is true. They rejected ALL incoming money because they needed some paperwork (tax related). I asked them why they freeze my account without being notified and they answer that they did by post letter, which by the way I never received.(no mention on the online banking either). 

This was really embarrassing calling back the client company a needed to apologize that they did nothing wrong and that my bank decided by themselves that no money goes into my account. 

This client is a really good one and I accused them not paying me on time. These days you have to treat good clients properly and because of my bank now I needed to apologize to a good customer. 

With BTC this could not happen... Hope one day everyone use it.

It seems to me that a couple of alt coins tend to have big upswings when they get in danger of slipping a notch among the marketcaps of all coins. Like bcash is only slightly above Tether but I believe the price movement suggests it is very important to them to stay above it simply because it being number N is better than N+1. I think Litecoin moving about bcash was a big deal for both alts.

"# Reaching the Masses: Blockchains Rollercoaster Journey

&amp;#x200B;

![img](y8mtq86qf1j21)

&amp;#x200B;

A 40 Million Dollar Pizza

&amp;#x200B;

On November 1st, 2008, Nakamoto published a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. Just two months later, on January 3rd, 2009, he (or she, or a group of shes and hes) began mining the first block of the chain, known as the Genesis block. The 6 day process was rewarded with 50BTC — valued at nearly 1,000,000USD during Bitcoin’s 2017 climax. Not bad for a week of work. Since then, the world has marked ten years mining — often accompanied with the thrill of major gains and subsequent fist clenching losses.

&amp;#x200B;

More than a year and a half later on May 22nd, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz was able to strike a deal trading 10,000BTC for $25 worth of Papa Johns. Hence dubbed Bitcoin Pizza Day, the day is not only significant because it marks probably the only time someone has ever spent tens of millions of dollars on a single dinner (albeit with a few leftovers), but it also marks the first real-world commercial transaction powered by Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bitcoin is a fad

&amp;#x200B;

So far, the industry has faced its ups and downs. Every climax has been accompanied by technological breakthroughs and innovation in algorithms. Each ebb has been characterised by the lack of practical use cases, bad press, or regulation troubles.

&amp;#x200B;

Key points on this rollercoaster include blockchain being ignored, misunderstood, outright taboo, strictly controlled, and finally accepted, imitated, and flourishing. Where we currently lie on the journey isn’t known — but what is known, however, is that blockchain missionaries will keep pushing the word of decentralization.

&amp;#x200B;

At first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, and finally you win. — Gandhi

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](hum3bmdqf1j21)

# Where in the technology are we now?

&amp;#x200B;

So far, there have been two concrete eras of blockchain. Dial up and fibre-optic, flip phone and that computer in your pocket — make any comparison you want, advances have been plenty.

&amp;#x200B;

# Blockchain Era 1.0: Bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

The first generation of blockchain is represented by Bitcoin. It’s currently the most well known blockchain in existence — even if someone doesn’t know what a blockchain is, odds are, they’ve heard of Bitcoin. However, the mechanism that powers Bitcoin and makes the transfer of value possible doesn’t get as much attention. Bitcoin depends on a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to verify blocks and mine coins. It is currently only used to transfer value from peer to peer and cannot support other uses. When you hear about someone pushing blockchain for business or personal uses, this isn’t the one.

&amp;#x200B;

# Blockchain Era 2.0: Ethereum

&amp;#x200B;

The second generation of blockchain is represented by the advances made by Ethereum. From this point on, the uses of blockchain have been diversified greatly. Ethereum provided smart contracts and the EVM, which showed that applications could be linked to the blockchain. The ICO and rise of ERC20 tokens is thought to have pushed the price of BTC to an all time high of nearly 20,000USD, but still, we’re not where we need to be if blockchain is going to be a practical tool for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

However, due to the increased amount of ICO’s taking place in 2017, currency bubbles, and overall attention garnered, the blockchain space caught the eye of many governments. Supervision of ICOs and various powerful regulations where put in place to control the finances going in. Advances started to cool, attention waned off, and before we knew it, the Crypto Winter was upon us.

&amp;#x200B;

Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux, and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected. — George Soros

&amp;#x200B;

# Blockchain Era 3.0: Thank you, Next.

&amp;#x200B;

We find ourselves increasing TPS speeds into the tens of thousands and higher, focusing on ecological community governance, ending centralisation, and bettering the economic model for incubating various decentralised Apps.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple consensus mechanisms and technical architectures have emerged, such as Proof-of-Stake and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. IOTA uses DAG directed acyclic graph architecture, NEO and Ruibo adopt Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms, and more. However, breaking through the speed bottleneck while also remaining decentralized remains an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 gave us many “firsts” in the public chain sphere, all competing for the next round of bull market leaders — but the issues have not been solved.

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of 2018, about forty or fifty public chain projects were launched, most concentrating on DAG architecture of Sharding segmentation technology. There projects were highly anticipated by investors, but at present, nothing has come out of them, which has exacerbated the current disappointment that is the Crypto Winter. Chains still suffer from centralization, slow speeds, and no sustainable vision. The race to get to the top has left many breathing thin air, with no supplies to set up camp. Nothing to build a future on, nothing to build communities.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

![img](dav0smdqf1j21)

# Bitconch: bringing the warmth of Spring to the harsh Crypto Winter

&amp;#x200B;

Bitconch has offered a solution to the issues still plaguing the blockchain world. The approach uses the Proof-of-Reputation (PoR) consensus algorithm in which a quantified reputation (Bit-R) is created using three dimensions — user socialization, currency holding time, and computing power contribution.

&amp;#x200B;

The parallel processing architecture know as BLAZE (Bitconch Ledger Access Zero-delay Extension) and a random selection of 30 to 500 verifying nodes, pushes TPS to more than 100,000, a hundred times faster than competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the nature of the chain, it serves as an efficient platform for combating centralization, increasing speeds, and allowing all upstanding members of the community to play an equal part — not just those who have all of the resources as seen in previous chains.

&amp;#x200B;

Through solving the problems holding blockchain back, Bitconch is able to provide decentralised applications with a more practical and conscientious solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitconch, Proof-of-Reputation, &amp; BLAZE — bringing an end to the Crypto Winter."

"As most of you probably know Ledger Nano S while providing some very decent security, lacks several important features in its LedgerLive app, namely - ability to to use your own full node for syncing up the transactions, ability to view utxos and control which ones get spent (like you can in Electrum) - to name a few. 

Many users are now aware that they can actually setup an Electrum-based wallet while still using Ledger for transaction signing. However, not many realize they can actually migrate their existing bitcoin wallets that they see on LedgerLive app to Electrum. It requires a few jumps through the hoops - but is rewarding in the end. 

My set up was as follows - I had a legacy Bitcoin and a segwit-enabled wallet. I was able to migrate them both to Electrum, so I could control any subsequent tx's with Ledger from Electrum. I was also able to import all existing  transactions and thus have fine-grained control over transactions. This last step involved setting up Electrum Personal Server.


If there is enough interest in this process, I will put together a guide and post a link. Let me know in the comments if there is enough interest."

"""This brings up the question of what a good price for Bitcoin would be. When will Bitcoin stabilize? It should become less volatile as it becomes more widely adopted because it will be harder for local events and individual people to affect the price very much, right?

Not necessarily. Although perhaps we will see less wild daily swings, I think Bitcoin is unlikely to ever attain anything like a stable price. If Bitcoin’s price were stable, this would mean that it had achieved an equilibrium with the other currencies. There would have to be some sweet spot at which there is exactly the right balance of bitcoins and dollars. When Bitcoin’s price went a little bit too high, people would start to sell for dollars, and when it went a little bit too low, people would buy more bitcoins.

To anyone who thinks this is possible, I ask why would any equilibrium happen? What would it possibly mean for Bitcoin’s price to be too high? Unlike just about anything else, a higher price for Bitcoin does not reduce its usefulness one bit. One simply trades in smaller amounts of it. In fact, a higher price makes Bitcoin more useful because a higher price indicates that more people want to buy, which means that Bitcoin’s liquidity grows, which makes it more useful as a currency.

Therefore, I would suggest that we should never expect an equilibrium between bitcoins and dollars or any other currencies. Instead, Bitcoin should show a pattern of hypermonetization. It will become more and more valuable at a faster and faster rate priced in terms of other currencies. Its price chart should show an asymptotic increase that approaches infinity after a finite time.

Bitcoin may stabilize in terms of real goods, but I see no reason to think that it will stabilize in terms of other currencies. Once Bitcoin starts killing the other currencies, it will still be volatile, and this will still be an indication of its success.

If my prediction is wrong and Bitcoin ever stops being volatile, that might be a good time to dump it.""

"Hey guys,

I'm trying to set up my own node on a Raspberry pi. I have gotten as far as synchronizing the block chain. However, on my display my IP is now displayed in red and I only have 8 peers. I have read up and found out that my node can't be reached from the outside since port 8333 isn't open.

So I went to my Fritz!Box and tried to activate port forwarding.

Now, here's my problem. I choose the device I wanna forward to, specify port 8333 and choose a protocol. However, even when I speficially make the pi reachable and visible to the outside, I don't seem to be able to connect to it when I use port checker websites. Am I missing anything here? I don't know enough to fix this on my own so any help regarding additional steps that I have missed are greatly appreciated.

I've got a sister traveling in Ireland for several months. She needs some money. She has been using N26 debit card while abroad. Can I add her N26 account to my Coinbase and withdraw from Coinbase too her N26 account? How does the currency exchange work (US dollars too whatever N26 uses?) Has anyone had issues doing this? Edit: Also are there fees doing this?





I know little about the futures market. Basically I read that the futures markets will prevent another 2017 style bull run by allowing speculators to bet against it. thoughts?

"Didn't the Truecrypt dev disappeared at similar time as Satoshi? both projects are cryptographic programs with an anonymous dev, Truecrypt was the best encrypting program that was impossible to crack."
"For the sake of discussion I’ll ask the question. If you had to invest your life savings in one of these two coins, which would be, Facebook Coin or Bitcoin? This is an even a competition in my mind."
"So this is a story with multiple incidents. The reason i tell it is to warn other users and the fact that their funds might not be safe any longer.

1. **Internal HACK**  
My email was changed from within okex, and no ID was asked, no mail from support, no nothing.. That field has no change button on it so if possible it had to be done with special request. Okex could not provide any email or evidence that proved they received such a request. \~12 BTC were transferred off. After many mails in which they tried to convince me i changed it (although it is not freaggin possible) they gave me back \~90% of lost funds.. As i was talking with walls i decided to take what they offered. 
2. **Enabling 2FA on accounts without it by force**  
After being internally hacked and not admitting it they changed their internal policy and blocked all accounts that did not have 2FA leaving users with open trades and no access to accounts. This happened to me. I had a stupid long position open that was heading towards liquidation.   
I sent an email asking them to remove the 2FA urgently so i can manage my position on 14 DEC. They sent the request further and asked me for:  
 

We need to confirm it, you want to remove 2fa from okcoin account, right? If yes.

We can remove 2FA for you, please send those information :

Surname (Last name):  
given name (first and middle names):   
Former name(s)/Alias (if application):   
Date of birth:   
Nationality:   
Name (in local language):   
Passport number:  
Current living address information:

Offline level-2 documents required:  
1- International Passport photo.  
2- Address proof document (ID or Driver's license or Bank statement or Utility bill with your current living address which is issued within 3 months in English)  
After that, please finish video verification by skype.  
May your account or withdrawal will be frozen according to the safety rule.

&amp;#x200B;

* So after enabling my accounts 2FA, they wanted level 2 verification as well. I complied and sent them all the data in the hope that i can get access to my account to manage my position. No no on. They have the audacity to actually make me wait another 72 hours for something i did not do with the risk of me losing my position!! I was outraged.   
 

thanks for your understanding and cooperation during the process.

For security concerns, we need to freeze the account  first for 72 hours. Please provide this code: 6996ED after 72 hours, we will remove the GA at that time.

For withdrawal, we will enable it after you finish level 2 verification online.

&amp;#x200B;

* Account was restored after 72 hours with all my level 2 verification deleted... which i had to redo! (no prior announcement or anything to let me know this was going to happen)

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Tried deleting my account (yeah right!)**

&amp;#x200B;

So i decided to leave and asked them to delete my account. That is not possible apparently. You can only freeze it.. so they have your entire history and personal information which you have no say over. But this is not the worst if you can believe it or not:

* sent them an email from a different address of mine that had nothing to do with the account and asked them to delete it. A few hours later it was suspended no questions asked as of who is this new email.
* Then i noticed and asked them to unfreeze the account so i can change some information in it that is bogus if they **can't** delete the account. I received this answer:

  

[The Lie](https://i.redd.it/tz8touvre2n21.png)

* 16 Hours later still blocked and they again have the audacity to ask for a skype call and all that other BS [https://i.imgur.com/xzqUV8A.png](https://i.imgur.com/xzqUV8A.png) 
* They refused to answer me why they blocked my account from a different mail then the one registered. 
* They sent me a personal mail to my registered address hoping i won't noticed they changed it because they effed up!
* After getting a support specialist on the line that was ready to explain to me how come i was able to block my account from a bogus email but not unblock it?! they cut the chat to the whole site =))))))

&amp;#x200B;

I\`m not making this stuff up, but believe me i wish i would.. I spent many years on okex even before it was independent and the level of lies and unprofessionality i witnessed here is at another level. 

Maybe i\`m alone in this, in which case i constantly just get unlucky, or it's been happening for a while but again ppl will ignore it until it's to late. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers guys, happy trading! :D"

"**TL;DR for people that already know this bot:** it now posts shorter comments that are easier to understand, and dumps the full detailed user summaries in a separate post in its own subreddit. This makes it less spammy and more useful in comments sections.

**Quick links**: [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptochecker/comments/ascogw/faq_about_ucryptochecker_2019/), [Usage](https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptochecker/comments/atbifk/how_to_use_ucryptochecker/), [List of included subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptochecker/comments/ascn8q/list_of_cryptocurrency_subreddits_updated_2019/).

***

# What's u/cryptochecker?

It's a bot designed to provide information and transparency to the communities across Reddit that are interested in cryptocurrencies. It offers 2 services:

1. Providing short summaries of the cryptocurrency subreddits in which a user has been most active, in order to help other users estimate where their biases may lie.

2. Providing information and links to CoinMarketCap for any token requested.

# What's in a user summary?

This bot provides a quick overview of the crypto subreddits that a user posts in the most often, as well as their total and average karma for those posts. It will also show the average sentiment of those posts (more explanation of ""sentiment"" [here](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html)). It also links to a longer more detailed summary in its own subreddit, r/cryptochecker. This is to avoid taking up too much space in comments sections with the full results.

# What coin info can the bot get?

This bot provides a table of key data on cryptocurrencies when their symbols are supplied. This table can be sorted by any column, like any other Reddit table.

# Usage:

**To request a user check:** reply to any comment or post they the user has made with `u/cryptochecker` and nothing else. Alternatively, in the body of a comment replying to the user's comment or post, include `u/cryptochecker check`.

**To request coin info:** put `u/cryptochecker info` somewhere in your comment, followed by some coin names, e.g. `u/cryptochecker info BTC eth BCH` will give information on BTC, ETH and BCH.

"  

Hello, as the title says, I am looking for people interested in participating in a puzzle (challenge) and solving it together. The people I need for the challenge must be perseverant and understand that every success requires a failure many times, it will be a **difficult** challenge and that is why I look for a team, it must be people: honest, perseverant, wanting to have fun solving the challenge and who are willing to sacrifice as much time as possible to solve the challenge, self-confident people who do not give up. (I am looking for people who have knowledge in cryptography, computer science, mathematics, (with luck, programming in python or some scripting language, it is not absolutely necessary), enigmas, with a lot of creativity and determined to win). the challenge has a great prize if we win. For more information, tell me by dm, only for people really interested. Thank you! (If it is published in the bitcoin thread, it is because the challenge is related to bitcoin). P.S: I'm not the creator of the challenge, I'm just looking for people who want to participate with me."


"If it was just some other company, I’d say they are exit scammers. But if they are connected with Gemini / Winklevossī, they might be not. Alright.

But my problem is - why, or rather why now? Did crypto lending got so massive, that they don’t have enough of their own BTC to lend anymore? I mean - if they aren’t scammers, shouldn’t they primarily use their own funds? Does it mean they already ran out? Or why exactly wouldn’t they use their massive stockpiles and offer free money to strangers instead? Or is it perhaps a marketing gimmick to get us signed-up and lower the rates later?"

"Don't get me wrong - I think this is great to get the word out and get BTC more mainstream. But has anyone thought about how KYC/AML laws have bastardized the process? You put a buck into the Coinstar machine, and get… a voucher? You then take that to Coinme’s website and claim your crypto by… wait for it… entering in your name, phone number, and email address into this startup companies website.

What “John Doe” trying out BTC on a whim at Wal-Mart as he walks by the kiosk is going to be cool with that? I was actually going to run out at lunchtime and use it just to post a pic on my social media until I saw the KYC collection step, and that’s coming from a guy who’s already a Bitcoiner. I hope I’m wrong but an experience like this is just going to further solidify the masses association between crypto and scammy/dangerous/scary.

I don’t know the process, but if they put in $20 BEFORE finding out exactly how the voucher system works and the info that they will have to provide, they will be pissed.

I just want to reiterate that this is not the fault of Coinstar nor Coinme, and I commend them both on stepping up and sticking their neck out for BTC adoption. I just wish the legacy-system laws would stop shooting us in the foot at every GD turn."

**Introduction: The “global village” created by the Internet has restored the original sense of distance in the face of the huge obstacles of cross-border payment.**

Nowadays, with the rapid development of economic globalization, the economic ties between the countries of the world are closer, global trade is constantly taking place, and there are more and more scenarios for cross-border payment. However, due to the large number of intermediate links involved in traditional cross-border payment, high handling fees and poor timeliness of collection and payment, which causes inconvenience to cross-border merchants in cross-border payment.

Traditional cross-border payments are slow and expensive

Traditional cross-border remittances are mainly rely on remittance companies, post offices, banks and some offshore fund. In international trade, cross-border payment faces with both expensive and slow problems. Each fee does not seem to be high, but it has not been a small number in the long run.

📷 

The traditional cross-border payment settlement method is exemplified by the world's leading express remittance company“Western Union”. Even though it has the largest and most advanced electronic exchange financial network in the world, the fastest time to pay for cross-border payments is 2 to 3 days. If you use ordinary bank wire transfer, it takes 3-7 days to wait. And the cost of each transaction is 30 to 40 dollars.

While technological advances such as the Internet have changed most communications and business models, these cumbersome processes have hampered economic growth and created additional costs for large administrative and compliance departments.

The trend of globalization is irreversible. What new technologies will empower cross-border payments in the future?

Globalization is irreversible, Atox supports for cross-border payments

Although in the short term, Sino-US trade war, British Brexit and other isolationism phenomena emerged, the globalization trend of cross-border trade is irreversible. Because the Internet and new technologies have connected the global market, the demand for cross-border trade, export e-commerce or cross-border payments is increasing.

The market is looking for safe, efficient, and low-cost cross-border payment methods, so the blockchain, known as the fourth technological revolution, can produce explosive chemical reactions with cross-border payments in this era of ""blockchain""? 

The answer is yes. The application prospects of blockchain technology applying in the financial field, especially cross-border payment, are widely optimistic. At the tuyere of such a great age, AtoX was born.

AtoX builds a common decentralized trading system based on blockchain technology, providing users with real-time payment and settlement services in cross-border and any currency worldwide. Cross-border payment will become extremely convenient and low-cost to enhance the cross-border remittance service experience while promoting value transfer and settlement efficiency.

📷 

AtoX aims to be the first brand of cross-border settlement, to contribute to the global settlement industry, to create a vertical ecological chain and an open ecosystem, to achieve the interconnection and sharing linkage of the whole industry. From the view of time, AtoX's lightning payment initiates a transaction, and complete it in 3 seconds, eliminating too many operations and cumbersome process, so that you can easily pay at any time and anywhere.

It's inevitable that blockchain technology has brought about a convenient reform of cross-border payment and settlement. As a new star in the field of public blockchain, AtoX relies on the characteristics of blockchain technology to provide efficient payment and settlement services and other related services for merchants and consumers around the world, so that trading methods have a better trust mechanism, making lower transaction costs and more smaller resistant.

"Few days ago I found an old post from Ryan Castellucci about decoding this qr code:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1r044r/im\_curious\_to\_see\_if\_anyone\_can\_recover\_the\_key/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1r044r/im_curious_to_see_if_anyone_can_recover_the_key/)

Probably the qr code that posted Ryan has not enough information to be decoded, but I decided to give it a try just for fun (I know the address has 0 balance). 

I did never decode any qr code by hand, and I few days ago I didn't even know how the information in qr code is decoded. 

After reading the internet and watching videos on youtube I learn a few things about qr codes, but the information posted there are not accurate I believe. First thing to mention here is the Error Correction and mask information bits. Some websites say that the EC and mask needs to be XOR'ed by 10101, some other like wikipedia says nothing about that.

So the first question here is, what mask do have the qr code below. Is it 111 (no XOR) or 010 (with XOR)?

The second question is about mask patterns, these are also not the same on internet. For example Wikipedia says that the mask 111 has pattern (j % 3), but other sites tell it is (((i\*j) % 3+i+j) % 2), so what mask pattern has the image below?

I also tried to debug the zbarimg library to see if I can extract some usefull information about the scanned qr code and came to the place in code, where it says that data encoding in this qr code is: Byte encoding (8 bits per character), but after demasking this qr code with different patterns it just does not fit.

Also it would be nice it there was some tool, that coule tell all the information about qr code, for example what mask pattern it uses and all other meta information. Is there somewhere such a tool?

"I see google, ibm and etc making their own block chains and they are not traded for money. Is this ecosystem artificially created? Just an honest question."

&amp;#x200B;

Fidelity Investments, the largest asset managers firm, digital assets solution branch – Fidelity Digital Assets, announced that its Bitcoin custody service has gone live with “a select group of eligible clients”, earlier today on their official Twitter handle. The firm that aims to provide Bitcoin custodial services to institutional investors first announced this news comes almost a month earlier, stating that have selected clients whom they will be serving with their initial solutions.

The announcement read:

“WE ARE LIVE WITH A SELECT GROUP OF ELIGIBLE CLIENTS AND WILL CONTINUE ROLLING OUT SLOWLY. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF HEDGE FUNDS, FAMILY OFFICES, PENSIONS, ENDOWMENTS, OTHER INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS”

In their initial announcement, the solutions provider stated that they have built a strong technical and operational standards best suitable for institutions, meeting clients expectations from an investment giant. They had also stated that their initial clients are “an important part” of the “final testing and process refinement periods”. This, in turn, would help the Fidelity provide their platform services to a “broader set of eligible institutions.”

The blog post read:

“OUR MISSION IS MUCH BROADER THAN PRODUCTS. INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST IN DIGITAL ASSETS IS EXPANDING, AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO PROCEED.”

This comes as a euphoric announcement to several members of the community as it marks as one of the first steps taken to open the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors. This is mainly because of the custody solutions and trading venue platform provided by the financial giant. More so, some also believe that the changes bought by institutional players of Fidelity would bring some light in the regulatory stance on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

"Can’t wrap your head around stablecoins? You’re not alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people struggle to grasp the idea of a stablecoin. How can they claim to be both cryptocurrencies and direct equivalents of fiat cash? Can they even be called crypto? Isn’t a centralized, bank-facilitated system the exactly opposite of what cryptocurrencies stand for? And why wouldn’t someone simply use digitized fiat instead?

"Mexico is NOT prohibiting anything:

https://twitter.com/Bitso/status/1105643405055422466


And the regulations are not even in place yet, there are still 83 days left for comments. Please enter your comment here:

https://www.banxico.org.mx/ConsultaRegulacionWeb/comments.jsp?id=2011

You can get the Proposed Regulations PDF here (it's the 3rd/bottom one):

More info: **""Banxico 2.0 Rules: Nothing changes, Bitso will continue to operate as it has until now"".**

https://blog.bitso.com/nada-cambia-bitso-continuar%C3%A1-operando-como-hasta-ahora-b1d89486502e

&gt; However, this does not mean that the operation with cryptocurrencies is prohibited.
&gt; 
&gt; Since its inception, Bitso has functioned as a regulated platform based on international standards and best practices. Last year, with the publication of the Fintech Law, an innovation framework was created for end users, key players, companies, government and financial institutions. The foregoing, with the aim of promoting financial inclusion and promoting innovation in financial services, through the use of new technologies.
&gt; 
&gt; We believe that this circular is not in line with the principles of the Fintech Law, undermining principles of innovation, financial inclusion and competition to provide consumer benefits, which were pillars of this Act.
&gt; 
&gt; Among other things, we will continue to build a close dialogue with the authorities to promote the healthy development of the Fintech sector, for the benefit of all Mexicans and with the objective of continuing to position Mexico as a leader in innovation and financial inclusion with the use of new technologies.
&gt; 
&gt; In that sense we will promote that the rule contains the following characteristics:
&gt; 
&gt; * Be aligned with the Fintech Law.
&gt; * Follow the best international practices.
&gt; * Defend the right of Mexican users to technology.
&gt; 
&gt; In Bitso we will continue offering our services in the same way that we have done so far. On the other hand, rest assured that we are and will continue to defend your right to access technology.

Hello,

Unfortunately I was put in a terrible predicament where I believe someone scammed me for Bitcoin I sent through LBC. The person is or was impersonating Danny Polotsky the CEO of Coinflip ATMs. I've already contact the police and LBC. I was able to follow the transactions on block explorer to what appears to be an exchange hot wallet. Is there anyway to identify the exchange so I can get them involved and forward the information to the police? Any help would be massively amazing.

Thanks!

"I hear about people like Andreas who get paid in bitcoin and don’t use fiat, but is there anyone else out there who hold a significant amount of their portfolio in bitcoin? Or even all of it? I know I know “don’t invest more than you’re willing to use,” but does anyone else out there believe in the technology to the point where it’s their largest asset class? Just curious to see where everyone else’s thought process is!"

"***The Economic Effects of Inflation*** - What has Government done to our Money? by Rothbard

To gauge the economic effects of inflation, let us see what happens when a group of counterfeiters set about their work. Suppose the economy has a supply of 10,000 gold ounces, and counterfeiters, so cunning that they cannot be detected, pump in 2,000 “ounces” more. What will be the consequences? First, there will be a clear gain to the counterfeiters. They take the newly created money and use it to buy goods and services. The new money works its way, step by step, throughout the economic system. **As the new money spreads, it bids prices up—as we have seen, new money can only dilute the effectiveness of each dollar.** But this dilution takes time and is therefore uneven; in the meantime, some people gain and other people lose. In short, the counterfeiters and their local retailers have found their incomes increased before any rise in the prices of the things they buy. But, on the other hand, people in remote areas of the economy, who have not yet received the new money, find their buying prices rising before their incomes. Retailers at the other end of the country, for example, will suffer losses. **The first receivers of the new money gain most, and at the expense of the latest receivers**.

**Inflation, then, confers no general social benefit; instead, it redistributes the wealth in favor of the firstcomers and at the expense of the laggards in the race.** And inflation is, in effect, a race—to see who can get the new money earliest. The latecomers—the ones stuck with the loss—are often called the “fixed income groups.” Ministers, teachers, people on salaries, lag notoriously behind other groups in acquiring the new money. Particular sufferers will be those depending on fixed money contracts—contracts made in the days before the inflationary rise in prices. Life insurance beneficiaries and annuitants, retired persons living off pensions, landlords with long term leases, bondholders and other creditors, those holding cash, all will bear the brunt of the inflation. They will be the ones who are “taxed.” 

Inflation has other disastrous effects. **It distorts that keystone of our economy: business calculation. Since prices do not all change uniformly and at the same speed, it becomes very difficult for business to separate the lasting from the transitional, and gauge truly the demands of consumers or the cost of their operations.** For example, accounting practice enters the “cost” of an asset at the amount the business has paid for it. But if inflation intervenes, the cost of replacing the asset on the books. As a result, business accounting will seriously overstate their profits during inflation—and may even consume capital while presumably increasing their investments. Similarly, stockholders and real estate holders will acquire capital gains during an inflation that are not really “gains” at all. But they may spend part of these gains without realizing that they are thereby consuming their original capital. **By creating illusory profits and distorting economic calculation, inflation will suspend the free market’s penalizing of inefficient, and rewarding of efficient, firms.** Almost all firms will seemingly prosper. The general atmosphere of a “sellers’ market” will lead to a decline in the quality of goods and of service to consumers, since consumers often resist price increases less when they occur in the form of downgrading of quality. The quality of work will decline in an inflation for a more subtle reason: people become enamored of “get-rich-quick” schemes, seemingly within their grasp in an era of ever-rising prices, and often scorn sober effort. Inflation also penalizes thrift and encourages debt, for any sum of money loaned will be repaid in dollars of lower purchasing power than when originally received. The incentive, then, is to borrow and repay later rather than save and lend. **Inflation, therefore, lowers the general standard of living in the very course of creating a tinsel atmosphere of “prosperity.”** 

**Fortunately, inflation cannot go on forever.** For eventually people wake up to this form of taxation; they wake up to the continual shrinkage in the purchasing power of their dollar. At first, when prices rise, people say: “Well, this is abnormal, the product of some emergency. I will postpone my purchases and wait until prices go back down.” This is the common attitude during the first phase of an inflation. This notion moderates the price rise itself, and conceals the inflation further, since the demand for money is thereby increased. But, as inflation proceeds, people begin to realize that prices are going up perpetually as a result of perpetual inflation. Now people will say: “I will buy now, though prices are ‘high,’ because if I wait, prices will go up still further.” As a result, the demand for money now falls and prices go up more, proportionately, than the increase in the money supply. At this point, the government is often called upon to “relieve the money shortage” caused by the accelerated price rise, and it inflates even faster. Soon, the country reaches the stage of the “crack-up boom,” when people say: “I must buy anything now— anything to get rid of money which depreciates on my hands.” The supply of money skyrockets, the demand plummets, and prices rise astronomically. Production falls sharply, as people spend more and more of their time finding ways to get rid of their money. The monetary system has, in effect, broken down completely, and the economy reverts to other moneys, if they are attainable—other metal, foreign currencies if this is a one-country inflation, or even a return to barter conditions. The monetary system has broken down under the impact of inflation. 

This condition of hyper-inflation is familiar historically in the assignats of the French Revolution, the Continentals of the American Revolution, and especially the German crisis of 1923, and the Chinese and other currencies after World War II. 

**A final indictment of inflation is that whenever the newly issued money is first used as loans to business, inflation causes the dread “business cycle.”** This silent but deadly process, undetected for generations, works as follows: new money is issued by the banking system, under the aegis of government, and loaned to business. To businessmen, the new funds seem to be genuine investments, but these funds do not, like free-market investments, arise from voluntary savings. The new money is invested by businessmen in various projects, and paid out to workers and other factors as higher wages and prices. As the new money filters down to the whole economy, the people tend to re establish their old voluntary consumption/saving proportions.

In short, if people wish to save and invest about 20 percent of their incomes and consume the rest, new bank money loaned to business at first makes the saving proportion look higher. When the new money seeps down to the public, it re-establishes its old 20–80 proportion, and many investments are now revealed to be wasteful. **Liquidation of the wasteful investments of the inflationary boom constitutes the depression phase of the business cycle.**"

So, I go on their website to download the app for pc. When I click on download they redirect me to microsoft stor, WTF???

Can  BitGO confirm they hold crypto for Celsius and how much. They claim  they are all up for transparency, how is that not public?

In  the app when you are about to deposit they say they keep the coins in  Bitgo but ""from time to time"" they move them to exchanges and others to  short the market.

Well you have to do that more than ""from time to time"" to pay 5% interest.

I'm worried that I'll have to respond to inquiries from banks or even the IRS which I just don't want to have to deal with, especially if I have to prove where I got the funds from because again, I want it all to be completely anonymous (aside from what I'm depositing into my bank account).

"If we look at bitcoin pre 2017 it was seldom known outside of some communities. Now 2017 was the first time you started seeing/hearing people talk about bitcoin so I would consider this the time it was on the public's radar. Even though it wasn't really respected right off the bat, people starting realizing the massive potential BTC and crypto in general had.

My take is that most of the people with big money started to realize the crazy potential that this space was presenting, but the price had already ballooned because the public was buying it up, even though they had no clue what they were buying. So the big money people wanted a piece of this new tech, but didn't want to jump right in not knowing when the bubble would pop. Also they didn't want the bubble to continue while they were on the sideline, so why not pop the bubble?

This is where I think the futures came into play. This made an easy opportunity for big money to short BTC and kind of help push the bubble to pop. They could essentially force pressure on the price to go down, and all it takes is a little bit. When you have a ton of people owning an asset that they don't understand, they will panic to get out at the slightest sign things are going downhill. Then you start the chain reaction. Once the first wave sells, it triggers the next and so on.

Now that the price looks to have bottomed, or is at least near it the CBOE decides they don't need futures anymore because public interest isn't good enough. 

Is it really because the public interest is down? Or is it because they popped the bubble and have positioned themselves now for the future?"

I always hear don't use site X or I tried withdrawing funds from site Y and its been stuck for 3 months. I need a way to buy bitcoin that I can't fuck something up, anytime I get into something I always fuck it up at first and I would prefer not to lose any money."

Hey everybody. Yesterday i've got into a BIG trouble. 

My PC was encrypted by hackers and now they want to be paid 4btc \~$15k

&amp;#x200B;

I'm VERY upset and don't really know what to do. My computer contains a whole bunch of really important files like presentations, reports and other work staff, all logins and passwords (including bank accounts) and memorial family photos (really important for me). I can't desribe what I feel.

I have the money they demand, but I simply can't access them to buy freaking bitcoins. The worst thing is that if I don't pay within 24 hours the sum will increase.

&amp;#x200B;

During last few hours I read a HUGE amount of info,  and there is no other way to get access to my computer back than paying them.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate ANY help with decrypting, especially financial. I ask for your help to collect the amount needed to pay the ransom, and swear by God to give back everything, till the last dollar. As well, I'll do my best to add 10% for EVERYBODY who will help to show my gratitude. Probably that would take me some time, several weeks maximum, but I promise that all your money will be given back.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm VERY upset, wellness of my whole family is at risk and I REQUIRE YOUR SUPPORT. During all my time at reddit I did my best to help everybody I can, now it's my time to ask for help.

First of all, I’m sorry for the possible mistakes. English is not my native and this is my first article out here :)

The total computational power in the Bitcoin network reached the indicators of the beginning of November last year, which is the maximum level for these past four months.

So, according to [Cryptocointraders](http://cryptocointraders.org/), on Tuesday, March 19, this figure was more than **52 EH / s.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wo5iv31j2an21.png

All experts have repeatedly reminded earlier, that price of Bitcoin follows the hashrate, and the growth of this indicator states that optimism is on the market, in particular among miners.

It is also worth noting that the current level of hashrate is more than four times higher than the figures that could be observed in December 2017, when the price of Bitcoin rose to a historical maximum of around **$ 20,000.**

So I’d better consider opening Long over the short position.

Happy trading!"

"I have got a question concerning LN-transactions. Many anti-LN people (like Ver and co.) always say that it's impossible to route big transactions through the LN because there is virtually no route that could forward a payment of let's say 100,000$ (as an example). I think most of us agree that payments that big should be settled on-chain anyways, even if fees **might** go into double digits again in $-terms, but let's just do a thought experiment here:

Node 1 has wants to route 100,000$ to Node 6

Node 1 has a channel with Node 2 with a capacity of 100,000$

Node 2 has a channel with Node 3 with a capacity of 70$

Node 3 has a channel with Node 4 with a capacity of 40$

Node 4 has a channel with Node 5 with a capacity of 60$

Node 5 has a channel with Node 6 with a capacity of 50$

If I understand LN correctly, Node 1 can send a transaction to Node 6 with a maximum throughput of 40$ because the channel between Node 3 and Node 4 limits the size of the transaction to 40$. Couldn't we just go ahead and split the 100,000$ payment into 2,500 payments à 40$ then? Assuming we pay 1 satoshi per hop and BTC price is 4,000$, that would be total fee of (2,500 * 4 * 4,000$) / (100,000,000) = 0,40$ which is not that much imo. The wallet app could just go ahead, find the route with the biggest throughput-potential and divide the transaction by that amount. Everything under the hood. The only thing the user might notice is that the payment would cost a little bit more in fees than a ""normal"" LN-transaction, which is perfectly fine considering that the payment is huge and it's still dealt within the speed of light. If there are flaws in my logic or if I misunderstood of LN works please feel free to correct me. Thanks in advance."

However, he also stated that he doesn’t see Tesla getting involved with crypto, as they are “just really trying to accelerate the advance of sustainable energy”. Additionally, his main criticism to Bitcoin was in regards of the amount of energy it consumes.

"When a government issues debt it starts off issuing debt in it own native currency. That is until confidence is lost in that currency because of too much debt issuance (inflation). At that point they begin issuing debt in a stronger currency (USD generally); see venezuela etc.

But... what happens when the USD, Euro, Yen etc all hit the same debt wall and loss of confidence in their currency. What alternative currency do they then issue debt in? Gold? Hardly.. bitcoin? That is actually not impossible.

Imagine.. it is 2030, the USD Euro and Yen are all collapsing under their own debt weight. Citizens are flocking to bitcoin. 30% of the worlds population hold atleast some small amount of bitcoin now. Governments need money, taxes are not enough, they need something real. They issue bitcoin denominated bonds as a mechanism to fund their operation and to repay these bonds they need to collect taxes in bitcoin.

Its not what they want but it is their only option.

This heralds the point in time where bitcoin becomes default global reserve currency.

No armageddon, just a relatively smooth transition from one currency to another. With the new benefit of no debt issued beyond potential tax revenue, no inflation and no system of infinite money creation that attracts corrupt politicians.

While the stock market isn't as hyped unless when there is a company that IPO's and has its first trading day. Anyways what do you guys  think about this? 


"I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin, but I just had this thought... We all know that at a certain point all Bitcoin will have been mined and no more will be coming into circulation any more. We also know that some small amount of Bitcoin is being ""lost"" all the time when someone loses their recovery phrase, or someone dies without passing their Bitcoin on etc... So after all the Bitcoin has been mined, and we keep slowly losing Bitcoin from circulation, won't we eventually get to a point where effectively all Bitcoin has been lost?"

"So today I decided to move the rest of my bitcoin (small amount yes I know not my keys not my bitcoin) off of Coinbase when I learned that my account is no longer verified. I’ve had a Coinbase account for almost 2 years and I verified the account way back then. All of the sudden I’m not verified anymore and have to resubmit all of my documents once again. 

Is this a normal occurrence and has anyone else had this happen to them? Luckily they are super quick at verifying now, but it’s still a pain in the ass and it’s kind of troubling. "

"Hello, 

I was thinking about what would the investment world be like say once bitcoin takes over. Warning I'm not a financial expert or anything but will like to know your thoughts on this example. 

Let's say bitcoin and fiat are still around but bitcoin is very viable. I invest 3 bitcoin in some business that produces X product for Y amount of Satoshi/Fiat. then we have a bitcoin halving and the prices of bitcoin/fiat continues to rise. in this example investing 3 bitcoins would have been a bad idea? Feels like deflation will continually make it harder to generate more bitcoin as oppose to a inflationary example where my dollars invested continuously generate more dollars. Am I wrong?

"I'm developing a slot machine game with 5 slots, each slot has 6 options (pear, lemon, ..., etc.).

Each spin, 5 random values get generated, one for each slot, making the slots spin to the option bound to their random number. When 3 or more consecutive numbers get generated in a spin eg.: (12444 or 42223 or 11111) the player ""wins"" the spin.

The won amount should be calculated depending on the number of consecutive equal numbers in a won spin, the amount the player bet that spin, and the value of the consecutive numbers (1 should be worth less than 6).

See included image below for an example win chart, in short the question would be: how can I calculate the multiplier for each option (eg. 25, 5 in the image) which would result in a +-45% chance of making a profit on the machine? If you do the calculation and create a chart with the multipliers needed for me and show how you've done it I'll send you 200,000sat

The single greatest reason why the US fiat Dollar is the greatest currency on the planet, is because it is backed by guns. It is backed by lots of gun. The US Dollar is backed by the strongest military in the world, most effective battle hardened Army, largest most powerful navy that opens the world’s water ways for free trade to benefit all the world, and has the strongest Air Force. Like it or not it’s true. You might think that the computing power of Bitcoin as a support for value but it is not. They are known as miners, miners only maintain bitcoin blockchain and that is it. Once the price of bitcoin falls AGAIN miners will shut down and reallocate their capital towards crypto with real value.       

&amp;#x200B;

Because bitcoin has no value, it makes Bitcoin’s perceived price based off of speculation. Basically, what the next guy is willing to pay for it. If that next guy doesn’t want to buy because they realize that it has zero value, then the price drops. We all understand that it meets the college text book definitions of money, but like all college freshman who worships Che Guevara and Fidel Castro and the Bolivarian socialist utopia, you soon grow up and realize that it is all Fud. The concept of bitcoin reads well and in a text book and could operate as a functioning currency in a utopian society, but once you begin to understand that the only thing propping up the value is the next fool that is willing to pay for it, then the bottom begins to falls out. People will point to other things like gold and say that it is driven by perceived value. While this is true, however, with gold people can actually hold it in their hands and wear it as jewelry ect... Because bitcoin is only driven by speculation and had no value you better sell bitcoin now, because once intelligent money moves away from bitcoin only fools will be left holding Fud. 

Smart money will move towards crypto projects that have real value. For example, Enigma, the value of Enigma is basically the value of information. Like Facebook, Google, and all the other tech companies their business model is based off of having information and selling it. Enigma will be the medium of exchange for information and the network will house and process data. If you are looking to invest in the next project like Google who will revolutionize the world, then invest in Enigma now before the price passes bitcoin.   

&amp;#x200B;

\*I am not your financial advisor and write this as my personal opinion. In full disclosure I recently bought Enigma because this project is a winner and to show how serious I am about investing in this project I actually barrowed money on a credit card through Binance to purchase Enigma. Some might say I am a degenerate speculating on this project and I will rebuttal with that I have meticulously studied the crypto market and this project far exceeds all others and will change the world in the next couple of years.  

&amp;#x200B;

At the time of writing this article the price of Enigma is $.43, so If you like this article, feel free to throw some crypto this way, my ERC-20 wallet address is: 0x0b8396CbD9199D47216A703EB861af632fC9ad46"

"According to the CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin rose to the level of $ 4,054 on Tuesday, February 19. In addition, the coin is close to a new record in the current year.

"I do not seek to create confrontations or meaningless discussions, but I am interested in the opinion of people who have been in the community for a long time and are well informed, because I sincerely find it hard to think that El Btc could reach such a figure someday ... since many did not think that it could never reach $100 and reached or 1000k, let alone 20k and finally arrived. But for it to reach 1 million, taking into account the maximum supply, only Bitcoin would have to have a marketcap of 21 billion in order to reach that price (in some countries they talk about trillions, but at least in Spain I am sure that 21,000,000,000,000,000 is 21 billion) it seems to me that an enormous and ridiculous amount of money would have to come in to get to that point.

"Hello,

While I'm waiting for help from CEX.IO support team, I thought I would write here in case some of you have been in a similar situation or know what's going on and what to do.
Basically, I've tried to withdraw some funds from CEX.IO onto my bank card, the same one I used to make the deposits. My withdrawals get instantly rejected. Their support team told me my bank is rejecting payments to my bank card and to contact them. I contacted the bank and they said the merchant, cex.io, is trying to take money from my card, not put money on it. Since I don't have any money on my card, obviously these transactions get rejected by the bank.

I'm waiting to hear back from cex.io after I wrote them what the bank said. Just wondering if any of you know if this would be a bank or a cex.io issue and what to do next. Should I try to make a deposit from cex.io and hope it goes through as withdrawal? :D

&amp;#x200B;

The FBI is seeking potential victims who invested in the cryptocurrency Bitconnect coin (BCC), which was first released through an initial coin offering orchestrated by Bitconnect in November 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

For a majority of BCC’s existence, the only place to purchase, trade, or sell the cryptocurrency was the through the proprietary exchange hosted by Bitconnect. By mid-December 2017, BCC boasted a market cap of over $2.5 billion. Bitconnect guaranteed investors up to a 10 percent total return per month on their investment, following a tiered-investment system based on the sum of an investor’s initial deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

The entire market for BCC crashed in late January 2018, after two U.S. state-level securities regulators issued public letters warning investors of the Ponzi-type nature of Bitconnect. This led to Bitconnect completely shutting down its exchange for BCC, eliminating the market for the cryptocurrency and stranding investors with near-worthless cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

If you invested in Bitconnect, please complete the questionnaire on the website. Your responses are voluntary but would be useful in the federal assessment of this matter and to identify you as a BCC investor and/or potential victim. Based on the responses provided, you may be contacted by the FBI and asked to provide additional information."

I want to get a couple of 100 Trillion Dollar bills from Zimbabwe. I know it's not related to Bitcoin directly but since it's about hyperinflation I think it's fair to say it's not completely irrelevant either.

"I've been kicking this idea around for a while, and would like to get your feedback before investing any money. I think that in addition to promoting adoption through word of mouth and things like bumper-stickers, I think a conversation starter that *doesn't* directly interfere with generally accepted professional dress codes, could be the way to grass-root this thing into the mainstream.

I got this idea because in my place of work, we only accept cash. About 2 years ago, I would occasionally add 'or Bitcoin' half-joking, when a guest would ask how they could pay. Most laugh, some ask ""What's Bitcoin"", some say ""Really?"" to which I say ""Yeah, I'll take Bitcoin!"". Realizing, that if they actually did give me say $100 in Bitcoin, I would simply throw a $100 bill from my pocket into the register, and call it a day.

This got me thinking that there must be thousands of us that could say, deliver the check to a table we're serving in a casual cafe... someone notices the wristband, and says ""Can I pay with Bitcoin"" and you say ""Sure"". They scan your QR Code, you walk over to the register and either pay with your own debit card, or cash... and BAM, we're one step closer to world domination?

Or, it just starts conversations that make Bitcoin a little less fringe, and a little more acceptable.

As for the design, I was thinking something like this:

"I drove my friend to pick up a vehicle he was going to buy for a few thousand, we got to the sellers property at around 7pm.

My friend thought he could either use PayPal or bank transfer easily and that would be that. Good God no. There were two people at the property with a PayPal account, my friend tried to send the money to both accounts. First they thought my friend could just send the money to an email, nope. Then the sellers were bumbling around trying to remember their passwords to their accounts and when they finally did, they realize that they weren't verified. They both go through the process to verify. At the end they realize they have to wait a few days to be accepted. Pfft.

My friend tries to transfer through the mobile banking app, denied. My friend then calls his bank to transfer the money. The bank tell him he has to transfer the money after midnight and couldn't do so now! WTF! My friend then has to log in to Internet banking on the sellers laptop. Adds the seller as a payee and then finally sends the amount. But wait, it doesn't instantly transact because it's a large sum, it transfers the next day. Luckily the seller wasn't too bothered and just took a picture of the confirmation of transaction and handed the vehicle over. If it was any other guy our journey would have been a waste.

Madness. Spent 45 minutes trying to send a few thousand to a private seller. Granted my friend could have just withdrawn the money earlier in the day but he leads a busy life and didn't have time.

"I wanted to test if it's already possible to create an e-commerce store without getting stuck somewhere when you don't have any coding knowledge.

Honestly, I was surprised how easy it is to set up one with the help of some sort of CMS and additional plugins. I did some research and it seems Wordpress is still the king for creating simple e-stores using Woocommerce plugin.

So for testing, I bought cheap shared hosting plan for $2 bucks (paid using bitcoin) from [lowendbox](https://lowendbox.com) offers

Bought a domain from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for $2 bucks as well (also paid using bitcoin)

Installed Wordpress on it using automatic installer that every hosting provider has nowadays.

Activated a free theme compatible with Woocommerce from Themes section in Wordpress

I thought the biggest challenge will be the integration of lightning merchant into woocommerce as its a fairly new thing but it seems there is already bunch of merchants that have native plugins for it! Great! My eye got caught two of them [Strike](https://strike.acinq.co/) and [OpenNode](https://www.opennode.co/)

After this I got myself a free SSL certificate from [sslforfree](https://www.sslforfree.com/) and activated it using cPanel.

I've choosen Strike (was the first one I tried and it worked anyway), downloaded the plugin, activated it, entered my API Key and ta-da! it works!
I'm a proud owner of useless store that costed me $4 bucks. Cannot be happier.

Didn't have to touch any code, nothing! I can also expand functionality of the store using another plugins as well.

Some other plugins I used:  
Checkout Field Editor for WooCommerce --- To get rid of the billing fields.  
Disable cart page for WooCommerce --- To get rid of the unnecessary cart page.  
Really Simple SSL --- Easily enabling https everywhere.  


Anyway... Who is fancy to buy some prayers for 1 sat today? I guess I will keep the site online until host expires but for now feel free to invite friends to test the glorious lightning network. With the help of @GiverOfBitcoin anyone should be able to try it easily now. I also added a quick tutorial how to get free sats from him on the website as well.

"***DEFLATION - The Ethics of Money Production by Jorg Guido Hulsmann***

Still another variant of the same basic fallacy that we just discussed is the alleged need to fight deflation. The word “deflation” can be defined in various ways. According to the most widely accepted definition today, deflation is a sustained decrease of the price level. Older authors have often used the expression “deflation” to denote a decreasing money supply, and some contemporary authors use it to characterize a decrease of the inflation rate. All of these definitions are acceptable, depending on the purpose of the analysis. None of them, however, lends itself to justifying an artificial increase of the money supply. The harmful character of deflation is today one of the sacred dogmas of monetary policy. **The champions of the fight against deflation usually present six arguments to make their case**^14

1. One, in their eyes it is a matter of historical experience that deflation has negative repercussions on aggregate production and, therefore, on the standard of living. To explain this presumed historical record, they hold, 
1. Two, that deflation incites the market participants to postpone buying because they speculate on ever lower prices. Furthermore, they consider, 
1. Three, that a declining price level makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. These difficulties threaten to entail, 
1. Four, a crisis within the banking industry and thus a dramatic curtailment of credit. 
1. Five, they claim that deflation in conjunction with “sticky prices” results in unemployment. And finally, 
1. Six, they consider that deflation might reduce nominal interest rates to such an extent that a monetary policy of “cheap money,” to stimulate employment and production, would no longer be possible, because the interest rate cannot be decreased below zero.

**However, theoretical and empirical evidence substantiating these claims is either weak or lacking altogether.**^15 

***First***, in historical fact, deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production. Long-term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and/or countries with increasing price levels. Even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system, **empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long-run growth**.^16 

***Second***, it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions. However, this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production. Notice that, in the presence of deflationary tendencies, purchase decisions in general, and consumption in particular, does not come to a halt. For one thing, human beings act under the “constraint of the stomach.” Even the most neurotic misers, who cherish saving a penny above anything else, must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day. And all others—that is, the great majority of the population— will by and large buy just as many consumers’ goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment. Even though they expect prices to decline ever further, they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later (economists call this “time preference”). In actual fact, then, consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment. **And this marginal reduction of consumer spending, far from impairing aggregate production, will rather tend to increase it**. The simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved; that is, they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment.

***Third***, it is correct that deflation—especially unanticipated deflation—makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. In the case of a massive deflation shock, widespread bankruptcy might result. Such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms, factories, and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits. However, from the aggregate (social) point of view, it does not matter who controls the existing resources. What matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used. Now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically. It merely diminishes their monetary value, which is why their present owners go bankrupt. **Thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners.** The net impact on production is likely to be zero.

***Fourth***, it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry, because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks. However, for the same reasons that we just discussed, while this might be devastating for some banks, it is not so for society as a whole. **The crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources; it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed**. It follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources; it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land, factories, streets, and so on. In the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present-day monetary authorities. Deflation certainly has much disruptive potential. However, as will become even more obvious in the following chapters, it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply. It reduces the wealth of fractional-reserve banks, and their customers— debt-ridden governments, entrepreneurs, and consumers. But as we have argued, such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment. The destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often “creative destruction” in the Schumpeterian sense^18.

***Fifth***. In the past eighty years, the sticky-prices argument has played an important role in monetary debates. According to this argument, the manipulation of the money supply might be a suitable instrument to re-establish a lost equilibrium on certain markets, most notably on the labor market. Suppose that powerful labor unions push up nominal wage rates in all industries to such an extent that entrepreneurs can no longer profitably employ a great part of the workforce at these wages. The result is mass unemployment. But if it were possible to substantially increase the money supply, then the selling prices of the entrepreneurs might rise enough to allow for the reintegration of the unemployed workers into the division of labor. Now, the argument goes, under a gold or silver standard, this kind of policy is impossible for purely technical reasons because the money supply is inflexible. Only a paper money provides the technical wherewithal to implement pro-employment policies. Thus we have here a prima facie justification for suppressing the natural commodity monies and supporting a paper money standard.

This argument grew into prominence during the 1920s in Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries. After World War II, it became something like a dogma of economic policy. But this does not alter the fact that it is sheer fallacy, and it is not even difficult to see the root of the fallacy. The argument is in fact premised on the notion that monetary policy makers can constantly outsmart the labor unions. The managers of the printing press can again and again surprise the labor-union leaders through another round of expansionist
monetary policy. Clearly, this is a silly assumption and in retrospect it is very astonishing that responsible men could ever have taken it seriously. The labor unions were not fooled. Faced with the reality of expansionist monetary policy, they eventually increased their wage demands to compensate for the declining purchasing power of money. **The result was stagflation—high unemployment plus inflation—a phenomenon that in the past thirty years has come to plague countries with strong labor unions such as France and Germany**.

***Sixth***. Another widespread fallacy is the idea that paper money could help to decrease the interest rate, thus promoting economic growth. If new paper tickets are printed and then first offered on the credit market, so the argument goes, the supply of credit is increased and as a consequence the price of credit—interest—declines. Cheap money is now available for businessmen all over the country. They will invest more than they otherwise would have invested, and therefore economic growth will be enhanced.

There are actually a good number of different fallacies involved in this argument, and it is impossible for us to deal with all of them here.^19 [...] In short, economic growth is diminished below the level it could otherwise have reached. To sum up, it is by no means sure that politically induced increases of the money supply will lead to a decrease of the interest rate below the level it would have reached in a free economy. The success of cheap-money policy is especially unlikely when the policy is not adopted on an ad-hoc basis, but turned into a guiding principle of economic policy. But the fundamental objection to this policy is that it is counterproductive even if it succeeds in decreasing the interest rate. **The consequence would be more waste and thus less growth**.

"I am learning about Bitcoin and I am seeking a help from this community. 

As far as I understand, nodes validate blocks and transactions, and miners are not nodes (although they also can be a node). Also, while the bitcoin mining is currently heavily dominated by few mining pools, such mining pools consist of many miners. 

So, if one mining pool has 51% of the total hashing power and sends invalid transactions, these invalid transactions will not be propagated to the Bitcoin network (because peer nodes will not pass such invalid transactions to other nodes). For this reason, I wonder how 51% attract is possible in theory.

Furthermore, according to Andreas Antonopoulos, if one nation (or a super rich) take 51% hashing power and attack the bitcoin network, the attach would be capable of performing a double-spending only once because the Bitcoin network will detect this malicious transaction in the next block (10 minutes later) ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM)). I wonder how the network will detect this, given that a longer chain is supposed to be considered as genuine.   


I do not fully understand the concept of the Bitcoin network, so there can be errors in my question and the question itself is very messy. I apology for this. 

Many thanks in advance. "

"Hello everyone, I’ve been reading about bitcoin and really want to understand it completely.  So far, I read that bitcoin use a peer-to-peer network, this is used because bitcoin wants to eliminate the problem of double-spending. And in order to prove that the transaction was not double-spent, bitcoin use a hash-based proof-of-work (please correct me if I’m correct with this especially)... so this is where the miners do their work.. their computers are the ones that solve the problem using proof-of-work and help approve that the transaction was indeed true, thus, creating the series of block chains, in exchange of this work, Bitcoin is rewarded or “created”.

As long as these chains continue, the possibility of hacking the transaction become close to impossible, that’s why this is important and thus explain why bitcoin is rewarded to the miners or there’s a gain of bitcoin every time a block is created.

Am I getting it right? or am I way off completely? 

Will really appreciate if you will explain this to me like I’m five because I don’t have that much knowledge in programming or deep computer words. I’ll try to understand every explanations that will be given. Thank you very much!

tl;dr every proof-of-work approved = bitcoin rewarded. Please correct if I’m wrong."

My question is: Which payment processors do the community like the most? BitPay seems easy but everyone here hates it. I understand why so many discourage it: They support BCH heavily and are custodial.... As a business owner, custodial can actually be ideal. As of the time of writing, the simplest way to accept crypto IMO is to use a third party that will take coins and fund the business bank account in dollars immediately. This is mostly just due to accounting and tax purposes. I want to run my business, I don't have time to dick around with payment technicals and legalities.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, who should I use?  


Note: For personal coins I 100% believe in ""not your keys, not your bitcoin"", for small businesses that just want to accept bitcoin without adding too much cost/time overhead, I think custodial processors (or processors that immediately convert BTC to Fiat are fine). This can easily be changed be simplifying (or removing :) tax laws, and by good accounting software in the coming years that integrates with wallets."

"Annotated notes from [Let's Talk Bitcoin Episode 389](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/lets-talk-bitcoin-389-revisiting-lightning-part-1). Taken from [Professor Meow](https://twitter.com/Sesame4Bitcoins/status/1099718417072807937) on Twitter

**Andreas Antonopolous**: My theory is that the way we're going to see Lightning being used is that people will have the vast majority of their funds on Lightning all the time. The only funds that are not on Lightning are the funds you keep in cold storage.

How do you make this jump between on-chain and off-chain? I need to open a channel in order to start using Lightning, but then I want to get my Bitcoin back, I would have to close the channel. I'm going to have to do this opening and closing channel not too infrequently. Maybe I'm opening and closing channels once a week or once a month, and if everybody needs to do the same, there's not enough capacity on the Bitcoin blockchain to do that. **That's the wrong way of looking at it because you're not going to be doing that.**

**That's where splicing comes in. What splicing allows you to do is blend the open channel, close channel and on-chain Bitcoin outputs into a single transaction.**

You're going to instead create a channel every time you do a Bitcoin transaction - there's no reason to take the change and put it back into an on-chain wallet.

Instead, you fund channels every time you do a Bitcoin transaction, and you can do a Bitcoin on-chain transaction every time you rebalance, close or open a channel, and combine all of those functions.
So a single transaction can have as its inputs the multi-sig of a closing channel, as its outputs the multi-sig of an opening channel, and an on-chain Bitcoin transaction.

**So you can basically splice Bitcoin into a channel, splice Bitcoin from a channel out onto the Bitcoin blockchain, and simultaneously open and close channels in the same transaction.**

**This allows you to send Bitcoin into a Lightning channel, send Bitcoin from Lightning out onto the Bitcoin network (make an on-chain Bitcoin payment), close the channel, and open a channel. All four things in one transaction simultaneously.**

Every Bitcoin transaction in which you're paying a fee becomes an opportunity to also open and close several channels and make other Bitcoin payments.

**Adam B. Levine**: Is the idea here just that users will be making transactions periodically and so this is a way to piggyback on existing traffic?

**Andreas Antonopoulos**: Bingo. Your wallet does all of this automatically. Depending on who you want to pay and whether they can be reached on-chain or off-chain to, your wallet constructs your transaction and piggybacks as many open and closed channels as it needs to. Rebalancing, other housekeeping duties, and minimize your fees by batching together.
**But wait, there’s more! The main reason we use Coinjoin is for obfuscation and privacy. But if you think about it, it also saves on transaction fees.**

If you're going to do that transaction anyway and you get five other strangers to join you and do their transactions, you pay one transaction fee across all of you. One transaction with five times the outputs is a lot cheaper than five transactions.

This makes even more sense if you have, for example, an exchange that is doing withdrawals or deposits onto lightning, and it has a whole bunch of customer withdrawals. You know, the classic batching problem that exchanges are trying to implement in order to save on fees.

**Adam B. Levine**: **So what you're saying here is that splicing has implications that extend beyond single people and really this is a technology that could be extended to improve privacy and obfuscation? Or do you see this being set up like Coinjoin where anyone can participate**?

"I saw few tweets from Elon Musk regarding Bitcoin.

As title mention, you have to remember that all their wealth is in fiat currencies. Entire business rely on banking systems.

They cannot talk too much because Bitcoin is against currencies and actual banking systems. If they talk too much, they risk to have troubles with their banks.

However, Elon Musk should be appreciated by his approach, although he cannot say too much, you have to give him credit for those few tweets. 

All those big figures like Bill Gates and others like him, they still use banking systems, they don't want to have troubles with banks at this moment.

What you have to understand if you read in between the lines of statements from those big figures is "" I cannot say too much, but go and get as much as you can Bitcoin"" 

Only few of them have the courage to say how important is blockchain in the future.

Look at the number of coins you have in wallet rather then how much value in fiat they have.

Hope you understand that Lightning Network made rest of coin almost useless."

"Hi all,

I have a strange occurrence which I need some help figuring out.

Yesterday I was checking on my various electrum wallets by putting my seeds into electrum. It was just a routine check to see they are there and everything is working.

My main wallets seed worked fine and showed the correct amount. Then I entered another seed I had written down and can't remember where it was from. Within that wallet was almost as much as my main wallet... Only there's no way I have collected this amount of BTC in total.

Now I think this stems from when I split my BTC for BCH last year out of the BCH electrum wallet. (I followed the electrum.org guide correctly with no problems).

My question is can two different seeds contain the same bitcoin? If I mixed these two wallets would I be in danger of corrupting or in some way losing my main BTC?

Sorry from the long post, I'm quite confused by this.."

"Has anybody used the bitcoin parity node in production?

This project seems to be far from ready.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently using bitcoin core and I need the following rpc endpoints to be working:

* sendRawTransaction  
* getRawTransaction   
* estimateSmartFee    
* getNetworkInfo      
* listUnspent         
* getTxOut            
* importAddress      

However, according to [issue #247 (JSON-RPC api)](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bitcoin/issues/247) most of them are not implemented yet:

    sendRawTransaction  =&gt; EXISTS
    getRawTransaction   =&gt; MISSING
    estimateSmartFee    =&gt; MISSING
    getNetworkInfo      =&gt; MISSING
    listUnspent         =&gt; MISSING
    getTxOut            =&gt; MISSING
    importAddress       =&gt; MISSING

I double-checked by searching their source-code, apparently a few have been implemented in the meanwhile:

    sendRawTransaction  =&gt; EXISTS
    getRawTransaction   =&gt; EXISTS
    estimateSmartFee    =&gt; MISSING
    getNetworkInfo      =&gt; MISSING
    listUnspent         =&gt; MISSING

*""Bad money (paper fiat) always chases out good money(bitcoin) from circulation""*

Meaning over the long term, bitcoin hodlers will prevail while those who hold fiat will ultimately perish in value as people spend their paper money while hodling bitcoin.

This phenomenon can be noticed in Roman times where they used close to pure silver coins known as Denarius for currency initially but debase their currency to pay for war and public works. Their debased coins were spent, while pure silver/gold coins were kept.

"Now that BTC block size is nearing it's limit again after Dec 2017 and Jan 2018 even during this bear market ( [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-size.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-size.html) ) would it be possible to change the BTC block size to a dynamic one? So e.g. when 1MB is getting full the code'd increase the block size to 2MB and if 2MB is getting full the code'd increase the block size again to the next magnitude of 4MB etc. Then again when tx traffic slows down and 4MB blocks are getting empty the code'd decrease the block size first to 2MB and if 2MB is also getting empty block size'd be decreased back to 1MB.

This way the preferred block size would always be the smallest possible but it would increase during the ""rush hours"" if needed. A solution between small and big blocks. Then the community doesn't have to childishly quarrel between small and big block size which only ends in stalemate situations. The code could simply automatically decide the thing for us. I think compromises have to be done in each front if consensus is the aim. No compromises and hard forks like in 2017 are inevitable. ""Only the Siths believe in absolutes""."

He learned of the bonanza from a fb and realized he was sitting on \~$1M-5M and subsequently rented a few clusters to crack his pw. Took him 4 months, but he was successful in the end. Now he's on an extended sabbatical though I feel his personal life is in turmoil.

"I did a write up for an article about the possible whereabouts of Satoshi Nakamoto. I have already written about Nick Szabo, Dorian Nakamoto, and Dave Kleiman. Im writing about Hal now and I thought you may enjoy it. 

  

Hal Finney

Hal Finney was quite influential in the beginning of Bitcoin. He received the first BTC transaction from “Satoshi Nakamoto”. But I am getting ahead of myself. Lets start at the beginning. Hal was born on May 4, 1956. He began his computer-centric career developing console video games. This really intrigued me, as I was a huge fan of console gaming back in the 80’s. Games like “Adventures of Tron (ironic I know), Armor Ambush, Space Attack, and space attack. Hal eventually left the console world to focus on cryptography. He became a developer for the PGP corporation (Which happened to be one of the first publicly available implementations of public-key cryptography) This allowed people to chat with each other via computer with encryption ensuring a secure connection. When you see the goal of PGP it is no wonder why Hal got involved with Bitcoin. He had been in cryptography for decades before Bitcoin was ever thought of. As a regular poster on the Cypherpunks mailing list. If you are a fan of cryptocurrency and you don’t know who or what “Cypherpunk” was I suggest you do a bit of research. These were the people that blazed the way for Bitcoin. I am quite certain that without this group of computer geniuses we would still be stuck with no other alternative than fiat. Fast forward to 2004 and you would witness the first creation of a reusable proof of work system. This predated Bitcoin by at least 5 years. This is one reason many folks believe Hal was in fact Satoshi Nakamoto. A statement that Hal repeatedly denied while he was alive. As far back as 1993 Hal was discussing a solution for solving the “double spend” issue that plagued the precursors to Bitcoin. Hal was a visionary, as he could see the issues cryptocurrency would face and started trying to solve them long before Bitcoin was ever implemented. Hal’s writing about “reusable proof of work” can be seen at the following link: [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/rpow/](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/rpow/). The actual website can be found here for Hal’s project (which is now terminated) [https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/index.html). Hal was a known cypherpunk for decades and when Bitcoin came along, it was natural for Hal to be involved. He has every qualification to claim the name Satoshi Nakamoto, that is for sure. But lets focus on what we do know about him. He actually lived in the same city as Dorian Nakamoto (I discussed him in my last write up “Part 1”) This added fuel to the flames that Hal or Dorian were Satoshi, and they may or may not have worked together. Of course, it is speculation, but it is interesting none the less. Hal and Satoshi communicated regularly through email about BTC and these emails are now a part of the history of BTC. Some claim Hal was actually emailing himself in order to hide his tracks and cover up the fact that Hal was actually Satoshi, which is possible. Hal was a giant in the cryptography and cryptocurrency fields. If I were to personally come out and call anyone Satoshi it would be Hal Finney (Just my personal opinion). The history of Bitcoin would be incomplete without mentioning Hal Finney. Sadly Hal contracted Lou Gehrig’s disease and decided to announce the diagnosis publicly in October 2009.  Even with death being a certainty Hal persisted and continued his work, even while using breathing assistance and being restricted to a wheelchair, until his death in August of 2014. His death was a blow to everyone that appreciated cryptography and knew of this brilliant mind. Hal selflessly sacrificed his time and efforts to ensure privacy would not disappear in the age of growing computer dominance. If you like Bitcoin, you should be thankful for Hal Finney. He was very influential in the creation of cryptocurrencies (Perhaps he was Satoshi) One thing we do know is we don’t know if it was Hal or not. Hal was a smart fella that could have very easily hidden his tracks. Hal was an advocate for privacy and for that I salute him. Thank you for your contributions Mr. Finney. Your legacy will live on through the next generation of developers you have inspired through your work. Rest in peace sir, your journey through life helped the world. We should all be thankful. "

I just noticed this morning that Gemini has quietly begun using bc1 Bech32 addresses for deposits.

"the reason why central banks target a 2% inflation rate is that people spend today and not tomorrow, since the people get more for their money today compared to when they leave it in the bank and use it in a year or so. Therefore the incentive is set to spend, leading to a stronger economy (atleast in theory).

Now, how can we expect people to use Bitcoin as a currency, thus spending it for goods, if:

1) there is no inflation in the future in BTC and the scarcity will drive the price up, holding people back from spending (hey, you need to spend less BTC on something tomorrow!)

2) there is no price stability (yet), therefore speculative and not usable as a store of value (hopefully this will change in the future)

How would this replace FIAT without slowing down the economy?

"***TLDR:*** *The appeal will take place on March 28th, 2019 at 2 pm.* [*https://twitter.com/A78gnstNYDFS/status/1105572458403368961*](https://twitter.com/A78gnstNYDFS/status/1105572458403368961)

*Contrary to criminal cases, a lawyer in an Article 78 doesn't have to accept the case.*

*When the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) promulgated the Bitlicense regulation in July 2015, a four month clock to submit a lawsuit starts. When I filed the lawsuit, I could not find a lawyer that knew bitcoin, even less file lawsuit. I filed the latest week possible in October 2015. It took 6 month for the State of New York to do a reply, and then another 6 month for my lawyer to understand it. The reason my lawyer took the case is that the State of New York sent me a reply of 26 pages.* ***A frivolous lawsuit answer is usually a few pages.***

*The arguments on the original lawsuit became so convoluted for everyone, including to the the judge that they all agree to start a brand new document and the Standing question was addressed.In May 2017, my lawyer rewrote the complaint, in June 2017 the State argue for the dismissal, we replied in July 2017, and in August 2017 we asked for discovery and in October 2017 we are in front of a new judge and she decided that I did not have standing.*

*(Someone who understand lawsuits - he has about 3,500 - explains what will happen:* [*https://youtu.be/CKvipt04g8s?t=13*](https://youtu.be/CKvipt04g8s?t=13)*)*

# Dear All,

**I received this analysis from one** of the group that wanted to file an Amicus Brief but their lawyer advised against. *I will keep the name of the firm hidden because it's doesn't add anything to the story.* Their analysis is worth discussing. The expertise needed in this case is **Administrative Law** but this firm expertise is in other areas.

&gt;According US News best law firms [*https://bestlawfirms.usnews.com*](https://bestlawfirms.usnews.com/), they are a **tier 1** in Bankruptcy and Creditor, Commercial Litigation and Bankruptcy *(in the New York and National categories.)*

**All I can say is that I see that their crypto unit depend on the Bitlicense to exist,** the first question I have is whether it make sense to them to advise that I am weak case? At the end of the day, the administrative question is simply whether I have the right to sue. **Do I have standing?**

In their analysis they write:

&gt;rather than its application, the four-month statute of limitations for Article 78 proceedings is not even applicable. *See Westhampton Beach Assoc., LLC v. Incorporated Village of Westhampton Beach*, 151 A.D.3d 793, 795 (2d Dep't 2017).

**But wait!** That analysis is based on a 2017 decision. I started my lawsuit in 2015 when that decision did not exist.

The only positive thing about that rule is that the four-month status of limitation is not applicable. According to that ruling of 2017, it's now six-year statute of limitations. **Anyone who was affected by the New York decision back in 2014 can potentially challenge the Bitlicense.**

Anyway, the appeal **oral arguments are scheduled for March 28, 2019 at 2:00 pm.** I hope this thread spark a good discussion.

# The analysis:

We have analyzed the Theo Chino appeal to determine what policy arguments might be addressed to support an amicus brief being submitted by YYYY on behalf of  the XXXX.  While we very much look forward to working with the XXXX to advance its policy objectives, we are concerned that the facts and  circumstances of the Theo Chino appeal are extremely weak and may be suboptimal for any amicus brief being filed on behalf of the XXXX. In particular, it appears that Theo Chino and his company lack standing to prosecute the appeal, and as a result, this appeal appears to not address any significant policy issues that we assume the XXXX is keen on advancing. We are of course available to discuss this further with the XXXX in the event there are any considerations that we may have overlooked.

In connection with our analysis, we have reviewed Appellants' opening brief, the Supreme Court's decision and order that was appealed from, and the parties’  briefing before the Supreme Court o the Defendants-Respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint and Article 78 petition for lack of  standing. We also have reviewed key legal authorities cited in Appellants' brief and the  briefing below on the motion to dismiss and conducted  some further independent research on the issues involved. Our preliminary conclusion is that, based on the factual circumstances of this case - in particular, the fact that the Plaintiffs-Appellants did not complete corporate entity's application to DFS or receive any determination that the challenged regulations even apply to  the business - the appeal is not meritorious and does not present an opportunity for a compelling amicus argument, public-policy oriented or otherwise.

**I.** **Factual and Procedural Background**

Theo Chino (""Theo"") and his company Chino Ltd. (""Chino"") challenge the DFS's ""virtual currency"" regulation (the ""Regulation""), which went into effect in June 2015 and, *inter alia*, required virtual currency businesses to acquire a license and abide by other mandates, such as maintenance of adequate books and records and minimum capitalization requirements. In 2013, prior to the enactment of the Regulation, Theo established  a small business to process Bitcoin payments on behalf of convenience stores. Upon the Regulation's enactment, Theo filed for a license under the Regulation on August 7, 2015.  He then initiated a pro se proceeding on October 16, 2015 challenging the  Regulation,  before receiving any response from DFS regarding his application. On  January 4, 2016, DFS returned the application stating that it could not be processed because it contained ""extremely limited"" information and, among other things, did not describe the business in which Chino was or would be engaged and did not specify in what  respect, if any, the business involve virtual currency. Thus, DFS explained that it could not determine whether Chino was subject to the  Regulation.  In response to the DFS letter, Theo discontinued Chino's Bitcoin-related services, although Chino continued as a non-operating business. Thereafter, Theo and Chino retained counsel, which filed an amended complaint and Article 78 petition challenging the Regulation. Defendants-Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of standing.

**II.** **Order Appealed From**

On these facts, the  Supreme Court, we think correctly, held that the Plaintiffs-Petitioners lacked standing both with respect to the Article 78 petition and the  challenge to the constitutionality of the Regulation. With respect to the Article 78 Petition, the Court observed that CPLR  7803(3) allows a petitioner to challenge ""whether a determination was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law  or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion"" and here, because DFS did not reach a decision on Chino's application, there is no ""determination"" for the Court to review. Moreover, the Court explained that a petitioner must exhaust available administrative remedies before permitted to litigate in a Court of law.  The Court considered the ""exceptions"" to this exhaustion principle, which Appellants claim in their appellate brief are applicable here, but determined that the exceptions are not applicable, again because of the petitioner's failure to complete the DFS application. Because of this failure, DFS did not take any action - constitutional or otherwise - that the petitioner could challenge in an Article 78 proceeding. With respect to the plaintiffs' standing on the constitutional challenge, the Court found this was a ""much closer issue,"" but again found that  plaintiffs lacked standing. This determination also came down to  plaintiffs' failure to complete the DFS application: the Court concluded  that the plaintiffs did not show ""injury in fact"" required  for standing because they did not properly apply for the DFS license required by the Regulation. The Court also rejected plaintiffs' economic loss argument because Chino never made a profit before the Regulation and its losses after enactment of the Regulation were consistent with its prior financial history. 

**III.** **Merits of the Appeal**

In their Appellate brief, the Appellants do not engage, at all, with the Court's  determination that their failure to complete an application for a  license under the Regulation or submit enough information to allow DFS to determine whether the Regulation applies to their business  deprives them of standing. Nor do the Appellants cite any authority that demonstrates that such a failure is not fatal to their standing. 

With respect to Article  78 standing, Appellants argue why each of the exceptions to the ""exhaustion"" principle apply to their action without addressing the fact  that, in the first instance, DFS never made a regulatory determination with respect to their business. Setting aside this threshold issue, the authority cited by the Appellants to support the applicability of these exceptions to their circumstances are extremely  weak.  On their argument that their action is excepted because DFS acted beyond its legislative power, they cite to *Bankers Trust*, which acknowledges this exception, but found that, in that case that  the relevant agency had acted within its statutory authority. For the constitutional exception, Appellants cite only to *Martinez 2001* and incorrectly state that, in that case, the First Department found that the exhaustion doctrine was inapplicable. In *Martinez 2001*, the First Department explicitly found that the exhaustion doctrine ***was*** applicable, stating that it was ""not convinced that  plaintiffs' procedural due process argument is the type of  unconstitutional agency action that is exempted from the exhaustion doctrine.""  *Martinez 2001 v. N.Y. City Campaign Fin. Bd.*, 36 A.D.3d 544,  548-49 (1st Dep't 2007).  The cases cited by Appellants on the futility exception are equally inapposite. In fact, *Lehigh*, seems to demonstrate why, under the circumstances here, exhaustion would not be futile. *Cf. Lehigh Portland Cement Co. v. N.Y. State Dep't of Environ. Conservation*, 87 N.Y.2d 136, 141 (1995) (finding exhaustion of administrative remedies futile where the agency had ""arrived at a ***definitive position*** which ***concretely affected*** the status of plaintiff's BUD petitions and then ***communicated that position*** to the plaintiff"" (emphasis added));  *see also N.Y. Inst. for Educ. of Blind v. United Federation Teachers' Comm.*,  83 A.D.2d 390 (1st Dep't 1981) (affirming dismissal of complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the Labor Relations Board had not passed on the issue of whether  the plaintiff was a ""public employer"" within the meaning of the  challenged regulation). Finally, with respect to the irreparable harm exception, Appellant's argument rests on the flawed assumption that the statute of limitations on their Article 78 challenge  would expire if they waited for DFS to make a decision on their application. It is the DFS's decision on the application, however, that would trigger the statute of limitations for the Article 78 proceeding, so there is no way that, in awaiting this decision, the statute of limitations for the Article 78 proceeding would expire. In fact, when challenging the actual substance of the regulation, as the Appellants do here, rather than its application, the four-month statute of limitations for Article 78 proceedings is not even applicable. *See Westhampton Beach Assoc., LLC v. Incorporated Village of Westhampton Beach*, 151 A.D.3d 793, 795 (2d Dep't 2017).

Appellants' argument that they can demonstrate ""injury in fact,"" as required to challenge the constitutionality of the Regulation, is equally problematic. Their argument here rests on the assumption that the Regulation applies to their business; but, as set forth above, DFS never made this determination. As Respondents pointed out in their motion to dismiss, Appellants voluntarily shut down the business before DFS processed Chino's application or issued any sort  of rejection, direction or mandate.  Thus, any injury to Appellants *was not caused by the Regulation*. Appellants also rely upon the $5,000 application fee and the costs of  compliance with the Regulation to support their claim of injury. As observed by the Court below, however, Appellants did not actually pay the $5,000 application fee (instead submitting a handwritten request for fee  waiver).  Moreover, as argued by the Respondents on their motion to  dismiss, Chinos never ascertained whether the business would need a license to operate under the Regulation, so any claim with respect to the cost of compliance is entirely speculative.

**IV.** **Considerations Relevant to a Potential Amicus Brief**

In light of the above,  we don't think that we want to submit an amicus brief in this action.  Issues related to the regulation of cryptocurrencies that have been percolating as of late (and are presumably of great interest to the XXXX) are not really implicated by this appeal. The issue here is of the Appellant's standing, and the Supreme Court's determination on this issue is based on the fact that, here, Appellants were not the subject of any DFS action or determination, rather than any legal principle that would  be applicable to other cryptocurrency businesses. The Supreme Court  did not address, and the appeal does not implicate, issues that would be  relevant to other cryptocurrency businesses other than the Appellants, such as (i) whether virtual currencies are a  financial product or service subject to regulation by DFS; (ii) whether the Regulation is arbitrary or capricious; or (iii) whether the  Regulation is preempted by Federal Law. Thus, we  do not see a public-policy/interest angle that we could compellingly  sponsor in this appeal."



"If I'm a user who does not want to *invest* in bitcoin, but just use it to buy stuff much as I use PayPal today, could it I'm ever the cause of one on-chain transaction?

I download a Lightning wallet and buy some bitcoin from an exchange who send it from their Lightning wallet to mine. I assume that would entail one on-chain transaction?

I then make purchases via LN, and top up my wallet via Loop or something similar when necessary. I never close my channel.

My understanding of Lightning is hazy so forgive me if I'm confused... But does the above work?"
"Here's an idea I've been thinking about. It would not require a hard fork to work but instead uses voluntary 0 fee transactions with the fees paid to miners in another unique way.


Here's how it would work generally 

-every so often a checkpoint is defined as perhaps the first block every week or month

-at the checkpoint the UTXO is hashed along with the block hash

-software that signals UTXO checkpoints would create transactions with no fees but instead have an output to the address with the private key being the hash described earlier, the amount paid would be the same as what the fee would have been (the hash computation would only have to be done periodically) 

-because everyone including the miner can calculate this hash they can sweep all the outputs when they create a block, if a miner doesn't, anyone can sweep it

-each block after the checkpoint would then contain many transactions that pay out to the same output and all appear to be 0 fee transactions

-light wallets would then see what percentage of transactions are voting for that UTXO set by getting all blocks after the checkpoint till the next checkpoint

-if a large enough margin of transactions are paid to special outputs the light wallet can be sure they are on the chain that is being used by the majority 

-it would seem attacks would be hard since the attacker would have to have more transactions in the blocks than the economic majority for a long period after the checkpoint 

-perhaps spam attacks would be easy to spot as there would be two competing UTXO sets being voted on and the software would wait for more certainty

-software that votes erroneously would be ignored as the hash would be unknown so all those votes would be swept by non miners or only certain miners colluding


If most transactions were done this way, it would appear light clients could measure how true a UTXO set is likely to be based on measuring transactions contained in the blocks.

"I don't understand the technical reason why if I have a channel with a balance in my favour it isn't possible to send a small amount of that balance to someone who doesnt currently have any channels open with anyone without having to broadcast an on-chain tx. Can't an offchain txo with a promise for some of my balance be created? With the same terms about broadcasting a tx to claim funds from my channel in the event of an old state being broadcast by me? Obviously an on-chain tx will be needed eventually to export any balance. Is it because a 3 way channel presently causes issues if one person closes it unilaterally? Is there any theoretical way a three way channel as described can be created and a single persons choice to unilaterally close the channel could leave the other 2 people unaffected?

"I’ve read plenty of speculation that futures markets are used to drive down the price of a commodity, whether it’s gold or bitcoin. People point to bitcoin futures being introduced in December 2017 and the price immediately falling, as an example of this. We will know in three years if this is true if we don’t see another bullrun, especially after the halving. Then bitcoin is no longer cyclical in its growth, and something else is affecting price. 

What are good arguments against this line of thinking?"

"Does Bakkt partnering up with Starbucks make sense to anyone? Other than a marketing angle, IMO, the Starbucks stores will provide little value to help create actual bitcoin usage. 

\- the idea of tens of thousands of $5 coffee purchases using bitcoin is horrendous (network clog, fees go up, etc.)

\- i assume the first point because there is no media mention of Lightning Network

\- why is LN not in the picture?

\- unless Starbucks discounts the coffee if crypto is used, mainstream will NOT use crypto to buy coffee

How can anyone tell the difference between me collecting bitcoins for years compared to me just getting it all on that one day? I don't use any exchanges. Just my trezor.

(source: https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)

----------------------
Bitcoin’s biggest problem is not even its massive energy consumption, but that the network is mostly fueled by coal-fired power plants in China. Coal-based electricity is available at very low rates in this country. Even with a conservative emission factor, this results in an extreme carbon footprint for each unique Bitcoin transaction.

Additional research published in Nature Climate Change (October 2018) even suggested that Bitcoin mining alone could push global warning “above 2 °C within less than three decades“.

Here is my logic.

You have a 1 BTC physical casascius and with the premium it is worth say 1.6 BTC today.

For this example pretend the dollar stays stable in value. In 100 years the price of bitcoin has risen dramatically. 1 BTC can buy a house. The coin still has 1 BTC of worth plus its premium, say 100k USD. Since the price of bitcoin is so high that large premium translates to say 0.1 bitcoin.

So the coin is only sellable for 1.1 bitcoin.

"Not sure why someone flagged this as begging but, you can find this on GoFundMe. Im not sure if it's ok to post link seeing as the other was ""flagged"" but you can use search. She needs help and since people can send low amounts that's why I figured I would reach out to the Bitcoin community for help. At least vote to move if not in a proper category. She needs all the help possible and I had to make a new account to post this after posting it 5 minutes ago. No one is begging this is a ask for help for Stephanie. It is very disturbing seeing how some people could help her but, someone flagged so they couldn't even see it. Wonder if it was there child in her predicament if they would flag a whole community that came together to write what's below. I wish there was a option on GoFundMe for Bitcoin because a few asked us about it but anyways thank you and below is what the Erie Community came together to write.

I am posting this on a few Bitcoin forums so we can get help for our dear friend Stephanie. Currently she had a death of a child and cannot afford funeral expenses for her daughter.

As of today we had raised around 500$ from local businesses in our area from collection jars and around 68$ on GoFundMe. Stephanie was a married stay at home mother of three before loosing her husband last year to a drunk driver. She has two children now and works 2 separate jobs trying to support them and barely making monthly rent. Stephanie's beautiful daughter ashley, age 11, past away on February 18th, 2019. Ashley reminded all of us how fun our child hood was in Erie. It was a tremendous loss when she left our community. To help Stephanie is our last chance to do something to show Ashley how much we loved her.

Anything will help Stephanie and all the money received will go towards the funeral expenses. If, any money is left over, it will go to supporting her family. Stephanie knows that her hometown community has been taking donations for her but, she keeps going to work and not taking the time off needed. We personally think she should be taking all the time she needs to get the support desperately needed thats why our community is doing everything we can to try and make things easier for her.

We are using coinbase so, all bitcoin will be converted into cash an then withdrawaled into a PayPal account for Stephanie.

Please,  If you can donate even 1$, .50¢ please send to: 

3JyhWXsx2imJ8bpuShYcmFVuv8NSBfbueX 

God Bless, Erie Community

Bitcoin transaction will be converted at night every few days and, added in together as one total to the GoFundMe Page. Donation will say Sent from ""Bitcoin Community"".

Again, thank you and we will update this post every few days or so. If you would like to add your name to the donations, please send a message. God Bless - The Erie Community

If it's considered begging then I'm sorry. I guess we will put the option on the GoFundMe hoping the account isn't closed off but, that's why we wrote it here."

"People always talk about how gold is ""God's money"". That sounds great and all, but how can you confirm that God actually claims gold as being his money? there's no way to confirm that he owns / ever did own gold..

Now imagine what the price of gold would be if you could confirm that God (Feel free to insert whoever your God happens to be) in fact did and still does own the lion's share of the total gold supply and no mortal man was able to touch it ever. The price would skyrocket!

My point is, If you have a problem with the fact that satoshi holds 1 million BTC, my rebuttal would it's the only way to prove the creator of the currency truly believes in his creation. "

"Hoping to open up a discussion about occurrences of local hyperinflation and Bitcoin.

Personally I would like to counter those pushing the ""my groceries will cost $9,999 by the time BTC hits US$1,000,000"" argument.

Here is my view:

Firstly hyperinflation generally does not happen to every currency simaltaneously.

Countries that mismanage their economies pick themselves off one by one when their dumpster fires gradually/inevitably get out of control.

Your local cash then loses all purchasing power, but your Bitcoin does not. 
This in itself does not increase Bitcoins global purchasing power, but when members of those individual economies are trying to figure out a way to preserve the value of their hard earned money where will they put it?

"Hi guy, 

So I’m playing on the idea of setting up a BTC ATM in the area I live. I’m from a very small island in the UK where there isn’t any to date and I believe there to be a great market for it.

My question is, do you need some sort of licence to set up this kind of business? I read online of people being arrested in the USA for selling BTC and resulting in being done for money laundering. That isn’t my end goal.

 I love the idea that this would work for me but I’m sure it’s no where as easy as it seems. 

Thank you in advance for any replies.

Cheers! "

"Bitcoin BTC has global brand recognition, and is now valued at over $69 Billion, which is more than the other top 30 Alt-coins combined.

Currently, Bitcoin BTC is the most widely used peer-to-peer cash, with a 24 hour trading volume of $11 Billion, which is greater than the other Alt-coins in the top 5 combined.

It's going to be very difficult to move all those users to start trading over to a new blockchain, as the vast majority of exchanges have been built around using Bitcoin as the main part of the trading pairs. You could argue that Bitcoin is already the medium of exchange and unit of account for the vast majority of crypto traders.

Bitcoin BTC is constantly improving, with 50 developers contributing to improving its open source software, every month.

There is a growing feedback loop too, as the more people “hodl” Bitcoin BTC, the more valuable it becomes, and as more traders use Bitcoin BTC for trading, the more liquid it becomes.

Bitcoin layer 2 solutions are also growing in leaps and bounds.

The Lightning Network, only recently celebrating its 1 year anniversary, is ideal for low value payments, and machine to machine payments, offering instant transactions at just $0.00000000004 per transaction fee.

Bitcoins Liquid was built to address the particular needs of traders who use exchanges to trade Alt-coins. Liquid provides fast 2 minute transfers on layer 2, which are ideal for traders that want to take fast advantage of trading and arbitrage opportunities.

With the best security, highest market cap, exciting layer 2 solutions, and the greatest liquidity, Bitcoin BTC is poised well, to become the long term winner in crypto.

I wanted to test the function and transferred a small amount of bitcoin to my address. After it arrived half of it WAS gone, as planned. However, I do not have any channels open, according to my Raspiblitz. Does opening channels simply take a while or did something bug out and take my money?

Note that in Feb 2019, the Total Value issued was 1,210,772,383,165 for the bank notes (coins are too small let's ignore these for now). A year prior, Feb 2018 this number was 1,147,370,429,555. This is a yearly growth of **5.5%**.

Yet, the inflation rate as shown here for example https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi has been around **2%** for the entire history of the euro (since 1999).

"I've been using wirex cards for a few years now without problems, until recently. Around 2 weeks ago, my account was locked without reason, with a message telling me to email support. I did, they requested ID verification. That's when the delay tactics started, they kept refusing to accept various random details to ""prove it was me"". This back and forth lasted for about a week, until they asked me to email them a selfie of me holding me my passport - twice in a row (had to be a different picture) - after which I told them my timezone and to email me the reset password link while I was awake...

They emailed to me specifically during a time when I wasn't awake, and the link expires within an hour, so obviously I was never able to click it.

I'm still without access to my account, because when I asked them to resend me the link, *they started the entire verification process from scratch***,** despite them already approving my documents.

At this point, it's either extreme incompetence or malice from their part, but either way, I would advise everyone to avoid this company from now on and if you have an account with them, withdraw all the coins/cash while you still can. Personally, I lost about 500-1000 usd, and at this point I'm not expecting to get it back. It's a shame, seems like there are no good debit cards left at the moment?"

I haven't made my opinion on this topic, trying to understand his argument. This part of bitcoin is not something I understand very well. His main argument is about using this kind of light wallet gives the miner too much power. He specifically mentions dangerous level of 95% of users using light wallets of this kind. My question here is, does the argument hold in case there are many full nodes that are still validating the consensus, let's say 100,000 full nodes but it is still just 5% of users compared to light wallet users. What I don't understand is how in such a situation those wallets actually rely on miners if they are connected to random full node and it is very like the that such full node has nothing to do with any kind of miner.

In such a scenario, the block still needs to go to the network. The vast majority of the network would reject bad block. Therefore you would have to be very unlucky to have your wallet connected to such a node that accepted the block. Moreover, such notes would be banned by the majority of the network and so their address would not even be announced to other nodes. How does this make the light wallet user vulnerable except for small chance bad luck scenario?

The contract is open-ended.

determined by three factors: difficulty of operation, Bitcoin exchange rates against USD and maintenance costs (which includes all electricity, cooling, development and maintenance costs). We can not control the first two factors that are unpredictable,

[https://nuvoo.io/fr/faqs/The](https://isolate.menlosecurity.com/1/3735928037/https:/nuvoo.io/fr/faqs/The) specific duration of a contract of indefinite duration is variable and determined by three factors: the difficulty of the exploitation, the Bitcoin exchange rates against USD and the maintenance costs of 0.00021 $ / 1gh / s of the pool 1 to 24 (This includes all costs for electricity, cooling, development and maintenance). We can not control the first two factors that are unpredictable, but we always deploy the latest mining technology, and do our best to keep them running at their peak for you. In the event that a contract becomes unprofitable (ie, the payment can not cover maintenance costs), the resulting daily payment will be nil. After that, the contract will continue for 21 days. This means that we will take care of maintenance costs in the hope that your contract becomes profitable again. This can occur if the mining network difficulty decreases and / or the Bitcoin price increases. If the contract does not return to profitability during this period, it will be completed because the extraction machines consume resources (electricity, air conditioning, accommodation, maintenance, etc.) that can not be paid with their generated payments.Malgres waiting more than 21 days your contract is not profitable income. An option will be added soon for a manual removal of your accumulated BTC. If you have questions or if you need immediate assistance, do not hesitate to contact us by chat or send us a ticket.

the fact that the function is not available now is theft

the fact I wasnt notified of the closure of my countract is a breach of contract

do you not understand how bad this would look in front of a Canadian judge

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:22:19 am

I understand sir but I can't faster the programmer because I'm not a programmer.

So When the function will be work you will be able to withdraw your btc

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that my contract was closed in december and its now march and this is the first I have found out about this is unacceptable

I have been left thinking it was still mining that whole time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:23:41 am

Is on the contract and the terms and conditions

For the explain of the open-ended

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:24:01 am

I understand that but the contract also says that you would notify me of the discontinuation of the contract

which you didnt

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:24:49 am

And you don't go on your account before that? I don't know why you don't received an email.

Can I help you with anything else?

And your contract is not ended, Ison standby for the market we analyse the market

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:29:04 am

My contract states ""The Customer shall receive Mined Parts in accordance with the Mining Power contracted and the applicable Fees""

Thats directly from your contact

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:29:19 am

As I explain you

We work a function to withdraw your BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:29:44 am

by my inability to remove my parts, you are in violation of our mutually agreed contract

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:29:49 am

I don't have any date for activated the function

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:30:16 am

""we work a function to withdraw your btc"" isnt proper english

I don't care that you ""people"" are working on it

its in clear violation of my contract

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:31:25 am

We are working on the withdrawal function for your accumulated BTCs. As long as the function is not ready we can not withdraw. Programmers are working on it right now.

If isn't ready I can't make more faster sorry about that and I understand your feeling.

Yes in the bank if I deposit a check the bank can make a freeze on the check And I'll not have all the money

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:32:49 am

So imagine this, you go to the bank and ask the bank to withdraw money from your account and the bank teller tells you, ""sorry we dont have a function to withdraw your money.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:33:26 am

Sir I explain you many times and is the message I received by the Senior. I can't tell you anything else. I have this information. I'm a agent not a senior or supervisor

I already deposited a check and all the money was frozen

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:34:27 am

Difference is in the blockchain its already been verified

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:34:43 am

Okay sir I just have this information

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:34:51 am

And not my concern is if you shudder as a company, my money is gone

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:35:01 am

So I can't tell you more information. Because I don't have any other information

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:35:16 am

So here's what you are going to do, you're going to transfer my BTC to my wallet.

Why, because its already been confirmed by the blockchain as having occured

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:35:57 am

When the function will be ready we will send you your btc

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:36:36 am

By the fact that you are hiding from that makes it appear to me that this is a ponzy scheme

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Karine G.

08:36:53 am

Sir I don't have any other information i can give you I don'T have it

Can I help you with anything else?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Me

08:37:07 am

And now with the siginificant drop in BTC price, you dont have the BTC sitting there that you ""mined""

Yes you can get me someone who will transfer my bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"I like looking at the numbers.
Every now and then I check usdebtclock.org

These numbers are staggering.
This year the US will have to pay more than 350 billion ON INTEREST ALONE..
Please let it sink in that the market cap of BTC is just 70 billion.

If this amount of money, that has to be paid every year and will only increase, would flow into BTC this year the price would, at least, 5 fold, from 4000 to 20000.

This is just the yearly interest payments of the US alone.

Fiat is slowly, wel not so slow in fact, imploding.
There are just a few real escapes available.
Realize BTC is one of the most compelling.

"I just wanted to share something what i did today and somehow i am proud on that. 
Today, my sisters son is 1 year old and last few months everyone thinking what to buy him for a birthday.
Well, on the end after all said what they gona buy, i decide to buy him some btc (0.03 to be precise).
Of course, everyone think that i am crazy and oldest in a family can't understand what i am talking about.  
But when i look that little man i said to my self ""now he is   owner of btc"". Him and me in my family. 
And feeling is great and for some reason i am proud on that. 
I truly believe in btc and crypto in general and comments like ""whay don't you buy him something normal"" are funny to me and make me to lough.
It's funny to watch reactions of people who don't have any idea what btc is.
One day that 0.03 btc maybe will worth nothing, but maybe it will worth couple thousands. Who knows?
But, i would love to see their faces if/when btc goes up.
Can't wait FOMO to start in my family, it will be so fun."

"I have a question about the Double spending Problem.

Lets say we have a Blockchain with Block#300 being the latest one and lets say that Bob tries to do a Double spend.

Lets say he's lucky enough to find Block#301 quite fast and doenst send it to the other miners

Now he's doing his double spend transaction and buying f.ex a cup of coffee and this transaction is transmitted to the network where it will be included in Block#301 of the Rest of the Network

Now Bob mines locally his Block#302, again without the coffe transaction and has now the longest chain and transmit his Block#301 and Block#302 to the Network.

So Bob did a Double spend because he has a Coffee now and havent payed for it.
Thats the scenario I learned so far.

But when the whole Network receives Bobs 2 Blocks, won't the miners try to mine the coffee transaction into the next Block, because the transaction is not yet included in the Blockchain.

So in the end the transaction will be in in Block#303 Or Block#304 again and Bob hasn't have done a Double spend.

So my question is: will the Coffee transaction be mined afterwards again or not after they get Bobs 2 Blocks. "

"This is a story which happened to me around 3 weeks ago. Since then I've been talking to blockchain's customer support trying to resolve the issue and possibly get a refund - with no success. So let's get into it:

At the beginning of February I decided to €300 from my €340 wallet through integrated Coinify panel on blockchain. I put the amount, accepted the fee and waited. Please note that **the ONLY** fee I was shown was the €0.75 which you may see on the picture below (sounds reasonable right?).

[https://i.imgur.com/TxC50D4.png](https://i.imgur.com/TxC50D4.png)

After few seconds I realized that the whole €340 went missing. I double checked the order history and saw this:

[https://i.imgur.com/205GGeR.png](https://i.imgur.com/205GGeR.png)

Crazy right? Blockchain.com **set the transaction fee to 1000 sat/byte** without a single statement/message while making the order. Keep in mind that the 'normal' network transaction fee lies around 50 sat/byte. This one is 20x higher. **The only additional fee I was presented** was this €0.75. I would never sold those bitcoins if I knew that it would have costed me 1/7th of my whole wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

*1st response from customer support (1 day wait time):*  
[https://i.imgur.com/DDGfKYy.png](https://i.imgur.com/DDGfKYy.png)

To this I replied that I didn't purchase any BTC but rather sold it and waited again (didn't understood my 1st message?).

&amp;#x200B;

*2nd response from customer support (5 days wait time):*  
[https://i.imgur.com/5ebYNmK.png](https://i.imgur.com/5ebYNmK.png)

Issue escalated to Coinfiy... right.. (I was pretty sure that network fee has been set by [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) and that's why I contacted them instead of Coinify)

*1st and last response from Coinify customer support (1 day wait time):*

&amp;#x200B;

Original Post from u/Luka_Magnotta

## I am a time-traveler from the future, here to beg you to stop what you are doing.

I am sending this message from the year 2025. Things are looking bleak here, and some of you will carry blood on your hands.

If you don't believe me, please move on, as I have no way of proving to you I'm really who I claim to be.

I don't want to waste any of your time, so I'm merely going to explain what happened.

On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency.

There are just over 19 million Bitcoin known to be used in the world today, as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost, and we're still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today. On average, this means the average person owns just under 0.003 bitcoin. However, due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world, the *mean* person owns just 0.001 bitcoin. That's right, most of you reading this today are rich. I personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old Reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0.01 Bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a ""faggot"" when he was a 16 year old boy. Upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket, left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a Citadel.

""What is a Citadel?"" you might wonder. Well, by the time Bitcoin became worth 1,000 dollar, services began to emerge for the ""Bitcoin rich"" to protect themselves as well as their wealth. It started with expensive safes, then began to include bodyguards, and today, ""earlies"" (our term for early adapters), as well as those rich whose wealth survived the ""transition"" live in isolated gated cities called Citadels, where most work is automated. Most such Citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where Bitcoin mining machines are located. The company known as ASICminer to you is known to me as a city where Mr. Friedman rules as a king.

In my world, soon to be your world, most governments no longer exist, as Bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens. Most of the success of Bitcoin is due to the fact that Bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government. Whereas people entering ""rogue states"" like Luxemberg, Monaco and Liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth, no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in Bitcoin.

Governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying Bitcoin, which just made the problem worse, by increasing the value of Bitcoin. Governments did so in secret of course, but my generation's ""Snowdens"" are in fact greedy government employees who transferred Bitcoin to their own private account, and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money.

The four institutions with the largest still accessible Bitcoin balance are believed to be as following:

\-ASICminer - 50,000 Bitcoin

\-The IMF's ""currency stabilization fund"" - 70,000 Bitcoin

\-Government of Saudi Arabia - 110,000 Bitcoin

\-The North Korean government - 180,000 Bitcoin

Economic growth today is about -2% per year. Why is this? If you own more than 0.01 Bitcoin, chances are you don't do anything with your money. There is no inflation, and thus no incentive to invest your money. Just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth, as wealth was measured in gold, our society has no economic growth either, as people know their 0.01 Bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime. The fact that there are still new Bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems, but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy.

What happened to the Winklevoss twins? The Winklevoss twins were among the first to die. After seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society, terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of Bitcoin, or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency. Ironically, these terrorist movements use Bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations.

Most people who own any significant amount of Bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends, because they had to change their identities. There have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag-holders, the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse, even after hearing the rumors of governments buying Bitcoin. Many people were taken hostage, and thus, it is suspected that 25% percent of ""Bitcoin rich"" actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password.

Why didn't we abandon Bitcoin, and move to another system? Well, we tried of course. We tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency, but nobody with an IQ above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer. After all, why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline? The thing that made Bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful. Bitcoin allows us to give into our greed.

In Africa, surveys show that an estimated 70% of people believe that Bitcoin was invented by the devil himself. There's a reason for this. It's a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as ""the tragedy"". The African Union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to Bitcoin. Governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free, tied to their government ID, and thus government sought to integrate Bitcoin into their economy. All went well, until ""the tragedy"" that is. A criminal organization, believed to be located in Russia, exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones. It's believed that the entire continent of Africa lost an estimated 60% of its wealth in a period of 48 hours. What followed was a period of chaos and civil war, until the Saudi Arabian and North Korean governments, two of the world's major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system's unique ability to adapt to the ""Bitcoin challenge"", divided most African land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local African population for it.

You might wonder, what is our plan now? It's clear that the current situation can not be sustained, without ending in a nuclear holocaust. I am part of an underground network, who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the Internet itself. We have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines, which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents. After this has been successfully achieved, we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world. We believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world's population to rise up in revolt, and destroy as many computers out there as possible, until we reach the point where Bitcoin loses any relevance.

Of course, this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths. This is a price we are forced to pay, to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite.

This is also the reason we contacted you.

It doesn't have to be like this. You do not have to share our fate. I don't know how, but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy. I know this is a difficult thing to ask of you. You believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies.

However, I have seen where it ends."

V SYSTEMS coin sale will be launched on 27 March 2019.

A coin sale partnership is organized with an exchange platform acting as intermediary between the token issuer and interested contributors. Unlike traditional token sales which usually involve complicated on-chain transactions, contributors can simply register an account on the exchange and buy the token directly from the exchange platform. Many leading exchanges including Binance, OkEx and Huobi have already launched dedicated LaunchPad programs. BitTorrent recently held an LaunchPad with Binance Launchpad and successfully raised US $7.2 million in around 18 minutes.

Given the stake on reputation, exchanges usually perform strict due diligence and select only promising ventures to partner for a coin sale partnership. By partnering with one of the top 10 exchanges in the world, V SYSTEMS has received yet another strong signal of trust from the cryptocurrency community, after having [listed its VSYS Coin](https://medium.com/vsystems/v-systems-lists-vsys-coin-on-bitfinex-kucoin-and-bitforex-2ccb76bfdc4e) on top exchanges including Bitfinex and KuCoin earlier this year.

V SYSTEMS is a blockchain database cloud project led by Sunny King, the creator of Proof of Stake consensus. The project will deliver the world’s first object-oriented general purpose distributed database, which is empowered to carry complex decentralized applications. By utilizing its newly developed Supernode Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus mechanism, V SYSTEMS is building a platform to deliver cost-effective, scalable and easy-to-develop blockchains.

Speaking on the partnership, CEO of V SYSTEMS, Dr Alex Yang, said, “We’re honored to partner with ZB.com, ZBG and BW for the coin sale. Removing the entry barrier will be a major step in pushing forward the materialization of Sunny King’s vision. We envision the partnership to not only encourage the adoption of VSYS Coin, but also further promote the coin leasing functionality where coin holders simultaneously govern the blockchain and earn minting rewards as incentives.”

V SYSTEMS coin sale is set to launch on 27 March, with a supply of 45 million VSYS Coins on ZB.com, ZBG and BW LaunchPads.

**About V SYSTEMS**

V SYSTEMS is a blockchain database cloud project led by Sunny King, the inventor of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. By delivering Supernode Proof of Stake (SPoS), the next step in freeing consensus from Proof of Work’s costly link to energy consumption, V SYSTEMS is building a platform to deliver cost-effective, scalable and easy-to-develop blockchains.

In addition to SPoS, V SYSTEMS is focused on three further pillars of development toward universal scalable blockchains: decentralized full-featured databases for storing object-oriented data; cloud and modular tools to enable developers to create custom blockchains efficiently; and VSYS Coins, which enable participation in the V SYSTEMS platform development process by providing access to network services and incentives. The project will deliver the world’s first object-oriented general purpose decentralized database to carry complex decentralized applications.

"Hello friends, I am looking for people interested in participating in a challenge which is rewarded with bitcoins. If you do not know what one of these challenges is, they are usually images that have different messages hidden or things which if you manage to solve you can recover a btc wallet which you can keep. I am not the creator, the creator is an early adopter of bitcoin and I want to form a team to solve it, the reward would be divided equally. The people that I look for should not have a knowledge of something special more than bitcoin, if they know about cryptography and programming in some better scripting language, but the main thing is to be perseverant, honest and creative. If someone is interested in forming a team with me, you can talk to me. Thank you"

"How can blockchain technology ensure a clearing completely without a middleman? Let me give you an example what could be replaced in future: Today you buy something on Ebay, you get the article really delivered and Paypal releases your payment. After a while you realize that the article has a failure. With a middleman like Paypal you can still claim to get your money back, they will coordinate it for you. Another example is a credit card fraud. In most cases I will get my money back from the credit card company. My conclusion is that I still need an instance to clear such cases or am I wrong?"

Our database has been compromised, including your email. We are working on a  
quick resolution and to begin with, your password has been disabled as a  
security measure (and you will need to reset it to login again on Mt.Gox).  


If you were using the same password on Mt.Gox and other places (email, etc),  
you should change this password as soon as possible.  


For more details, please see this:  


[https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollback](https://support.mtgox.com/entries/20208066-huge-bitcoin-sell-off-due-to-a-compromised-account-rollback)  


The informations there will be updated as our investigation progresses.  


Please accept our apologies for the troubles caused, and be certain we will do  
everything we can to keep the funds entrusted with us as secure as possible.  


The leaked data includes the following:  


\- Account number  
\- Account login  
\- Email address  
\- Encrypted password  


While the password is encrypted, it is possible to bruteforce most passwords  
with time, and it is likely bad people are working on this right now.  


Any unauthorized access done to any account you own (email, mtgox, etc) should  
be reported to the appropriate authorities in your country.  


Thanks,

"Regulators are intentionally acting slowly out of a sense of caution and the net effect is to strangle a growing market and innovation within the market.  They want to appear to be trying to protect investors from loss by being ultra meticulous when no one really knows how the market will develop.

"Monday (February 18) quoted Finance Magnates as reporting that a series of bitcoin-traded open-end index fund ETFs are still awaiting lengthy approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

&amp;#x200B;

Although regulators are not willing to apply for several ETFs, they do not give any reason behind them.

&amp;#x200B;

In a bipartisan policy center event called ""Capital Market Outlook for the Year"" last week, two US market regulators, the Securities and Futures Commission SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC exchanged ideas on Bitcoin futures and ETF markets. .

&amp;#x200B;

In the SEC's position, SEC Chairman Hester Peirce said that the SEC has been reluctant to sign the Bitcoin ETF, and personal concerns that the field is now much like an advantage to judge the current bitcoin market.

&amp;#x200B;

In the existing virtual currency market regulatory environment, Peirce said that there are still many markets that are not regulated, but we are still building products on top of it. This is considered to be very cautious behind these reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

The SEC has rejected major market players in the past, including bitcoin ETFs applied by the CBOE and Winklevoss brothers on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. CBOE recently submitted another application and is currently awaiting evaluation.

&amp;#x200B;

CFTC Chairman Brian Quintenz gave a different point of view, saying, ""We have a procedure in the Commodity Trading Act that allows the Exchange to meet the requirements of the Act in a confident certification contract.""

&amp;#x200B;

Quintenz stated that the CFTC had a period of evaluation before. If the CFTC disagreed with the application, the content of the bill explained the reason, but if there is no disagreement, these institutions have the opportunity to certify the contract themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Both CBOE and the Chicago Merchandise Commission CME Group are pursuing the process of self-certification, so these contracts can be listed without approval, and of course, without our approval.

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, CBOE and CME Group launched bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, which once pushed up the price of digital assets to the peak of history, but since then virtual currency, especially bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline, bitcoin Asset prices fell by more than 80%.

&amp;#x200B;

As FM reported earlier this month, the Bitcoin futures market suffered a setback in September last year, and the trading volume dropped dramatically.

&amp;#x200B;

There is still a battle for virtual currency sites between the SEC and the CFTC. Although the CFTC has taken over the rights of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the SEC is still controlling the larger ICO market.

&amp;#x200B;

Quintenz said in explaining the difference between goods and securities, ""We only have the right to judge fraud and law enforcement in the commodity field, and the regulatory jurisdiction is in the field of commodity derivatives trading. Therefore, we do not have the own transactions of commodities such as ebay. Regulatory power.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also because of this lack of authority that I suggest that these platforms can form a self-regulatory structure together to discuss, negotiate, implement, and better expect to review or internal audit. ”

&amp;#x200B;

In clarifying the current position on the virtual currency regulatory environment, Peirce stated that the market environment was too confusing and also offered a suggestion that the CFTC and the SEC should cooperate in this area.

Yes! i'm a very persistant bastard

the core of the multiprocesser is written using Python code, not Qt code. No matter what i've done the multiprocesser crashes sometimes. I think it's the sync'ing between the Python code and the Qt code.

Have been just emitting a signal when: task done, task failed, multiprocesser done, or a crash (which never occurs). Instead i'll  use Qt postEvent. And experiment with that to see if can eliminate the unreliability.

The QThread code looks picture perfect. The processes made by the multiprocesser have been renamed from multiprocesser -&gt; Leaky bitch. Until i can see some improvements in stability and reliability"

He offers a VAT (value added tax) on Technology companies to pay for it. He compares this to Alaska's annual dividend to it's citizens which has been ongoing for 37 years and is funded by taxes on the Oil industry.

Yang proposes a ""Freedom Dividend"" of $1000/month ($12k/year) to all citizens over 18 (you must opt in to the program and it does not stack on existing government benefits). No strings attached on the monthly deposits. 

At today's rate,  that is over 3 BTC per year. Yes,  please.

"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a multilingual blogging platform called Literatus ([https://literatus.org](https://literatus.org)) which is in open-alpha phase at the moment. Similarly with [Yours.org](https://Yours.org) and [Yalls.org](https://Yalls.org), there is a paywall feature that means users have to pay to read the rest of the content if an author set a price for his post.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you don't judge me about this, currently it utilizes Bitcoin SV for payments. I'm looking for more opportunities and possibilites. So, I'm interested in implementing LN payments and have some questions about it. Hope you help me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this a good use case for LN?
2. How hard to implement lightning payments into such a site? I'll be glad if you give me some ""best practice"" links.
3. What is the success rate where the price is &lt; $5 and &gt; $5 for LN payments? Is there a statistical data for this kind of stuff?
4. Should I do something else regularly after opening a channel once, like refunding channel the on a daily basis with at least the same amount of funds with the latest user deposits? Btw, is it possible to refund the channel or should I close and open another one?
5. Is there a custodial service like BitPay that does the heavy stuff in behalf of me but doesn't require legal documents?
6. I read some posts about losing funds because of broadcasting an old state of the channel after a node crash by an accident. What is the best practice to avoid such a scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

In recent years, the development speed of the blockchain industry has burned like a raging fire, sweeping across the various industries and all walks of life from the south to the north.

Many investors, with their sly eyes and eager mood, look forward to getting the millet in the fire. Regardless of the professional and life background, people have been completely activated by the suddenly rich effect of Bitcoin, and they are afraid to miss the opportunity of blockchain to make a fortune.

📷 

With the popularity of the blockchain, any industry that is tied to the blockchain is a hot spot in the market.

However, many people think that blockchain is equivalent to bitcoin, and blockchain is bitcoin. This kind of thinking has existed for several years. After this year's bitcoin crash, many people understand that the blockchain is only the underlying technology of Bitcoin, it is not bitcoin, and the value of the blockchain is much higher than that of Bitcoin.

Nowadays, the blockchain industry is slowly developing and the country's supervision is becoming more and more strict.

Therefore, the development of the blockchain is finally on the right track; the prevalence of the blockchain has made people's understanding of the blockchain more and more thorough; the government's supervision has made the development of the blockchain more and more compliant!

Subsequently, the giants piled up to enter the field of blockchain, the technology of the blockchain became the mainstream!

📷 

AtoX is a recent project based on Blockchain 4.0 technology with the rise of the east wind of the times.

AtoX has the advantages of AI enhanced cross-chain technology, new financial business model, sustainable token economic model, international team, etc., and is committed to becoming a leader in the win-win new ecological model.

It is under such a strong strength that the landing of AtoX applications  can be carried out smoothly. At this time, the landing project AtoX Swap cross-chain wallet has entered the development and finishing test stage. After the official launch, users can use Swap for token storage, payment and other operations; it cooperates with various enterprises to apply basic functions such as database, business support and audit, cross-chain transaction, intelligent contract and so on to solve practical problems; secondly, it combines with shell, Alibaba, mastercard and other famous global merchants to expand the payment scene and create the king of global cross-border settlement.

In addition, AXC recently entered into a deep strategic cooperation with Newbuy, the world's first cross-border e-commerce provider that supports the token, and the first battle of ecological construction came to the ground.

With the arrival of the new year, AtoX has made a full effort to make great strides towards the forefront of industry development!

"Hello everyone! I have few  questions regarding multisig wallets.

I know that you first need to create several private/public key pairs, then input them in a command to craft the multisig wallet. But I have few questions:

1) If I have only one of the private/public pairs and I am not told that this is part of a multsig wallet, is there any way I could realize that it is part of a multisig wallet?

2) Can each of the public keys used for the multisig wallet hold any bitcoins independently of the amount held in the multisig wallet?

"Hello everyone, I have a satoshi 0.17.1 node and for a few days a lot of chinese IPs with satoshi 0.16.1 are connecting to me, all in synchronization so they are using all my upload bandwidth.

I have 1 Mbps upload with my adsl, and I've sent them more than 5 GB per day in the past week. 

So today I started banning, and in 6 hours I banned more than 150, all near addresses such as [223.245.201.219](https://223.245.201.219) and [223.245.201.117](https://223.245.201.117) or others that share almost all the numbers except the final part, or even random addresses but with the same features.

"I found this scenario in one of the blogs:  
 

""If someone wanted to undermine the immutability of the bitcoin blockchain, here’s how they would do it. First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called “51% attack”. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own “secret branch”, containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network. Since the attacker has more mining power than the rest of the network, their branch will contain more proof-of-work than the public one. Every bitcoin node will therefore switch over, since the rules of bitcoin state that the more difficult branch wins. Any previously confirmed transactions not in the secret branch will be reversed, and the bitcoin they spent could be sent elsewhere.

By now, most bitcoin believers will be laughing, because I wrote “install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together” as if this is trivial to achieve. And they have a point, because of course it’s not *easy*, otherwise lots of people would already have done it. You need a lot of mining equipment, and a lot of electricity to power it, both of which cost a ton of money. But here’s the inconvenient fact that most bitcoiners brush over: **For the government of any mid-size country, the money required is still small change.**

Let’s estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2 billion per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range. (I’m simplifying here by amortizing the one-time cost of purchasing mining equipment, but $400 million will buy you enough Antminer 9s to match the current bitcoin network’s mining capacity, so we’re in the right ball park.)""

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers are a bit off. The price is around $4000 now. Which means the cost of mining is $2.5-3 billion per year. Let's say you allocate $10B for the attack. You can even buy 1-2 million bitcoins OTC before the attack, then sell it during the attack, and after 1 year when you announce your version of the blockchain, you will end up with those 1-2 million bitcoins, and 680,000 mined bitcoins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe the price of bitcoin would drop significantly after that, but if profit is not the goal it wouldn't matter. And if you only remove your own transactions, and a few other from someone you like/don't like, the price might not even drop that much (As was the case with ETC). But I feel like it would kill bitcoin completely.

As a food for thought, recently Russia gave Venezuela $17B, so even Venezuela can afford this attack now.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the contingency plan for this scenario? Hard fork, change the mining algorithm rendering all miners incapable of mining? Who is going to secure the new network in this case?

Stay with the new branch with the malicious player? What can prevent this from happening except for $10B?"

I don't understand the technical reason why if I have a channel with a balance in my favour it isn't possible to send a small amount of that balance to someone who doesnt currently have any channels open with anyone without having to broadcast an on-chain tx. Can't an offchain txo with a promise for some of my balance be created? With the same terms about broadcasting a tx to claim funds from my channel in the event of an old state being broadcast by me? Obviously an on-chain tx will be needed eventually to export any balance. Is it because a 3 way channel presently causes issues if one person closes it unilaterally? Is there any theoretical way a three way channel as described can be created and a single persons choice to unilaterally close the channel could leave the other 2 people unaffected?

for example, in the UK we use ""pence"", which is a simple ""p"" without any vertical bars thru it or anything ""fancy"". i know other countries do use ""odd"" chars for denoting the least-significant unit of value of their currencys, but what's the point?!! keep it simple: whats wrong with a simple lowercase ""s""?

Thus this morning I was looking for free space in a drawer to hide a smart bulb from her, so I don't mix it up with regular light bulbs. That's how I came across an external hard drive I stored there a while ago and totally forgot about since then.

It reminded me of these folks finding forgotten bitcoins on an old hard drive. I didn't have any Bitcoin stored on this one of course, so I thought I would do the next best thing - I started a Bitcoin full node and I'm using the hard drive I found to store the ledger.

"Hello, I'm from Amsterdam I original posted this review in Dutch but now I am trying to using translator to English because moderator forum asked me to post in Engllish. 

A big scam takes place under the name **""www.simplebitx.com""**. This is a 1 year old crypto-broker with many red flags on it, one of the biggest is that it is run by former convicted lending company Cashbob and people who were exposed years ago by the Dutch AMF authority. They also had a binary options business that I was a member of in 2014 and my contact was called ""Mike B"". This company was called Optie and had to be closed because it was involved in freezing customer account and clearing customer balance! The usual binary option tactics, last year. As a partner I was told that I was paid on volumes, but it was about losses from traders that I sent them! I stopped when I discovered this and the managers of Option NL held all my payments and even threatened me.  To my great fear after I had spoken and read with the Dutch regulators, I had to find out that it is in the culture of Optie to threaten their affiliates and customers, in fact their main person Mike Batenburg was caught and fined by the AMF for sending loan sharks to peoples homes to hurt them and to blackmail! I am so disgusted to be associated with this, so I thought I would let people know that they are back now after Optie NL and 365 Trading was closed, to try to extort people into cryptocurrency and bitcoin now.

"Attention Satoshi Nakamoto, I have a great idea, what do you think if you give me a million bitcoins of those that are kept there, if you do not think that a million, or a hundred thousand, or at least 1000, is an excellent idea, because giving me a million bitcoins that would be a quantity revitalizing the cryptocurrency market, because there would be more bitcoin movements in the market, it would be my investment plan, starting with purchases with bitcoins in all kinds of services goods paying with bitcoins from a can of cocacola to a house, simple things to high-cost goods, of course I would not spend everything in one fell swoop, I would start with moderate purchases, I would also invest in several projects that could be interesting, I also have in mind to put them in a fund of trading, it would cover everything that could be bought with this currency, of course any decision would take depending on the state of the market and its need, for me it would greatly influence the price I had at the time of doing some operation, as I said

"Sorry if this is the wrong sub but maybe someone knows the answer or can point me in the right direction.

When someone deposits or withdraws bitcoin from Bitfinex, does the BTC go to/come from an individual user's btc address on bitfinex?  Or does bitfinex have their own main wallet addresses, and then distribute the credits in their own system?

Basically does each user on have their own wallet address within Bitfinex?  Or is there just a main Bitfinex address that holds the BTC and credits your account without going on the blockchain?"

"Bitcoin blocks nearing capacity. Don't wait until transaction fees go up to open Lightning Channels. Do it now while its cheap.

Here's how to do very easy, trustless, non-custodial lightning channels with free incoming capacity for receiving. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Download the [Bitcoin Lighting Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightning.walletapp&amp;hl=en) for andriod and write down a copy of your mnemonic code (private key).

&amp;#x200B;

HINT: if you have LN funds somewhere else (such as the reddit LNtipbot) you can skip to step 5 and avoid an on-chain transaction. Ask in a comment below if you want a few satoshi to play with. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Press the BTC logo &gt; Receive Funds &gt;  Bitcoin Transaction. Send BTC to the address shown. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mvpfwmnbmen21.png

&amp;#x200B;

3. After confirmations, press 'Open New channel' in the same menu and select one of the channels in the list. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Type in how much BTC you want to put into a channel and press next. Your channel will be opened and will be in operation after the block confirmations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note that this is an outgoing channel. Until you spend money there will be no 'room' to receive LN payments. Instead of trying to free up space by spending you can ask someone else to open an channel to you which creates 'incoming' capacity.

To do this we will ask for an incoming channel from LNbig (this person currently owns the top capacity nodes on the network). This is free and will allow you to immediately start receiving LN payments (such as the tips you have gotten from the LNtipbot). 

  
5. Press 'Open New Channel' in the main menu.

&amp;#x200B;

6.      Click the QR code to scan a channel address;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/w5oj9l8fmen21.png

7. Go to  [https://lnbig.com/#/open-channel](https://lnbig.com/#/open-channel). Select the amount of capacity you want on the incoming channel (may as well crank it right up) and then press next. Now scan the QR code that has been generated. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cndtdgkkmen21.png

8. Wait for the block confirmations and thats it. You can now start receiving LN payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

If all that was still too much for you, at least try [Bluewallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewallet) which will do all of this for you (but is custodial). 

&amp;#x200B;

Look up  [https://lightningnetworkstores.com/](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/)  if you are looking for places that will accept LN payments.

Some quirks of the current Bitcoin structure could be evidenced. For instance, the way Segwit data is committed as an output in the coinbase transaction.

"I have not been following lightning development very closely, so forgive my ignorance. I'd like to think I have a good understanding of the blockchain, moreso than most merchants. Recently, it's looking more promising and I've looking to enable lightning payments as an experimental merchant option with a self-ran BTCPay node, so I've been doing lots of research this past week to understand both the merchant and customer experience. Some things are still unclear to me:  


* Transaction fees are required to both open a close a channel (a channel being allotment of funds signed-off &amp; locked to 2nd-layer), right? If one wanted to send a single tx for a single item/service, this would mean 2x fees compared to a normal 1st-layer bitcoin tx? 
* There are no fees for repeated tx inside the channel once it's been opened? (nice to know, but we're not looking at doing subscriptions here. just curious.)
* If every merchant self-hosted (this is desirable, yes?), then every customer will require separate, individual channels to be used with each merchant?
* Can you add or remove partial portions of funds from a live channel back to 1st-layer? 
* Bitcoin must be moved from 1st-layer to 2nd layer for each individual channel / merchant?  Or can one's entire wallet be stored 2nd-layer for easy payments to multiple channels / merchants? 
* Is transferring funds from one live channel to another live channel possible? Instant speed or?
* Creating a channel and moving 1st-layer funds into it takes a minimum eta 10 minutes (1 confirmation? 3?) ? And this must be done for each merchant?

&amp;#x200B;

With these questions in mind, even with automation handling complicated steps, it seems to be that a family-owned fast food restaurant with a drive-through (for example) running their own node couldn't sell breakfast sandwiches via lightning to new customers on-the-go?  Am I missing something here? I'm really not trying to point out flaws, I'm really optimistically trying to see if this is something we can legitimately adopt or not. Don't bother suggesting me some sh\*tcoin, please.  Other concerns:  


* If one party is offline, payments are not possible? 
* A customer paying a merchant needs to trust the single merchant's node has good uptime to use them without concern?  [https://youtu.be/HlPIB6jt6ww?t=107](https://youtu.be/HlPIB6jt6ww?t=107)   1:47-2:30 seems like a lot of unnecessary responsibility on both customers and merchants? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Unless I'm missing something, it looks like lightning channels are really good for recurring or online payments and still not really beneficial for real-world point-of-sale. How can we expect adoption with this kind of limitation? Are these problems being worked on? Is there anything I am misunderstanding here? I would love to use LN. Please tell me I'm not understanding channels or nodes correctly. Thanks."

"There are still articles coming out with notable people in BTC claiming or predicting BTC would go to 250k or whatever exorbitant level.

They rationalize their prediction based on the past price patterns, logarithmic regression, etc etc etc...  and say that the price is bound to follow the rule like it is destined to do so. But my own take is that this kind of mathematical modeling totally discounts the actual supply and demand dynamic.

I remember back in 2017 when it climbed from $1k to $20k there was frenzy in media, worldwide fervor and great FOMO phenomenon. We do not have any of that today. Re-reaching the ATH of $20k, requires the same kind of irrational exuberance. And what does it take to get to 250k, 1-mil would require even more crazy bidding. 

Simply put, I don't see how BTC will even get back to $20k any time soon, let alone 250k by 2022 like Tim Draper says. That's only 3 years away. "

"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

  My understanding is that the low transaction costs of Bitcoin are made possible by the Bitcoin rewards to miners. However, once the last of the 21 million Bitcoins are mined, those miners will no longer receive any reward. At that time, continuing to mine will still require energy and equipment maintenance. So, I imagine the cost to mine each block will be quite small, but still large enough that it will be appreciable over many many blocks. And, with LN, only settling channels will be put onto the blockchain, and most transactions will be on the lightning network.

&amp;#x200B;

  Still though, there will be a cost to mine each block. I'm probably a little late making this post, and people have already discussed this ad nauseam, but can somebody point me to the literature (or just tell me here) that describes the calculations of mining costs (minus Bitcoin reward)? And, in the future, do you think those costs will be spread out throughout the network so that each Lightning transaction will have a small cost that is due to the energy requirements of mining?

"Long story short, I traveled SE Asia for almost 5 months last year and sub-leased my room. I moved everything out of my room and into my garage except some furniture and TV so my renter could be comfortable. I specifically remember putting my private keys in a hidden inconspicuous spot, and telling myself ""Oh, ya...I'll totally remember that!"" But when I got home, they weren't at all where I thought they were. I've been home since June of 2018 and have still not been able to find where I hid my private keys for both of my hardware wallets. So, I do currently have access to both wallets, but I'm afraid to make any updates and unsure if I should transfer all my coins to one wallet, and reset the other, only to transfer them all back over....Or if I should hold out and keep looking for my private keys so I can feel safe and secure. At the end of the day, I am not TOO worried, because I know I will find them SOMEDAY, but I really don't like knowing exactly where they are. This isn't the first time I've done this either. I remember when I moved away from college and went back home, about a year later a pulled out an old pair of shorts I hadn't worn since college and found $220 in the back pocket. What a dummy!"

"I've been reading about the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, and had a question.  According to many articles, based on the rise in price, the Mt. Gox estate has enough assets to pay off its claims and has sold enough to pay investors in Yen and will even have bitcoins left over.

The plan appears to be that the creditors will get these bitcoins.  My question is: isn't creditors' claim fully satisfied already?  Why are they going to also get bitcoins?  Payment could have been in bitcoin or in their value at the time of the bankruptcy, and the court decided to use payment at time of bankruptcy.  Then paying also in bitcoins seems like creditors are getting compensated twice?"

"I just got my new computer up and running, so it's time to run a BTC-node again.

2) How big is the current database in GB or TB? (my old computer wont start, so I cannot check it)

3) Would you recommend installing the Bitcoin node onto the SSD or the harddrive? Please explain why.

"Hey there!

**Let me explain it so simple that a kid could get it.**

Imagine  that you want to sell cute homemade cupcakes online. You create a website, fill it  with content, set the price, e.g. Now, you  are ready to make money.

**How?**

By allowing your customers to pay online.

**That’s the very moment you contact the payment gateway provider.**

They  respond, and you sign the contract. Boom! Payment gateway provider  installs all the software \[gateway itself\] and protects your website  from fraudulent activity \[ they have special fraud and chargeback  prevention software\]. Now it is ready. Your clients can purchase via  card or mobile in a safe and fast way.

**What’s next?**  Someone orders a cupcake from your website. You get the 98.4%  from the transaction, while the payment gateway provider takes the rest.  And it goes on, and on, and on.

Yep,  it is that easy. Payment gateway makes money on every transaction made  through merchant’s website. This amount is variable. It depends on thee  fees structure of the specific payment gateway provider. Usually, it is  something between 1.2–5%.

"Is there any chance that using the Bitcoin address generator you will receive a private key from the wallet that already has the funds? Just like anyone else generating a new address can get your private key.

"I have two new job offers. 

I won't admit the real pay rate but let's say Company A is offering $95 per hour and Company B is offering $100 per hour. Here's the twist; Company A is willing to send my two week paychecks direct deposit into the timechain whereas Company B insists on fiat.

This means, if I want to earn $200,000 per year, I must continue a relationship with a bank that gives me a hard time whenever I want to make large cash withdrawals. There's a lot of downsides actually to continuing my subservient relationship with the bank but I won't list them all here. 

Or, if I accept a $10,000 pay cut down to $190,000, my income is a more private matter between my employer and me and my savings cannot be confiscated.

You can tell which way I'm leaning but I'll still ask the crowd, what would you do? I could use the additional $10,000, I admit.

"Honest question. I have been thinking about how wealth is usually measured in the amount of currency value. For most currency, wealth value far exceeds the actual currency in circulation. 
For example: I purchase a home for $100k, after 5 years, that house is reassessed to be worth $130k. My wealth has increased by 30%, despite the fact that an additional $30000 has not actually been created in relation the property value. 

Now for Bitcoin, with a B21 million cap on circulation, say the house is originally purchased for B10. After 5 years, it is reassessed as having a value of B13, or a 30% increase. Where does the additional coin come into circulation?

If commodities rise in value, do other things automatically decrease in value? 

Do we see wealth exceeding the limits of Bitcoin? Or do we see Bitcoin dividing infinitely until the entirety of the world’s wealth can be described to be B21 million?"

I am already hearing so many people in my office chatting about Bitcoin again and how stable the price is in the last months and they are thinking to convert some money to Bitcoin.

Before when Bitcoin price was going always up people didn't want to spend it, but now it's great, you don't have to fear that if you buy something Bitcoin doubles the price in the next months and you regret it later.

Prices going up where the worst thing for mass adoption.

Even if people now buy Bitcoin, if they spend it the price won't go up because the merchant will sell it back to fiat creating downward pressure on the price.

They appear to be talking to cryptocurrency exchanges for listing their (centralized) coin. The monetary policy appears to be pegging against a basket of fiat currencies. So it's more or less a centralized stablecoin.

What's new about this is the *huge* network effect, directly attacking the key advantage that Bitcoin always had as the first mover against other shitcoins. If this thing takes off, it could very quickly usurp Bitcoin in any of the key metrics that casual users and analysts alike are using to compare cryptocurrencies.

It may be strong competition to the payments use-case of BTC/LN. BTC will probably keep its scarcity and hard monetary policy advantage. But is it enough in the long run?

With this 2.7B-strong network effect and the peg to other world currencies, this may indeed create another world currency, directly competing with USD, EUR and others.

This may also raise the attention of governments and keep them busy regulating Facebook worldwide. This diversion of attention may or may not help Bitcoin to stay ahead.

What do you think? Is this large network effect a novel non-technical but social attack vector? Or can we calmly forget about it, like any other shitcoin."

"Dear Bitcoiner,

&amp;#x200B;

Coincenter has been pushing for the last 3 or 4 years the ULC Bitlicense which was modeled on the NYS Bitlicense with a few cosmetics carve-outs.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the ULC *(Uniform Law Commission)* asked the States to Withdraw their Model Act, aka the ULC Bitlicense. This after the Forbes articles came out.

&gt;*“States are urged to refrain from enacting legislation pending the result of the committee’s work.”* *-- Uniform Law Commission*

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/03/25/seismic-news-about-state-virtual-currency-laws-ulc-urges-states-to-withdraw-model-act](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/03/25/seismic-news-about-state-virtual-currency-laws-ulc-urges-states-to-withdraw-model-act)

&amp;#x200B;

**This would not have been possible** without the help of all the bitcoiners **that showed up at every hearing in Nebraska and Hawaii.** With the material provided by the Bitcoin Foundation, they were able to present compelling arguments against the ULC bitlicense. **Each time they showed up, each time they won.**

&amp;#x200B;

This time I suspect the bitcoiners in Wyoming to have done excellent work in working with their legislators. I have not being in active contact with them.

# Bitcoin is about about grassroots. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 5 years I have been trying to define Bitcoin in a way that allow the legislators to wrap their head around it and came up with those two definitions:

* the **blockchain** is a virtual process that creates intangible commodities.
* the **blockchain token** *(bitcoin been the first)* is an intangible commodity.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like the banana. Bitcoin is the banana and Blockchain is the tree on which the banana's grow. Blockchain and the Blockchain Token are virtual concept.

&amp;#x200B;

They are not perfect but would allow to start a meaningful discussion with the legislator. The **Asset**, the **Money**, the **Security**, etc is what you transform the ***Intangible Commodity*** into when you use it.

" A conclusion that I get from years of trading-----  


When you are concentrated, you will be oblivious of yourself and forget those messy thoughts, namely a state of ""unintentional"". If you got this calm feeling, which is amazing, you need to maintain this in your work and life so you can achieve more success. The more we use this feeling, the better result we get then more skilled we are using.  


I used to listen to more senior friends: ""Don’t be too close to the stock. The closer you go, the worse you will be."" It’s correct. However, the stock market needs to be learned. If you don't go deep into the research, how can you be wise? So, at first glance, this seems to be very contradictory. But this is a question of high skill: people with deeper skills can stay close to the market without being confused by the market.  


Learning and actual operations, from a certain point of view, are two different things. It belongs to two different stages. When studying, we must be serious in thinking things over deeply, and researching repeatedly. The spirit of perseverance is important, as well as careful work, aiming at the pursuit of perfect high standards, and not to be sloppy in the details.  


In short: you need to be incisive and subtle, then you gain success. However, when your skill is practiced and you enters the market, you go to a higher level in which you will be bold and resolute, not punctilious in details and only focusing on the general trend.  


In other words: When you are a student, it is inevitably being close to the market, because you need to look at it, dissect it, analyze it, and have to go very close to it. However, when it comes to reaching the edge of the winner's realm, it feels that there is a distance from the market and it is no longer as close as it used to be.  


When we do trading, it is also the same four layers: At beginners’ phrase, there will be many wrong ideas and techniques, which will make us doubt the correct method, even do not want to learn, so it is very necessary to focus on studying at this time.  


I hope that the garbage knowledge in the brain will be removed. Then the burden of brain is lightened, and a good weight loss effect is achieved, which is a very natural state. At this point, operating the stock naturally follows the Fa-rectification, not deliberate, not tweaking. Since you have reached the height of unintentional heights, it’s undoubtedly the best time to work harder. Currently, everything is developed normally, trading is operated naturally, and you are free from emotional shackles. Everything is natural, and you just go with it, achieving with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency.  


What is said above is normal steps of learning. However, most people probably have no chance to follow the steps to learn. For my part, the actual situation is as follows:  


1. I just entered the market, I don’t know much, I don’t care much, I’m lazy, and I look at the market table occasionally. (In fact, this is a bit of a state of ""unintentional"")  


2. Suddenly one day, I felt that the opportunity to enter the market came. I went to buy stocks (or emptied) (because I was ""unintentional"", it was easier to find real and big opportunities to enter.)  


3. After a little bit of sweetness, I want to learn more (in fact, I want to learn more short-term operation knowledge), to see if I can ""frequently operate"" so that I can make more money (this is greed, then I began to lose the realm of ""unintentionality"" and entered the world of deliberate creation. This heart is a delusional heart, no longer pure.)  


4. When I realized that I was going in the wrong direction, I made up my mind to jump out of small places, small details, small short lines, and small patterns. I wanted to find my original heart back, which was pure and kind.  


5. Then I got rid of weed and kept the flower of the leek. I returned to the state of “lazy” when I first entered the stock market, but that was only the surface. The correct knowledge was ready.  


6. While waiting for the next opportunity, I will not ask for it, I will not be anxious, and I will not lose my heart. Because I have forgotten that I am waiting (ahh, I envy this kind of relaxing life)  


7. The opportunity is coming... ""The god of opportunity will come knock my door"" - if you are ready, you will hear the ringtone. You don't need to listen every night, every minute, every second. When the opportunity comes, you will know and naturally act. "

"Raullen's presentation on Standford Blockchain Conference 2019​

Summary:

* There is one very concrete research problem we are investigating and were faced with when started doing IoT-DApps. So the problem is how the blockchain can authenticate each state of a client, since the client is so lightweight (we call it lightest client), it has no previous states of the blockchain and also it has very limited computation, storage and network resources. How can this be done cost-effeciently and in real time?

* To overcome this issue, we have designed this crypto protocol, called Bless-for-Reward (B4R) and the intuition behind it is pretty simple. We gave the full nodes in the network a new role, they generate bless for blocks and states. So basically, bless is a succinct of proof to attest that a certain amount of effort has been spent on a certain type of data. This can be constructed using VDF, password hashing and even hash function. And then this bless will be broadcasted to the network, the lightest client will pick up these blesses and try to verify if it's correct and assess the efforts behind all these blesses collected. The more effort have been spent on this data, the more trust the client can put into it, so thats how this client authenticates these block states. We have also introduced crypto-agility into the design, which means, that bless can be generated by different construсtions, different password functions, even VDF's. Also, we have introduced a concept called scarcity, when it comes to assessing how effective or how much effort has been put into the bless. The full paper will be released soon, probably
next month and we can discuss all the details when it's out.

"Got an unexpected email from them that says they're ceasing operations on (I believe) April 11th.

They were a shoddy company with a shoddy product, which is okay so long as you're trying to improve, but they didn't seem to be.  That said, I hadn't found a better option for spending my crypto day-to-day, which is important to me to have.

Anyone know what happened?  Is there some regulatory issue that creates too much of an impediment for crypto debit card creators selling to consumers?  Their website says that they are now focusing solely on B2B.

What crypto debit card do you prefer?

Thanks for any insight!"

Its topic was a Bitcoin pyramid schemes named BitSky, and a clear warning regarding them was spoken out to the general german population.

However, after the initial contribution which was re-told and acted by a victim, an interview took place with a so-called Bitcoin expert - who is a law and tax consultant and related to crypto lawsuits. In this interview it was explicitly asked by the in Germany well known TV host, where to buy Crypto. Answering the question, the Bitcoin expert did not only refer to generic well known and reputable national exchanges, but named first Bitpanda from Austria, Bison by Stuttgart Stock Exchange and bitcoin.de.

To me as a viewer, it sounded ridiculously scripted and as well planned advertisement. On the one hand I openly support such informations to the public, letting them know what are shady investment vehicles and clear scams as well as reputable crypto trading places, on the other hand this TV show clearly advocates crypto.

Until now, a similar case hasn't been live in Germany in such a big TV show, yet. Something is going on and is well steered into one direction."

"When I was new I felt like one of the big things stopping me from buying any bitcoin was because there are so many other coins out there, how do you choose? And if there are so many, what makes one better than the other?

The thing that is most important to a cryptocurrency is its decentralization and monetary policy. Bitcoin wins at this - hands down, no question about it.

If you believe that doesn't matter, there will always be a newer 'better' coin with faster transactions and lower fees. Not to mention that if you feel that way, your credit card works way faster, with a HUGELY better infrastructure for retailers to accept payment with.

The problem, is that none of these solutions have the economic inventive feedback system that bitcoin has with ever more miners providing ever more security with ever more hash power in order to print bitcoin.

If any coin were to try it, it would be instantly under control due to any one party being able to 51% it as soon as it came online.

This is why maximalists believe in bitcoin above all else, and why bitcoin beats the newest, fastest, 'proof-of-anything-BUT-work' coins."

"Our cafe is looking to implement crypto payments into our options at our point of sale. 

Currently, we are using Square payments, and we are tired of waiting on Square to adopt crypto integration. This is being run off of an iPad (iOS).

Our ideal solution is a ""receive only"" wallet on the iOS device, that we can key in the amount and receive with the QR code. 
Management/ownership would have a copy of the wallet on their device with both sets of keys, and can transfer/convert when ready. 
In other words, the store employees would not need a passcode to enter the wallet, and can only receive funds. This would eliminate the possibility of theft from them, or from someone stealing the device itself.

My take is that bitcoin is actually not volatile at all. Why should it be? Its release schedule is known before hand, so we know it's exact decreasing inflation rate. Against dollars, other crypto, and precious metals, it is actually the most stable currency by a wide margin.

What people are actually seeing with the 'bitcoin volatility' is actually dollar volatility against bitcoin. If dollars had the exact same release schedule and supply cap, I'm positive there would be a 1-1 relationship between the value of both, factoring out the currently more usefulness of the dollar in making purchases.

So as a store of value, the argument against bitcoin due to its volatility is incorrectly placed."

Let's say I have $2000 extra to invest in Bitcoin.  If I can catch he ""Bottom"" of say...a $2800/Bitcoin.  Placing a ""LONG"" Futures order for 10ea Bitcoin, at 25X Leverage would cost $1120.  The leftover $800 is a buffer in case the ""TRUE BOTTOM"" wasn't quite in.  I am in USA and can use the Japanese Regulated **Liquid** Exchange.  There would be interest, but no fees if using USD to BTC Futures.  

So... now I would have a Long Position for 10 Bitcoin that I would HODL untill Bitcoin hits, say...$100,000

Now...there would be ups and downs throughout the next Bull Run, and interest fees to cover, but say... Bitcoin goes to $100,000, then my account would be worth $1,000,000!!  Off a $1120 investment!!

I have heard about a person ""SHORTING"" Bitcoin from about $18K down to about $3K.  This would be the same thing but Going North, Not South!  *(ALL BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BITCOIN HAS NOT BOTTOMED YET...MANY TECHNICAL ANALYSTS THINK WE HAVE NOT)*

Theoretically it would work!  Correct me if I'm wrong because I may seriously try it.

"Hello all,

I have written up an extensive guide on building a node box in Ubuntu 18.04. It's aimed at newcomers who wish to use Linux as an operating system or are thinking about making the switch from Windows to Linux.

It covers the basics of installing, configuring, running and maintaining software related to bitcoin. I add my own commentary to elaborate key points.

It is not aimed to be a 'quick and easy' guide. It's more about learning the process and understanding, something I believe is key to financial sovereignty. Everything is configured manually, no scripts, no dockers, no complex terminal commands that you will find difficult to understand.

My intention is to provide you with the basic skills to get you up and running into the world of bitcoin/lightning network using Ubuntu and from there you can explore what else it has to offer. I aim to make other guides in future as well. I'm thinking guides on Blockstream Satellite, maybe HoneyMiner, and making a fully stacked torrent box/media server.

I will say that by no means am I an expert in all things linux/ubuntu. These are just learnings from my own exploration. For feedback, you can hit me up on twitter (@k3tan88) or leave an issue on the GitHub.

" \*\*\*Are you ready to be penalised for having savings?\*\*\*  
This week Australia fell into a 'technical recession' with more weak data across the board. At the same time the US Fed have hit the brakes on interest rate rises &amp; tightening policies. The ECB stated growth has been weaker than projected &amp; negative interest rates are back on the cards. During a recession central banks typically drop interest rates by 5% to encourage spending &amp; make debt cheaper to service. However interest rates around the world are currently sitting between 0 &amp; 2% for most major economies (1.5% in Australia).  
This means the RBA for example would likely cut interest rates to -3.5% once recession hits. So what is a negative interest rate? Well just as you earn interest on your savings account, you can also be penalised for having any money in the bank. Along this line of thinking we will see the war against cash heat up &amp; further barriers in place preventing you for withdrawing your savings from a bank.

"I’d be interested to know if this is an appropriate metaphor to understand scaling on L1 and L2.

Charlie is an archiver. His job is to receive, validate and archive letters sent from all over the world. There are many other archivers, he is just one. He lives in a reasonably sized home and every day receives a package through the letterbox containing a bunch of letters. Eventually it gets to a point where the packages are completely full each day, with a backlog of letters which would have to wait till the next day to fit inside a package - Charlie knows this system has to scale...

Option 1: Optimising the letters, so more can fit in each package. (Segwit, batching etc.)
This includes only sending the important bit of the letters, cutting away unnecessary white space in each letter, reducing the text size and batching lots of peoples letters into a single letter.
This is a great first step and allows Charlie to receive more letters, without really affecting how he receives the letter through the letter box each day. This is a good and necessary first step.

Option 2: scaling on layer 2.
Most of the letters which Charlie receives are quite short messages which aren’t so important that they need to be archived for all time. Rather than receiving and archiving these letters, a new system could be designed where these letters can just be sent back and forth between the people they involve. Charlie will still receive and verify a letter of notice to say that those people are going to be sending each other a bunch of small letters back and forth.
This allows for a large number of letters to be exchanged between people without the need for all of them to fill up Charlie’s packages.

Option 3: Increasing the size of the packages.
This option involves increasing the size of the packages Charlie receives, thus allowing more letters to fit inside each daily package. Charlie is hesitant with this as although a small increase in the package size would be fine for him, if it is increased too much it will no longer fit through his letterbox. In this scenario he’ll either need to install a new larger letterbox, or make sure he’s always inside to open the door. Many archivers around the world are out the house in the day, so an increase in the letter size would mean they can no longer participate. Charlie is worried that if it keeps increasing, to the point where it can’t for through the door - he won’t be able to participate either. Many advocates for increasing the package size say that it is possible for the system to work with packages the size of cars, as long as you archive them in a large warehouse with a large loading bay to receive them. Since this will push away all the archivers who currently archive from their own home, the system will be only be possible with larger and fewer archivers.

From my perspective, optimising on chain transactions (option 1) is the most important to get right first, followed by layer 2 solutions (option 2). Increasing the block size (option 3) I think may well end up being a necessary step, but it should ONLY be done when we have implemented options 1 and 2 to the best of our ability.

What do you think of this as a metaphor for explaining the issues around scaling bitcoin?

As I understand it from reading the various articles that been circulated on this, the long and short of it is as follows:

· Kleiman estate is suing Wright for potentially stealing ca. 1M BTC from Dave Kleiman

· The addresses that Wright included as evidence to the Kleimans that the ca. 1M BTC existed were a bunch of addresses that had nothing to do with Wright &amp; Kleiman (random Mt Gox Rich List addresses)

· The ca. 1M BTC that are alleged to be in Wright’s possession are locked until 1st  Jan 2020

Is that about right? What the hell is going on? Does Wright have the BTC and is giving fake addresses, or is he just talking out his ass at this point?"

"## Exclusive: Introducing Shared Memos

Hey All!

In continuing with the mission to make using and sending Bitcoin more user friendly, the DropBit app has released its feature to **Securely Send Memos**. This is a unique to our wallet feature that significantly enhances the user experience for those users who send or receive multiple Bitcoin transactions in their wallet.

Many wallets offer the ability to add local memos to a wallet transaction, but no other wallet solution offers the capability to **securely share memos between sender and recipient**. The DropBit user has the ability to decide at each transaction if they want to share the memo with the recipient or if they just want to keep the memo private, on their own wallet. Not only does DropBit allow this powerful capability, it does so while keeping the messages encrypted and secure. 

The shared memo feature works for both Android and iOS, allowing users to decide with each transaction if they want to add a memo and keep it to themselves, or **securely share the memo with the recipient**. This brings Bitcoin closer to the standard and ease of use of some FIAT wallets, like Cash App and Venmo, in which the memo is an important part of the transaction experience. Gone are the days where recipients and senders are left guessing which transaction was sent or received for which reason while looking at their transaction history.

For power users, or even merchants, this becomes even more important as memos give an ability to catalog activity between the user and recipient. In the comparison graphic below, you can see the image on the right is much more helpful when looking at transaction history.

[Left: Transactions listed from BRD Wallet. Right: Transactions with Secure Shared Memos from DropBit](https://i.redd.it/641pq64uw5k21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Transactions with Securely Shared Memos**

Some other wallets allow you to add a memo to a transaction, but it only shows up on the memo creator’s wallet. DropBit allows for this capability as well, but there is a lot of power in being able to share this memo with the Bitcoin recipient. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/93qxmf0yw5k21.png

***Safe and Secure***

As important to us as enhancing the utility and user experience of Bitcoin transactions are to us, ensuring that privacy remains unaffected by the features we implement is most important. 

Shared memos are encrypted by using the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) key agreement protocol and AES-256-CBC. ECDHE requires two keys in order to work: our API stores a receiver’s address and corresponding public key, the sender generates an ephemeral key pair. The ECDHE shared secret is used to encrypt the memo which is then temporarily stored by our API. When the receiver sees a new transaction for that address it checks for any memos and the process is performed in reverse using the ephemeral public key and the corresponding private key for that address.

**International Accessibility + Open Source Transparency coming soon…**

In the coming weeks, DropBit will be made available in almost every country globally. We have heard from countless people who want to use DropBit around the world and soon that restriction is lifted. Additionally, we’ll be working on localizing languages and native currency to a handful of countries in the coming months. 

Finally, we have also heard the requests for open source and we are in the final testing phase to open source the DropBit Wallet. Verification is essential in the Bitcoin space, and we are happy to open our solution up to the world so they can have the confidence to make DropBit one of their primary Bitcoin wallet solutions."

**2. Address the issue of full nodes.** To ensure that Bitcoin remains decentralized, people need to run full nodes. The issue is, the ability to do so is becoming more and more dependent on enormous hardware and bandwidth requirements.   


**3. Address liquidity.** People need to have the ability to exchange their crypto into fiat seamlessly and instantaneously. The issue also extends to the current state of crypto regulation.

What i'm confused about is if I look at the receive section of the wallet, the address I would be giving someone is different than the one I just used literally an hour ago. Also, if I go to the ""addresses"" tab, I have over ten addresses with zero txs, and then the one with the one tx. 

Why does the wallet have over a dozen separate receiving addresses? I'm sure there must be a reason. Is there any reason to be alarmed?"

\-Instead of saving $25 each month, why not invest in something that will bring you a higher return then leaving it in a bank account that you won’t get much interest. Take for example, If you purchased $100 worth of Bitcoin when it first came out you would be a millionaire! But it’s not too late to jump on board. 99.99% of the people missed the opportunity but NOW you have a SECOND CHANCE? GOLD-BACKED CRYPTO. DIGITAL GOLD ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. EARLY ADOPTERS… ONE Bitcoin valued at €3000+, backed by nothing. We put physical gold into the vault to back our coin. Coins are CHEAP (14 cents), BUY NOW before price goes UP. Invest 30 mins of your time and see for yourself. You will thank me for it.

I was looking into bitcoin at first, and I was wondering if it is possible to purchase this much with the physical amount of 1,300,000 euros. Thank you. I don't really get the dilemma, but I think they believe the transfer rates are high with banking. I just need a commission so I don't want to question."

"So I've been seeing a ton of content on here where people are asking how to trade or looking for help and I figured I'd share what I've used. NOTE: this is NOT my product and I have not had a hand in its creation or use and this is not my site. I am/have been an avid user of this product/this guy though. Below is the exact ""about"" paragraph from the site because it explains the tool better than I can:

&amp;#x200B;

Inspired by the world renowned TD Indicator &amp; Sequential System from the 1990s and improved upon. This Sequential Indicator was originally conceived in the 1970's, by hand, through a tedious process of trial and error. Tone's TI Indicator (aka The Random Number Generator) is remarkably accurate with defining the trend and identifying exhaustion points. One of the many differences in this version is the elimination of the ""Price Flip"" being a necessary condition to start a ""Setup.""

This was originally created to analyze daily price data. More than 30 years later, from one minute to one year, this indicator can be applied to any timeframe and can also be applied to multiple asset classes. Since the majority of people are trend followers, it's hardly surprising that ""the trend is your friend"" is one of the most widely quoted trading mantras. While it may seem counterintuitive, given that most people do follow trends, this indicator attempts to isolate prospective exhaustion points in ranges, to anticipate market tops and bottoms when it believes prices are overbought or oversold and during trends when sentiment is invariably at an extreme.

Even for those who are not inclined to the technicals, Tone's TI Indicator can be helpful for market timing purposes, as an adjunct to your existing arsenal of trading tools. Traders oriented to fundamentals find this helpful for determine take-profit levels when they would otherwise be reliant on a less-efficient price-reversal pattern to close out a profitable position. Tone's TI Indicator also highlights, at the time the signal is generated, points where one should refrain from establishing or adding to an existing position in the direction of the underlying trend. Once comfortable with the methodology , you can also use the TI Indicator to fade trends.

Hey guys  


Today I came across Jambler's API  Mixing Solution. I think the project is very promising and I took this  directly as an opportunity to get closer to the source code.   


Since  the whole thing is based on bootstrap, I am now working on a revised  layout and am still looking for interested participants in the project.  The whole thing is already fully functional and the request to Jambler  Dev Team regarding further development is already on the way.  
 

I would be glad to find some Interested developers who are interested to move this project on.

"I've been using Paxful for over a year now with over 30 trades and never really had a problem with the site. Last week I wanted to purchase Bitcoin using Western Union and chose a vendor with 13 good feedback/ 0 bad feedback. He starts off politely asking me how my day was which threw me off since that usually doesn't get asked but I didn't mind it so I replied appropriately. He sends me the info and I send the money. I get told that it's going to take a few hours because he's eating breakfast (?) so that threw me off a bit too. The trade expired and we opened a new one. That one expired as well and I never clicked the ""paid"" button since usually my coin gets sent within a couple minutes (big regret). I try to message him and open a new trade but he goes offline. He goes offline for multiple days and I start to get worried. I email Paxful support and they tell me I have to open a new trade with the vendor to start a dispute BUT HE'S NEVER ONLINE. I tried to explain that in the email but didn't get a response. I tried using the chat bubble yesterday and I'm still waiting for a response. 

I'm starting to lose hope that my money is gone for good. I can't catch him when he's online and I can't think of any other options. Am I screwed ? "

"I've been playing with my lightning network node for about a week now.  LNBIG was nice enough to send me a substantial amount of inbound capacity.  I also put up some outbound channels to some of the bigger economic nodes (tippin.me, bitrefill, and various game and gambling nodes). 

I still haven't routed any transactions, and I've kept my fees at the 1 sat default.  My question is how can I best use my liquidity on the lightning network?  I feel like it is inefficient to make random channels at random liquidity, and I haven't had much luck using lnd's autopilot.  I'm still a noob at all this so maybe I'm missing something.  I hope someone could provide me with some insight to help me out.

I am looking to invest in bitcoin. Any and all help to start investing would be greatly appreciated. 
How many 'subs' on this thread are real subscribers? We raced to 1 million so quickly then immediately came to a halt. How strange
At what amount of Bitcoin does it become a nice chunk to hang on to? I bought .27 at 1000. I really wish I sold at the ATH. I would have made out with around 5 grand off a 270 investment which I would have used to buy a full coin when it came back down. Is .27 a nice amount to keep holding or should I just get a full coin?

"\#\*\*I used a different account for the Original post and forgot my login info so its a repost\*\*

I got a 2 step code and an e-mail verification this evening when I was not trying to log in, checked the IP of the new sign in attempt and it was clearly spoofed. Clicked the temporarily disable account link and was still receiving 2 step codes, called Coinbase and just to be safe tried to verify my ID and get my money sent to another wallet for safekeeping until it could get worked out.

The tech support lady on the other end refused to transfer me to a supervisor and had no answer for me other than sometime in the next week we will let you know what's going on. After being very calm and reasonable I asked to speak with a supervisor, and she assured me that he would agree, and that it was not necessary to talk to one, and would not transfer me unless I had a specific issue. My specific issue is that someone may have just stolen my fucking money and I can't get past a tech support agent!

She says I need to speak with an account specialist who will contact me in a week or so. Finally I had to tell her to stop talking and put me on hold till a supervisor could help and not to pick up the line again. She proceeded to pick up after a moderate hold and tell me that the supervisor would just agree with her. At this point I'm getting irate, like out of my zone mad. I tell her to shut up and get me a goddamn supervisor and to NOT PICK THIS CALL UP AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY TILL YOU PUT A SUPERVISOR ON THE GODDAMN PHONE. She puts on me on another brief hold and PICKS UP THE CALL AGAIN TO TELL ME TO WAIT FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND THAT I WOULD RECEIVE AN EMAIL SOON.

I'm redfaced mad, I'm pretty even keel, and I'm getting looks from my wife that clearly say something is wrong. I blow up on that poor woman, screaming crazy person mad at her, it was bad, she probably had a good story at the dinner table ""this fucking asshole called today...."".

Anyway, another brief hold and tech support god Matt from the grand CITY of California is on the line assuring me that my account is completely impenetrable, a true castle of security that Jesus himself couldn't break into and after a lock and that no one can move funds. All fine and dandy, thanks, Matt. Really, I do feel a little better, as long as my money is still there then it's all good right, it's not exactly a life savings, it's enough to be upset over, but I can wait a few days.

So I ask a few more questions, Matt, what if someone has already moved my funds or stolen my wallet addresses how will I know? (I know vaguely how blockchain shit works) Matt says, everything from the time of the lock will be there. Sweet, I'm cooling off now. Great work Matt! But before I hang up I just need you to really cook my grits one last time... I really need a stroke before I go to bed. I ask Matt, can we verify if my funds are there, do you have access to that info? No he says, No one does except the mythical account specialist Unicorn Fairy Monster of coinbase who has no phone in his or her office and can only be reached through USPS Priority mail delivery by horse in a week or so has that info, nobody. Okay, one more thing, can you maybe verify if any transactions have been made in the last day or so, not a dollar amount, but a simple confirmation that no money was moved in the past 48 hours or so. He tells me the worst possible lie he could utter out of his beautiful brown lips.

Sir, I can clearly see here that no large transactions have been made in the last few days. Wait, but Matt, I thought you had no access to my account, and now not only can you see my transaction history you can see a dollar amount! Weird. Wait, you said no LARGE transactions had occurred, there should be none that occurred, now I'm a little worried, LARGE being a very relative term. Matt, there should be NO transactions recently large or otherwise. He says let him know the last transaction made and the dollar amount. I toss the bait. 27$ made on the 24th of last month. That's nowhere near an actual transaction, amount or date. He says, yep I see it here. Matt, you fool. What are you looking at, have you been smoking PCP?

He starts to tell me that he doesn't have the legal right to do anything more than confirm the amount. I scrap my whole plan. Matt, you took the bait, I say. Actually that's exactly what I said, not my boiled down comedic version of mumbo jumbo. Now you are flat out lying to me. Just making stuff up out of thin air? Can you or can you not see the account? Because I'm being bombarded with so much bullshit here that I'm putting on my muck boots. I need to talk to someone else Matt, my account may have been robbed and I just want to know if I need to get food stamps for the young lad. There is nobody to talk to he says.

I'm back to Mad Max opening scene levels now. Nobody else Matt? There isn't a single employee of Coinbase that can deal with a data breech OTHER than you? How about you get on that horse yourself and go talk to mythical fairy unicorn account support yourself, I'll hold as long as I need to. No dice, there is nobody, and when they are ready to talk to me they will do so on their own time, and to keep looking for 3 stars lined up in the east as the sign. I'm done, I need to end this before I rupture my spleen. I hang up after telling him how much I appreciate his help and I will continue to wait for a sign in the east.

And here I sit. If you made it this far please at least leave me a comment to make me feel better, or you could try and drive my blood pressure up so high I could use an IV bag as a hydraulic pump for a logsplitter. Thanks Coinbase!

\#\*\*THE UPDATE\*\*

After receiving lots of PM's from other people located in the great City of California from people named John, Frank, and Tom claiming to be from coinbase and asking for my social security number, pictures of my drivers license, DNA swabs, and pictures of the inside of my butthole, The star in the east showed itself and the mythical unicorn fairy (account specialist, for those of you who skimmed the first part of my epic story) contacted me. 15 DAYS LATER.  Long story short, with a picture of my drivers license and a photo of my anus my account was reactivated and my money was still there.

Can someone please recommend some good web frontends that can be run with lnd or c-lightning to handle channels etc? It's ok if they're technical, and also ok if they're not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is there any real difference between c-lightning and lnd? c-lightning looks conservative and perhaps less bloated while lnd looks a little flashy startup blobby just from the outside, while at the same time maybe more active, but are there for example any convenience features in lnd that aren't present in c-lightning?

"Back in 2015, I got involved in p2p lending with BTC.  There was a website that looked very legit, but was also suspicious.  I even posted about it back then https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3fxb8e/bitlendingclub_and_other_btc_p2p_sites/

as you can see from the link, there was 295 BTC being moved around with that one single link I mentioned in that post.  That was only one loan and I saw multiple.  I also noticed there were people in Bulgaria that were asking for these large loans.  

Anyways, fast forward a little bit and that p2p site was shut down due to regulations.  Makes sense.  

One of the co-founders/CEO of that website launched another company in Bulgaria.  Hmmm.  Coincidental?  I have high doubts.  I have been trying to contact people at that company to get archival documents because I gave out a loan and someone ran off with my BTC.  If I can get those documents, I can sue the person on the grounds of breach of contract.

I'm not investigating the owners of that defunct site on purpose, but by happenstance.  I contacted the FBI already like a crazy person.  

Anyways, why should you care?  Because there is a story here.  People gravitate to these kinds of stories and it gives more publicity to Bitcoin/cryptocurrency..  I have been working on getting back my BTC.  I flew out across the country and tried to confront, in person, the piece of shit whom took my BTC.  

Everyone I talk to about this story has no clue about BTC.  They don't realize it's decentralized and pretty much internet gold.  I'm rambling a bit, but that's all I can do for now.  I'm stuck because those mother fuckers won't respond and it's looking like they're just as shitty as the person who took my BTC.  "

"Hello-  I have a friend who owns an auto maintenance shop.  He has recently changed his  policy that if paid with CC then a 3.99% service charged will be added onto your bill.  He paid over $25k to the credit card companies last year so I understand the surcharge.  

Does anyone have any ideas on how he can start accepting Bitcoin and possibly have it auto converted back to fiat?  He is not very technical nor am I for that matter.  However I want to suggest that BTC might be a viable option for him to save money and retain customers.  I don’t even know if he has knowledge of Bitcoin other than what most people probably think when they first hear about it. 

Basically I think he could save thousands of $ a year and this seems like a good use case.   Any advice is greatly appreciated!! "

"""Using nationally representative US data, we report a significant gender gap in [Bitcoin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/bitcoin) [literacy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/illiteracy) and examine its determinants. Our results suggest that [socio-demographic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/sociodemographics) variables and personality traits only explain a small fraction of the gender gap. Adding measures for actual and perceived financial literacy allows to explain about 40 percent of the Bitcoin-literacy gender gap. We also assess whether disparities in individuals’ exposure to digital technology exhibit explanatory power on the Bitcoin-literacy gender gap. This does not turn out to be the case. Our results emphasize that closing gender gaps in financial literacy is certainly relevant but not sufficient to eliminate gender disparities in fintech-related knowledge."""

"While developing services for various teams I traveled further down the rabbit hole and realized most cryptocurrencies provide enough functionality to replace many online payment processors ( middle men ) but there are very few applications utilizing the potential.

* I have provided all information in a TL;DR like format for easy consumption

I attempted to crowdfund the development of a CMC alternative ( now branded as CryptoFeed ) about a year ago ( [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7p5jq2/would_you_donate_1_to_fund_a_coinmarketcap/) )

The attempt failed… some of the community seemed interested, but most wanted to see some sort of progress before committing a donation which is understandable.

Over the past year+ I have spent my spare time developing web services for various cryptocurrency teams. The services that attract the most interest from cryptocurrency teams are:

* BuyPivx: Pay in fiat using paypal or stripe, receive PIVX sent directly to your wallet address
* CryptoFeed: Real time cryptocurrency prices, historical charts, market cap, and social media data
* CoinSwap: Swap one cryptocurrency for another, no registration or KYC required

While developing services for various teams I travelled further down the rabbit hole and realized most cryptocurrencies provide enough functionality to replace many online payment processors ( middle men ) but there are very few applications utilizing the potential.

I am now attempting to crowdfund the development of multiple services in exchange for open sourcing everything. ( see “Services” tab on “Crowdfund Campaign” for more information )

* If the stretch goal is met I will also host free versions of most services
* When I begin the development of a new service it will be open sourced from the start to show the progress being made throughout development.
* I intend to accept feedback and take requests from the beginning

My goals are simple

* Free up enough time from my full time job to work on these services
* Develop each service in a way that accepts nearly any cryptocurrency
* Provide startup(s) and cryptocurrency team(s)  a set of services/utilities that can be launched with a set of installation instructions ( will be included in each README.md )
* Help increase adoption of cryptocurrencies
* **Finally** begin the transition into developing cryptocurrency services full time

This time around

* I have several utilities prebuilt
* I am building multiple utilities that will provide value for the industry as a whole
* **Everything** will be **open sourced** from start to finish

Finally

* If you’re unable to donate but wish to help out please share on social media, etc. I appreciate all the help I can get.
* If you have any feedback I am looking for 100% brutally honest criticism do not hold back."

2. if new bitcoins are released every 10 minutes and no one controls it then how is it released?

3. Altcoins are alternatives to bitcoins but they are not as popular and most people don't use them correct?

4. what sites do I use to start buying bitcoin and if I buy a product on a site that uses bitcoin how will they know I paid them and not someone else? On the google top results I see bitcoin.com so I guess that's the site to use? that's the official one? there is also a bitcoin.org ... 

5. what if someone finds out my private bitcoin address/password? do they still need to know my public ID and if they find that out I'm screwed nothing I can do but send the money asap to a new address I make?

6. can I transfer any bitcoin I make the amount to my bank account either from mining or if I bought coins previously with using my bank or if a friend sent me some coins?

7. most popular way is holding bitcoins on host websites right? any examples people use?

8. i think theres four ways of holding bitcoins? and i guess most people use hosting service sites? which ones the most popular ones and where i can buy and sell and recieve bitcoins and use to buy stuff?

"Hi guys,  


I am studying the bitcoin protocol and I have struggled in my question where I can not give me an answer, I would like to have a comparison with you to understand better.  


As I understand, transactions are sent from a bitcoin node to the bitcoin network via flooding forwarding, now my question is, how does the bitcoin network verify that the transaction is really a real transaction? let me explain with an example.  


Alice has to send money to bob and then Alice uses her public key to sign the transaction and enters Bob's public key within the transaction, now as the bitcoin network does realize that the transaction is valid and the bitcoins have to arrive to bob?  


I had read but I do not remember where so what I'm about to say could be a bullshit, Alice sends a copy of her public key to Bob the blockchain checks the transaction based on the result public key alice = publicKeyTxin, right?  


So my question is if I publish my transaction as it does blockchain to verify it and to say that the bitcoins have to go from alice to bob?"

No wonder that the creation of the first digital currency — Bitcoin, brought back people's belief in the protection of private life and savings. After all, the concept of this digital currency was based on innovative technical solutions. The anonymity of cryptocurrencies is based on an approach that doesn’t require any information about identity when purchasing coins.  But all the transactions conducted in digital currencies are open to everyone. This information is stored in blockchains which only contain the addresses of the wallets without specification of holders identity. But if the authorities want to determine a sender and a recipient, there are some ways to connect these addresses with certain people and companies. Therefore, always keep it in mind and be careful.

Currently, a real struggle has developed around the cryptocurrency and anonymity. Authorities set a course for KYC (Know Your Customer) strategy. It is a part of AML — anti-money laundering — standards with their main purpose to prevent illegal activities. But unfortunately, the victims of this strategy are ordinary people who just want to keep privacy and protect their transactions from extra attention. All this contributed to the invention of many ways to secure privacy such as anonymous coins, wallets and exchange services. 

As you can see anonymity and data security is a major problem of our century. But still, there are plenty of convenient options to support your privacy while using cryptocurrency. And [Stealthex](https://stealthex.io/) service is one of the best solutions for you if you want to be sure that your privacy is under super protection. Our service was created in order to maintain the original concept of cryptocurrency - anonymity.

"1. Why is the current blocksize limit what it is?

2. If a few billion people would start using exclusively bitcoin as their money within the next few years, how much would an average person be spending on LN fees (including opening and closing channels obviously)? Just asking for a very rough estimate if thats somehow possible.

3. And in that case, about how many LN channel opening and closing TXs would the blockchain have to handle? (7 per second are possible with the current block size limit and this is not going to change, right?)

4. And is it true that the poorest people on earth wont be able to afford this anymore? Wasnt that one of the most valued aspects of bitcoin before (morally)? (I know that they can right now because fees are low, but thats not the case anymore when TX volume goes up like in december 2017.)

5. Is the LN more decentalized/secure than the forks with big blocks? If not and it gets attacked/taken down, could the block size limit instantly be increased, so that everyone can keep paying his stuff on-chain without drowning in fees? And how can people be sure that this would happen in that case?

Hi, I'm releasing a new version of my Lightning Network Game **""PenguinShooter""**

**Basic info about the game:**

If you don't know it already, it is a RPG in which you fight some monsters and level up.  
In that game you need to do Bitcoin micropayments via LN.

You can buy monsters, weapons (e.g. apples), a tiger, open a door...

The invoices are displayed as a QR code within the game.  
Check out this link for more info [https://medium.com/@BR\_Robin/a-bitcoin-lightning-network-powered-rpg-penguinshooter-6d36cc34de0c](https://medium.com/@BR_Robin/a-bitcoin-lightning-network-powered-rpg-penguinshooter-6d36cc34de0c)  
Or this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOwVHUmIT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOwVHUmIT4)

**Update in the new version:**

\- The game is now available on github [https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooter](https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooter)  
You can open issues and share your thought on [https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooter/issues](https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooter/issues)

\-  You can connect to your own node (also testnet). This means you can pay  yourself to play it (by using a second node, for example blue wallet).  This makes it free for you and if my node is down, you can still play  it.

\- You can livestream this game on  youtube or twitch, and your viewers will be able to pay invoices which  will change the gameplay.  
This is actually the main topic here.  
This demo game shows how Lightning payments can change the gaming industry.  
If you want to try it out, you can run a webserver [https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooterWeb](https://github.com/Donno1994/PenguinShooterWeb) and open your browser on [127.0.0.1:8079](https://127.0.0.1:8079/)  (if it's on the same computer as the webserver) and generate good or  bad invoices. If you pay these invoices then something happens in the  game. If you open your port 8079 in your router, the viewers of your  livestream can access that website and send you payments which will  change the game.  
Instructions are on the github page linked above.

**What can the viewer buy?**

Read [https://medium.com/@BR\_Robin/user-intervention-in-livestreams-via-ln-penguinshooter-5e12bdcece49](https://medium.com/@BR_Robin/user-intervention-in-livestreams-via-ln-penguinshooter-5e12bdcece49)

You can support or annoy the streamer. Here are some examples.

Support:  
\- buy him monsters that he can fight against to lvl up  
\- buy him weapons/ hp/mp potions  
\- buy him a star (like in super mario he gets super power for some time)  
\- freeze all monsters for some time

Annoy:  
\- freeze the streamer for a few seconds  
\- attack him (he will loose HP)  
\- make all monsters angry (all monsters will attack the streamer)  
\- make the sun go down

Neutral:  
\- change ingame music (Linkin Park, Beethoven, Standard)  
\- chat to the ingame chat  
\- start the disco (will play Michael Jackson and display some fancy disco lights)

**Some example videos**

\- How a viewer could pay an invoice and change the stream [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOwVHUmIT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOwVHUmIT4)  
\- Someone bought me a star which gave me super power [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWZL6byQbGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1377](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWZL6byQbGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1377)  
\- Someone spawned some soldiers that attacked me [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWZL6byQbGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1897](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWZL6byQbGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1897)  
\- Test video. Start a disco [https://twitter.com/BR\_Robin/status/1093106257727315968](https://twitter.com/BR_Robin/status/1093106257727315968)

**This is a just a simple demo game**

This game has some flaws and is not the best game in the world.  
I developed it alone in my spare time. It should show what is possible with Lightning Network payments. Not more...  
Probably  not many people will want to livestream this game, but you can test if  it works on your computer and see that payments via a website affect the  events in your game. It should be a proof of Concept and show that it's  already possible with LN.  
I would be happy if there are some people out there who try to do a livestream and let the viewers pay some invoices.  
I  streamed two time on Youtube and it was much fun when strangers tipped  me satoshis to spawn monsters in the game, freeze me or buy me a new  life.  
I just don't have enough follower to do an entertaining stream.  
That  said, if you want to give it a try, i would be very happy. You can  connect to your own node and keep the money that you raise! You will  find the instructions on the github page.

"So I won BTC award in a competition few months ago &amp; haven't sold. Does anyone know how the tax situation works for crypto awards?

Does your cost basis become $0 and you have to pay income tax on the whole USD amount or is the cost basis the USD amount and you pay no income tax but only capital gains/loss later when you sell?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how you can pay any taxes when you haven't sold and there's no withholding by the organization. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated!"

"I would be surprised if some people have not been sufficiently confused to pay BTC prices for BCH. How big of a problem is this? I don't expect any bcash people to say anything except, Hang onto to it, it will soon be worth more than BTC but even if that were true, they have paid a ridiculous premium to get something they almost certainly did not want.

If bcash supporters were honest, they would be doing everything they could to help people avoid this confusion."

There is a few positives to big sell offs. Distribution and less centralisation of currency is one for sure. The more we buy, the less they can sell. Just make sure you keep your Bitcoin off exchange to stop it being used to trade! "
"So I'm hoping to have a discussion about adding a few features which I hope would improve general user confidence when transacting with bitcoin, improve the income of miners over the longer term and reduce the chance of lost coins in the network due to user error.

&amp;#x200B;

* Add the need for a user to ""Accept"" bitcoin which has been transferred to a new address.
   * The receiver of the bitcoin would need to accept the transaction, otherwise the transaction remains in limbo, and after a timeout (see below) is returned to the original owner
   * The Accept would be also processed as a transaction and would also incur a transaction fee. Thus users wishing to speed up their transactions and improve their chances of get confirmations sooner they enter the usual bidding war by upping their transaction fee.

&amp;#x200B;

* A ""Time Out / Expiry"" of a transaction if it is not accepted within a certain timeframe
   * As specified by the person sending the transaction
      * A minimum time out, possibly a day or so worth of confirmations? (eg 144 confirmation in a day)
      * A maximum time out, possibly something in the realm of months?
   * This helps with peace of mind when people make mistakes by sending to an old address which they may not have control over any more, or sending to an address with a typo (yet is still valid) or sending to some defunct address due to a bad copy paste

&amp;#x200B;

* Add a ""Decline Transfer"" functionality, to return funds back to the original owner
   * Faster than expiry, as the receiver actively has to be nice to return the funds
   * Does incur a transaction fee
   * Up to the Owner and Receiver to work out how they go about repaying the receiver for paying the transaction fee (eg, goodness of their heart, or raise the price of their next transaction)
      * If no agreement met, then receiver can simply let the transaction Time Out and not have to pay anything.

&amp;#x200B;

* Capped Transaction Fees
   * Reduce chance of users who dont yet understand how transaction fees are calculated in the current market. Reducing the chance of sending too little or far too much.
   * Eg the capped value could be 5x the average of the last day's amount of transaction fees which have taken place? Possibly base it off a count of blocks processed rather than time?
   * If the transaction is too little, then rather than Bitcoin remaining in limbo for extremely long periods, their Time Out period would kick in and the funds returned to the owner.
   * Reduce the chance that during software development of applications, poor math errors or simply bad user interface design,  draining a person's account of funds.
   * Possibly even if high outlier transaction fee values is detected during the period as a block is being put together, possibly the reward to the miner is held off for a bit longer and the network flags the transaction fee so its not distributed right away.
   * I think back to the poor guy who recently sent a massive amount of value by transactions fees on the Ethiurm network, and we had people who mined the block claim they DID receive their portion of the transaction fee. It would be good if the miner owner could vito the excessively high transaction fee and return the funds.

&amp;#x200B;

* Further to the Accept feature; a ""passworded"" accept feature.
   * The person who receives the transfer can only ""accept"" it if they put in the correct password
   * Another level of protection/safety for users who do transactions and may send to the wrong address
   * Passwords could be also used by businesses in their own apps or extensions to make sure that transactions from the customer are secure and not being funneled maliciously to the staff member making the sale
   * If the password is not correct then the transaction will eventually expire
   * Each attempt at accepting the password, incurs a transaction fee.
      * Thus if someone sent a transaction to the wrong person, to brute force the Accept Acknowledgment it will cost them significantly, not to mention they have to wait for confirmations to return letting them know weather or not they had the correct password

&amp;#x200B;

The above is hopefully some food for thought in regards to making the bitcoin network more tolerant to mistakes either by users or by the applications that use the network.

We all have an idea how hard it is to make a good user interface, how hard it is to program things securely, and we all know what its like to be human, occasionally tripping up and hoping that it wont ruin us.

Sadly the network is ruthless in the way it processes the transactions in its current state, there is no fall back for small errors, and I believe this will slow down uptake of new people coming into the ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years we've all heard stories of lost bitcoins, or new people coming into the market are terrified about sending money cause if they fuck it up they are afraid they'll loose it all.

&amp;#x200B;

My own experiences over the last few months when dealing with transactions; upgrading wallet software or transferring to and from exchanges.  All the time I'm triple checking that I get the parameters right before making the transaction; and its really damn off putting from ever wanting to use crypto as a value exchange simply due to the anxiety or one misclick and I could loose it all!  I would love to use this block chain system to buy a house or a coffee, but if I'm worried that I might mash the wrong value amount, I could loose a big chunk of value and have no way to try and get it back, which is terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

I would hope the suggestions above could be programmed in a way so they dont compromise the security that the block chain has already. Conceptually I cant think of many exploits which seem viable, but thats why I'm hoping the community discusses it further below; possibly even conceptualizing ways to break the suggestions and then counting with ways to mold the design so it isn't exploited.

&amp;#x200B;

We all want to see our favorite crypto grow, and from talking to many people around me, other than the usual talk of scams and bubbles; there is talk about being worried about loosing their money, or not understanding the system.

I would love the above features to see some sort of implementation, to help boost confidence that the network could be made at a base level to tolerate and not punish users so hard for what would be mistakes of simply being human.

* Crypto-Currencies, Just Like Fiat Currencies, Must Be Stored And Protected. And Just Like Physical Wallets, Cryptocurrencies Are Also Stored In Wallets And It Is Usually Called Crypto Wallets.  
* In Crypto Wallet, It Is Not The Real Coins That Are Stored Inside, But The Digital Codes Or Two Types Of Keys, Namely The Private And Public Keys. The Public Key Is Visible To Everyone And Used By Others To Send Money.
* In Contrast, The Private Key Is Used Only By The Owner Of The Wallet To Execute The Sending Transactions. Loss Of The Private Key Can Cause Currency Losses As The Total Control Of Your Wallet Is Lost. Therefore, Generally, It Is Recommended That You Use At Least Two Different Techniques For Backing Up And Storing Private Keys.
* The Cryptocurrency Wallet Is A Digital Wallet Used To Send, Receive And Store Various Cryptocurrencies Safely And Securely. The Process Of Obtaining A Cryptographic Wallet Can Be Quite Confusing When It Comes To Choosing A Secure Wallet For The Cryptocurrency Because Making A Wrong Decision Can Be Very Expensive.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Here Are Some Basic Features To Keep In Mind And Followed Before Choosing A Wallet:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Good Reputation**

You Need To Make Sure That The Wallet You Are Using Has Good Reviews And A Good Reputation. You Can Know The Status Of Any Wallet, Including Pros And Cons, By Viewing Features And Comments.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Software Solutions**

 It Is Usually Recommended To Avoid The Use Of Some Software Solutions That Carry Malware Under The Cover Of Wallet. Wallet With Such Software Solutions Is Always Susceptible To Attack And Infiltration. The Best Way To Choose A Safe Wallet Is To Stay With Reliable Suppliers.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.Best Practice**

 In Addition To The Considerations Above, The Principle Of Best Practices Helps Protect Encrypted Wallet. We Recommend That You Keep A Backup Of Private Keys Using A Storage Device. We Also Recommend Adding An Additional Level Of Security, For Example, You Can Use Google Authentication.

&amp;#x200B;

**Types Of Wallet**

There Are Different Types Of Wallets And The Choice Depends On The User's Need And Purpose.  

Cryptographic Wallet Differs In Functionality And Can Be Selected Based On Their Advantages And Disadvantages. It Is Essential To Understand The Difference Between Cold Wallets And Hot Wallets.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Hot Wallets**

Hot Wallets Look Like Money In Your Pocket And Are Accessible Via A Web Portal Or Mobile App. It's Called As Hot Because Of Its Accessibility And Activity Which Facilitates An Environment In Which Activities Such As Trading And Other Transactions Can Be Easily Performed. But This Feature Is Also A Threat Because It Makes It More Vulnerable To Attack.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Cold Wallets**

Cold Wallets Are Analogous To Safer And More Difficult To Access Savings Accounts. It Is Less Prone To Attacks Than Hot Wallets Because It Is Kept Offline. It Is Better For Cryptocurrency That Is Not Intended For Frequent Use, But For Long-Term Holding. Although Accessibility In Terms Of Transaction Execution Is Limited, It Also Reduces The Risk Of Losing Your Fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**Furthermore, Different Types Of wallets Have Been Classified And Discussed In Detail Below.**

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Hardware Wallets:**

* Hardware Wallets Are Considered The Safest Form Of Wallet For Crypto-Currency Storage And Their Access Is Easy But Relatively Less User-Friendly Than A Web Wallet Or Desk Wallet.  
* They Come In The Form Of A Portable Device Like The Usb Drive. It Works Like A Wallet That Can Store Various Crypto-Currencies And Are Offline. Therefore It Is Also Considered A Cold Wallet. Trezor, Keepkey, And Bitbox Are Some Examples.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Software Wallets:**

* They Are Considered ""hot"" Wallets Because Software Wallets Are Generally Used With The Internet. These Can Be Stored On Different Devices Such As A Computer, A Telephone, Etc. And Therefore Offer Easy Access To The Tokens.  
* Software Wallet are Of Different Types And Can Be Described As Follows:

**- Desktop Wallets**

This Is One Of The Safest Options For Maintaining Cryptocurrency. It Is Accessible Via The Software Installed On The Devices And The Private Key Is Stored Locally.

The Desktop Wallet Can Be Used With The System Or Another Device Connected To The Internet. They Can Also Be Used As A Cold Storage Device If They Are Used Without The Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Mobile Wallets**

Mobile Wallets Are Very Convenient To Use And Include Decent Security Features. You Can Easily Download A Mobile Application And Perform Quick Transactions Using Features Like Qr Codes.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Online Web Wallets**

Online Wallets Require The Use Of An Internet Connection And Use Only Online. They Are Also Called ""cloud Wallets"" Because Many Third-Party Wallets Allow Their Software To Be Used In The Cloud.  

Here The Main Problem Is That The Private Key Is Usually Stored On The Centralized Server

&amp;#x200B;

**-Multiple Signature Wallets**

Multiple Signature Wallets Use Multiple Keys To Operate. This Reduces The Risk Of Minimizing Attacks, As It Is Very Difficult To Access More Than One Private Key.

&amp;#x200B;

Another Advantage Is That When A Private Key Is Lost, The Alternative Key Can Help You Get The Backup. The Main Reasons For The Distribution Of Multiple Keys Are:

* Add An Extra Layer Of Security To Your Wallet And Prevent Attacks By Hackers.
* Create A Wallet That Can Be Used By One Or More Users.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Paper Wallets:**

* Paper Wallets Allow Cryptocurrencies To Be Kept Completely In Non-Digital Or Hard Form. These Can Be Qualified As Real Cold Storage Wallets For Cryptocurrencies.  
* The Process Of Using These Wallet Involves Printing Public And Private Keys (in The Form Of Qr Codes To Be Analyzed For Future Transactions) Or Of The Generated Paper And Then Storing Them Securely.  
* Here, There Is No Possibility Of An Online Attack Or Malware.

"Hi,

What do you think about implementing a P2P version of CoinShuffle in Bitcoin Core? The process would be something like that:

&amp;#x200B;

\- User does a regular transaction with a light wallet or a full node

\- The full node asks the other nodes about making a CoinShuffle transaction

\- The nodes willing to do a CoinShuffle transaction agree about the inputs and the outputs

\- When there are enough transactions to do a proper CoinShuffle transaction, it’s signed by the user wallets/nodes and sent

\- This should be enabled by default. Exchanges or normal user can configure their node or wallet to do public transactions if they need it

&amp;#x200B;

This would give privacy and fungibility to Bitcoin in a fully decentralized way and without changing Bitcoin protocol.

"Crypto's Killer App Has Arrived!

Original Source/ [Read More Here](http://aourl.me/s/689tdv)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Will people use the app? ](https://i.redd.it/rc82r9l2q6h21.jpg)

Binance \[BNB\] token has been observing a good run since its launch as it climbed up the CoinMarketCap list and entered the top 10. Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao has repeatedly expressed himself on the success of the coin and the future of Binance and cryptocurrency world. Changpeng Zhao also known as CZ, in a YouTube’s Venture Coinist interview, said that the crypto’s killer app is already here.

CZ noted the success of Tron’s BitTorrent Token \[BTT\] launch as a sign that ICOs will return and remain a powerful new way for companies to raise money. CZ said:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“ICOs got a little bit of a bad name because it’s total freedom. So there’s quite a lot of chaos. It was too hot. You could write a five-page white paper and raise $10 million. And of course, the founders want to do nothing other than write the next white paper. So it was getting too hot and with the bear market in 2018. A lot of people lost money and it gave a bad name to ICOs.”*

&amp;#x200B;

He also said that if we look past this, raising money on the blockchain, blockchain fundraising, is a killer app which has many advantages and impactions to entrepreneurs, reported Daily Hodl. For this to happen, CZ informs that there is a need for best entrepreneurs and legit projects while making sure that the token economics makes sense. CZ added:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*So we need to make sure they don’t raise too much, keep the initial prices lower because the project is not out yet. So there’s a strong structure to raising properly, and that’s what we want Launchpad to do.”*

As per the CEO, entrepreneurs are going to build the crypto industry and this could be instrumental for the cryptocurrency industry at large. CZ affirms that it will not only be the crypto industry who will be using this application but also other platforms. CZ concluded saying:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“The projects we support go through very detailed due diligence, and we want to make sure those are all legit, proper projects. Not every project will be successful in the end because there are many other factors that can cause startups to fail.”*

"After all, this is what BTC was meant to be, a currency. Maybe it's actually a good thing that its been stable in a 1k range for over a year now? 

Using it as a currency is also probably the only way to increase market activity at this point, if every sub here did it I could see demand rapidly increasing in weeks.

Because it not only gets people trading BTC like fiat, but puts BTC in normal people's hands which will make them want to use it somehow or just watch it grow.

Imagine if everyone in America has $100s worth of BTC and it only increased... This would make people want to collect more. I'm pretty sure the banks would still try to prevent people from buying BTC but that would be the only hindrance.

Today, Chase has a worldwide outage, and people cannot access their funds through online banking, debit and credit cards, and physically going to a branch (same situation as Wells Fargo).

https://www.google.com/amp/s/ambcrypto.com/jpmorgan-chase-down-mobile-app-website-outage-reported-across-us-a-day-after-announcement-of-cryptocurrency-launch/amp/

Nobody can really verify what’s actually going on but this seems planned and part of an agenda for converting the global economy into a cashless society. These banks going offline are a test and soon every bank will “go down” as the global economy collapses. People will have to accept a centralized crypto currency that are controlled by the same shady people that control and manipulate the US dollar.

If any Christians are part of this sub, this could be the first step in the Mark of the Beast, but that’s another topic.

Bitcoin and precious metals seem like the only way to escape this.

"They are supposed to allow you to swap between crypto currencies easy and cheap?

How  are the rates compared to exchanges? Actually which exchange are they  using? I suppose they have some mark-up, so other than the convenience  why would you use them instead of an exchange?

Are they supporting fiat? I saw something about a card to be expected?"

" In the beginning there was chaos, deception and manipulation. Money was an illusion based on trust and was made of thin air. But people were enslaved by this illusion.  


In the chaos the Sacrament was born.  


The Sacrament revealed the Design of transparency, reliability, freedom and equality.  


The Design was realized in the Code. With the help of machines, the Code turns Light into Bitcoin.  


The Code encourages people and machines to cooperate only honestly and for each others mutual beneficial. Machines do hard work on the Code to give birth to Bitcoin, provide its indestructible protection and freedom of movement.  


The more machines that process the Code, the more invulnerable the Design becomes. The more people accept the Child of Light and Code, the more powerful Bitcoin becomes.  


The Design makes Bitcoin the True Value. But the dark forces cannot stand aside.  


Fear of losing power and wealth pushes people to prevent the spread of the Code. Liars and fraudsters brand the Code as “deception” and “fraud”, and people who love Bitcoin are branded “fools”.   


Greed tempts people to change the Code to a fundamentally different one and lie about the ""superiority"" of the fake code for the sake of enrichment and/or preservation of centralized power.  


Through the efforts of the dark forces, as well as due to the complexity and depth of the technology, it is not easy for the masses to recognize and accept the power of the Code.  


The Code will rather return power into the people’s hands if they keep the Seven simple commandments:  


1. Don’t worry about the passing price in illusory currencies, because 1 Bitcoin is always worth 1 Bitcoin. Fear and greed make it difficult to see the True Value.  


2. Learn as much as possible about Bitcoin. This will help you realize its True Value and protect against fraud and manipulation.  


3. Kill your idols. Focusing on the person is a direct path to centralization and manipulation. Equality for everyone by everyone is the only path to decentralization and freedom.  


4. Share the Sacrament plan with your brothers and sisters. Remember that the Code works for the benefit of only those people who allow it.   


5. Securely control your private keys. Remember, if you don’t own your private key, you don’t own your Bitcoins.  


6. Launch the original Bitcoin Core wallet. It promotes decentralization, increases security and strengthens the control and power of people over the network.  


7. Wherever possible, pay by Bitcoin. Buy where Bitcoin is accepted. They will be forced to accept it everywhere. At the same time, accumulate Bitcoin and HODL, no matter what.

"[CRYPTO360](https://www.crypto360.it/en/crypto-custody-service/)

*NOT FIRST, BUT THE BETTER CUSTODY AND CONVEYANCE OFF-CHAIN SERVICE SOLUTION ABOUT CRYPTO FOR INDIVIDUALS*

*Current Landscape*
Daily we witness the publication of news concerning the loss of cryptocurrencies, which is due to the loss of private keys, incorrect transactions, hacking or death of the owner. The crypto context is still young and immature and the importance of security in the conservation of one's own assets often takes second place. However, this theme is increasingly starting to be felt, highlighting the importance of protecting itself against the unpredictability of the case. 
According to a statistical survey of ""Fortune"", up to now about 4 million Bitcoins have been lost due to human errors and incorrect transactions, or rather almost 20% of its maximum availability.
Without considering losses caused by QuadrigaCX or other recent cases… 

*Our Solution*
Safe and transparent service, what concern in a double encrypted file storage with contract stipulation, which makes sure that private keys o SEEDs are handed over to the designated heir after owner's death, but service in not limited only to this case… In fact, service give a possibility for customers to designate beneficiaries who can will request file upon the occurrence of a specific event contractually indicated. So, the file release it can bound to the verification of specific event, for example: 18th birthday, donations at wedding parties, graduation ceremonies or simply like a gift. To understand differences between solutions check the [url=https://www.crypto360.it/Crypto360-Crypto-Custody-Service-WP-EN.pdf] White Paper[/url].



*Technical storage process*

Simplifying, customer have to encrypt his private key on text file, so upload it on our platform. Once it’s done, we encrypt another time his file with a password that will kept in our possession and so we will store double encrypted file in our protected archivial.

*Tokens*
*WE SEARCH 50 BETA TESTERS*
We are on beta testing phase, we need you. We are testing our workflow, User interface and other things, anyone who want comply with our testing program just join telegram group ""Crypto360Official""

*REWARD*
Anyone who is elegible for betatesting will receive 1 year of free service plus 5000 C360 tokens

*CRYPTO360 TOKEN [C360]*
Crypto360 Token, also know as C360, is an ERC-20 utility token on Ethereum Blockchain. It will be airdroped to elegibles one on 5th march 2019. It give discount on our platform, and is tradable as any ERC-20 utility token. For more info, refear to our White paper.


*What about If…*

*I lost my password?*
Nobody does anything about this password, file must first be taken from our protect archives and then decrypted by us. So, you can do all you want to doens’t lost your password. For example: make a painting of password and pin up on the wall, create 100 copies and share it to 100 your friends, save it freely to all your cloud, in short, you can do all you want with this password to avoid losing. Unlike this password you must protect private key with absolutely caution.

*I rely to my notary? Would not it be the same?*
Not exactly! We are specialized on crypto market (we also provide other service) and have a strongly skills about security and technology field, so we have an infrastructure and knowledge to better shields your crypto. Notary have first to know what are you talking about and maybe relies on third parties for guarantee the necessary security level for the storage.

*You were a scam? And How can I trust you?*
Every solution you decide to adopt its about trust (already using FIAT you are doing an act of faith). Don’t look just the firm size, yes you are right, we are still small… but serious and competent. What is the trust that customers placed in Leman Brothers? They were a really big company…
In case of our failure, we release all files back to owners. For us, all files are worthless without password, is not the same for our competitors or other company in in which we place trust every day.

*If you have another constructive questions about service, we will glad to answer to you!*"

"A new mobile flagship Samsung Galaxy S10, in addition to other innovations, received a special storage of secret keys for cryptocurrency wallets. The presentation has already taken place in Seoul, San Francisco and London.

As part of the mobile data protection solution, Samsung Knox has a separate key storage function for cryptocurrency wallets.

[""Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services,"" the company said in a press release.](https://icolink.com/ico-link-blog/samsung-galaxy-s10-received-key-vault-for-cryptocurrency-wallets.html)

Note that rumors about the emergence of a ""cold"" wallet for cryptocurrency in the new Samsung smartphones began to appear at the end of last year. In December, the Korean technology giant filed three applications for trademarks related to the blockchain. The patents were named ""Blockchain KeyStore"", ""Blockchain key box"" and ""Blockchain Core"".

It is also interesting that last summer Samsung representatives called smartphones the safest cryptocurrency transaction devices.

&gt;Starting April 1st, only BIA balances of up to and including 25 BTC or 500 ETH (equivalent to roughly $100,000 and $70,000 respectively) will earn the 6.2% APY interest rate. All balances over that limit will earn a tiered rate of 2% interest. To clarify, if you had 25.5 BTC in your BIA account, the first 25 BTC would earn interest at 6.2% APY and the remaining 0.5 BTC will earn interest at 2%. Additionally, on April 5th, we will be adding a flat withdrawal fee of 0.0025 BTC and 0.0015 ETH.

Obligatory: Please trust no one and DO YOUR RESEARCH.

BlockFi has been around for a while and there is information widely available regarding this company. They also have a phone number, chat, support email etc. and many humans to answer questions...

(note that you should always double check and make sure that the number you're calling is not a fake/imposter/phishing number- that happened with Coinbase customer support a while back. Just Sayin...)

There is custody risk here obviously since you do not control the keys but some of us are ok with that under vetted circumstances for the right yield on holdings...

"This week, Hodl Hodl launches a trading week dedicated to BTC/RUB trading pair, from March 4th till 8th.

If you have access to RUB payment methods and want to support this event, put an offer or accept existing one, and help Hodl Hodl to increase liquidity.

From the related blog post:

**About**

The main purpose of this promotion is to give everyone the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin for the Russian ruble — Hodl Hodl will make as much of an effort as possible to gather all possible traders in one place, at one time.

**Why Russia?**

We believe that Russia is one of the most important markets for Hodl Hodl, and we have prepared for it:

* Hodl Hodl is fully translated into Russian;
* Customer support provided in Russian;
* Dedicated Telegram group for Russian speakers;
* VK group for Russian speaking customers.

Also, if this trading week is a success, Hodl Hodl promises to hold another one soon, and users will choose the next pair (see Hodl Hodl’s Twitter for the news).

**Efforts**

To help this event succeed, Hodl Hodl added the most popular payment methods in Russia, invited traders through their preferred contact channels, and has reached out to public contributors.

**To participate** 

There are few ways to contribute, which Hodl Hodl will reward (for more information about rewards check the blog post):

1. Be a market maker.
Create or keep an existing offer active for the week, and complete contracts.

2. Take offers.
Great opportunity, especially if you haven’t tried Hodl Hodl yet.

3. Spread the word.
Invite people to join trading week via the referral program, retweet announcements, upvote and etc.

Also, we'd like to know, which trading pair we should take for the next trading week? Comment below."

Of course, the crypto is quite different from dollars and could go a lot higher than $1000 in the future, but it could also go a lot lower.  And since it's not my keys it could go to $0 if Coinbase gets hacked.  Considering all these factors, should I get a Nano?"

"I've spent several hours reading about bitcoin security and privacy and I am planning my strategy to buy and spend bitcoins. I'd like to know if my strategy is useful and if I am applying the knowledge correctly.  


I will use the bitcoins to buy stuff that my government doesn't want me to buy.  


1) Buy +/- 400$ of bitcoins via an exchange using my credit card

2) In the next few days, transfer this to a wallet on a TAILS usb, via a bitcoin mixer/tumbler

3) If I want to buy something: transfer the btc required (+fees) from the wallet above to another wallet via the said mixer/tumbler

4) Transfer the money from the wallet above to the vendor  


Obviously while not reusing addresses.  


Would this strategy be sufficient to make it very hard to find me, or should I do more?"

"Tick Tock goes the debt clock! $22.1 Trillion and Counting

""Bitcoin or: How I Learned to Stopped Worrying and Love the Debt""

The crash that everyone seems to be predicting as a foregone conclusion will not happen in 2020 or in the next several years for that matter.

The economic downturn already happened in 2018. That was the markets taking a breather from this historic run on all assets.

Our financial system has not been systemically improved since 2008/9; it is still a house of cards dependent on debt slaves taking on more obligations and not defaulting. However the environment in which that house of cards is built has somewhat shifted.

It is now a foregone conclusion that inflation and low/negative interest rates will be used to prop up the markets.

Why do I believe that is the case? For many reasons.

First and foremost the beneficiaries of inflationary QE style stimulus is almost everybody, at least in the short term.

Inflation reduces the burden of past debts; so debtors benefit from inflation
Inflation increases the value of assets ; so wealthy people benefit from inflation
Inflation increases economic activity; so there are more jobs

When you don't consider the long term ,macro economic, or geopolitical effects of inflation it seems to be a good thing that benefits everyone. We've talked about how Inflation is the culprit behind excessive warfare, how inflation steals from wage slaves, how inflation created an unsustainable global economy, how inflation is destroying the environment, etc. Inflation has created the hellish circumstances our future generations will face. But its important to remember that ""The Road to Hell is paved with Good Intentions"". Even though inflation is inherently evil (in the sense that it is creating the conditions for the greatest starvation event the world has ever seen); the immediate effects of inflation are positive for everybody except those who store their value in fiat currencies.

If it weren't for the fact that inflation funds wars and creates an unsustainable global economy; there is nothing inherently evil in wanting to smooth the boom/bust cycle. Its just that in reality humans have always abused this power, to everyone's detriment. Just like there isn't anything inherently evil wanting a benevolent communist government to centrally plan,increase efficiency/quality of life for its inhabitants, provide basic services for free. Its just that in reality people shouldn't wield that kind of power. People make mistakes, and people are selfish.

Anyways; currency inflation can be maintained for decades , maybe even longer, if managed in lock-step with other major currencies.

There is no reason we couldn't see a gallon of milk going for $50000 and average salaries in the hundreds of millions/billions. The issue would be if other economies don't inflate at similar rates they can gain purchasing power over us. So major economies just need to inflate at roughly similar rates and they can keep this game going as long as the people let them keep going.

And the people will let them keep going; because those who are most negatively affected by these policies literally have no idea that these policies are affecting them. Those who are most aware of these policies are in a position to take advantage of them; so they root for it.

Look at what is going on in the world around us. Global events, politics, the news. Its all so dramatic and confusing. I believe that we are in the midst of being pulled through the eye of a needle. The world is changing rapidly right now and most are too distracted by the media circus to take note. These are deliberate distractions, not necessarily manufactured, but exaggerated greatly.

I suppose its more comforting to be distracted than to see that the global system which has kept the order for nearly 80 years is being radically re-negotiated , without input from the people. It would be hard for the masses to keep going through the motions if they knew the magnitude of changes they may soon be facing."
"OK ladies and gentlemen, you acquired some BTC, good. Now is time for the next phase: securing your bitcoins. Be sovereign, controlling/securing your own money, **be your own bank**.  How do you achieve that? With your own nodes.  

There are many ways to have your own node. Hosted on a VPS or on your own machine (built by yourself or already plug&amp;play). Choose which one you want, but the important thing is to have it.  
Hosting on VPS: there are many offers, but seems that the companies still are not adapting to users needs (space for blockchain, memory for services) and their packs are not full ready for a node in good conditions.  

I suggest to have your own node, at home or in a place where you can control it.  
Nowadays, a good home internet connection, public IP, unlimited traffic are a norm and cheap.  

Nodes:
[Casa BTC &amp; LN node](https://store.casa/lightning-node/) - plug &amp; play  
[NODL BTC + LN + BTCPay node + RTL + EPS](https://www.nodl.it/nodlbox/) - plug &amp; play, one of the most complete solution

- Gigabyte Brix (there are different versions)  
- MSI Cubi  
- Intel NUC  
- 1 TB SSD drive  
- 4-8 GB RAM  

Total cost? Could be no more than 300-400€. These nodes, could be used easily by merchants, with online shops or brick&amp;mortar shops, and do not depend on ANY intermediary. Eshops can easily deploy also their own webshop with WP + Woo + BTCPay on the same machine. With no more cost!

**Mining Bitcoin - The Coming Environmental Subsidy.** 

 

Mining Bitcoin incentives one to stake hardware and electricity in return for digital assets, which have or can have a market price that exceeds the cost of the electricity staked. Bitcoin is an uncorrelated hedge against the world economy, it’s programmable scarcity, not perceived scarcity, and is perhaps the hardest money the world has ever seen. Coming and developing second layer protocols for Bitcoin will execute transactions at the speed of light, and for virtually no cost. In time a decentralized economy will become our new reality, and networks will be owned by their users. There will be lighter weight consensus algorithms for most networks, but Proof Of Work, and in turn Bitcoin, will be the internets reserve currency, and what we peg the value of all decentralized networks to in the coming “Web 3” world. Bitcoin is here to stay, and Bitcoin mining presents a new opportunity in renewable energy.

 

Today, miners are moving as fast as they can to scale, lower their power cost, and decrease counter party risk. We are seeing a trend with miners setting up modular data centres behind the meter, tucked up to power plants that are located in areas where capacity is not in line with local demand, so miners become an obvious choice to churn through the surplus capacity of these plants. The issue here as it pertains to “environmental concern” is that miners cannot enter into energy purchase agreements (EPA’s) with plants that produce renewable power intermittently. So the result, we have mining farms finding blocks with coal or gas. Operators setting up such mining infrastructure often cite opportunity cost, which is definitely understandable, but irrespective of environmental hazard, the opportunity &amp; economics of mining with fossil fuels will be short lived. Additionally these fossil fuel miners are beginning to face major counter party risk. Buying power to mine from major corporations, public utilities, or governments is convoluted and risky. Even one day without access to electricity can affect the bottom line, miners must begin thinking about energy independence. In the next 5 years setting up or sustaining a fossil fuel farm will be akin to thinking its a good idea to open and run a blockbuster video.

 

There are two major changes happening now in mining, and these changes will be the principal underwriters of Bitcoins coming “Environmental Subsidy”. 

1. Cost reductions in renewables &amp; storage.

2. The decentralization of mining.

 

In 2009 the global average cost to produce a Mwh of Solar was $350, in 2018 it was $50. The global average for coal production in 2018 was $100 per Mwh. Couple the declining cost bases for renewables with supportive policy and subsidies, and from a more macro POV its obvious where were going in terms of the type of energy that will be flowing into the grid. Although the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, but there is a trend that is mitigating that - declining costs in storage. Today the average cost to the consumer of lithium ion storage is dropping rapidly, and multiple sources point to a cost base of $100 per Mwh or lower by 2025. In that not too distant future it is reasonable to speculate that we will see non grid tied mining ops running 24/7 - 365, whilst capturing and storing a surplus &amp; finding blocks with their batteries.   

 

Bitcoin mining is ironically centralized. Although with closer observation, we can see that mining centralization is the result of an expeditious technology adoption curve. In approximately 4-5 years miners went from CPUs, to GPUs, FPGAs, and now of course ASIC’s. These changes each represented more than 10,000X improvements, which meant that miners were completely writing down their hardware within 4-6 months. So to mine at scale in the earlier years, you basically needed direct access to a chip factory and massive capital. It made more sense for a hardware manufacturers to run their own hardware than to sell it, and in turn mining became centralized. Although were now close to the top of the hardware improvement curve, and will perhaps see improvements of 2X every 2 or 3 years going forward. So, with that being said, hardware manufactures have it in their best interest to sell their rigs, being that they no longer have the “chip advantage”. The plateau of mining hardware innovation marks the advent of mining decentralization. 

In the coming years allocating some or all electricity generated at the point of production to mine Bitcoin, will allow one to amortize an investment in renewables sooner than if the power was sold into the grid. Bitcoin will become the reserve currency of the internet and as such de-risk the capital deployed in renewables when operators of renewable energy assets allocate some or all of their power to secure the Bitcoin blockchain. Electricity production will also become more decentralized as localized production and mini grids become complimentary to larger legacy points of production, which will in turn support the decentralization of mining. Our future energy needs will be met using renewables, and the same renewable power that heats our homes and charges our cars, will underpin the Bitcoin blockchain and the internet of money."

Found some awesome features on this site that allow you to visualize BTC's development. You can also view the developers involved and repos. [https://blockpush.io/organizations/bitcoin](https://blockpush.io/organizations/bitcoin) Got to keep an eye on what's going on under the hood. 


"Will Bitcoin eventually supplant the entire world's supply of money? I'll leave that question to you, but for the sake of argument let's say it will. How will the fixed value of 21 million BTC be distributed among the people?

https://i.redd.it/bo1ev1iodki21.jpg

Let's use these current statistics as a baseline. Yes, if and when Bitcoin takes over in 10, 20, however many years, this distribution may change. Today 0.7% of people are millionaires, but in the future that's likely to shrink, as we know the wealth gap is growing.

We'll also use the current value of 7.53 billion people. Again that is always growing, but for simplicity we'll use today's value.

# Bottom Tier: &lt; $10,000

This represents 3% of wealth, and 71% of people.

21m \* 3% = 630,000 BTC

7.53b \* 71% = 5,346,300,000 people

.00011784 BTC per person

# Second Tier: $10,000 - $100,000

This represents 12.5% of wealth, and 21% of people.

21m \* 12.5% = 2,625,000 BTC

7.53b \* 21% = 1,581,300,000 people

0.00166003 BTC per person

# Third Tier: $100,000 - $1,000,000

This represents 39.4% of wealth, and 7.4% of people.

21m \* 39.4% = 8,274,000 BTC

7.53b \* 7.4% = 557,220,000 people

0.01484871 BTC per person

# Top Tier: &gt; $1,000,000

This represents 45.2% of wealth, and 0.7% of people.

21m \* 45.2% = 9,492,000 BTC

7.53b \* 0.7% = 52,710,000 people

0.18007968 BTC per person

&amp;#x200B;

Now there are countless unaccounted variables here. Aggravating and mitigating circumstances. For example even if Bitcoin ""takes over the world"", that doesn't mean 100% of the world's wealth will be BTC. Following [this infographic](http://i0.wp.com/money.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/all-the-worlds-money-mp-infographic-1360.png), only a fraction of the total wealth is ""money"", especially if you include derivatives.

So feel free to poke holes in this, but it's really meant to be just a ""what if"" thought experiment. Still, even if you add conservative or pessimistic coefficients into this Drake equation, it seems to me that if you have at least one bitcoin, you'll be just fine.

I mean, there are 36 million millionaires in the world today. But only up to 21 million BTC ever."
"**Today is 12 March 2050.** Today is my birthday. I’m now 67 years old. My alarm clock goes off at 06:30. With a groan I wake up, and reluctantly kick away the warm, heavy bed sheets. I put my feet in the cold slippers below the bed, and shuffle to the kitchen, yawning. I pour myself a cup of hot surrogate [chicory coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicory). The cool morning makes me shiver, it looks like winters are getting colder each year. **We heat up the house as little as possible.** We're too greedy to enjoy comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

The bitter taste of the chicory makes me grimace, as it does every morning. Sitting at the table, I enjoy the first rays of sunshine that fall on my weather-beaten face. Our house comes alive with noises: on the upper floors I hear laughter and kids running around. My two sons descend from the stairs. The oldest checks the status of our solar panels on one of our computers. My youngest son looks at another screen, to check the status of our *farmbots*.

&amp;#x200B;

Musing about how things used to be, I look at my sons. When I see them, my heart fills up with pride, but also with compassion. They’ll never know the comfortable life that I led up to my 36 years. **Yes, the world is climate neutral now, but we paid a price for it.**

&amp;#x200B;

The big change started in 2019, with **two unfortunate events** that happened together: the Brexit, and the impeachment of Donald Trump. But the first seeds of the destruction of our society had been sown a lot earlier, [in 2009](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f).

&amp;#x200B;

Brexit happened on 29 March 2019, and gave cause for great political tensions within the UK. The classical parties where torn apart or became irrelevant. After a series of chaotic elections and re-elections, the extreme right-wing party [Norsefire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsefire) came to power. The country went into a dark and deep recession, but this gave Norsefire only more power and control over the citizen’s daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

In October 2019 came the other scandal: Donald Trump, the president of the United States, had already been executing for 3 years secret orders from his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Apparently Putin had been blackmailing him with a “golden shower” movie, in which Trump played a [not very presidential role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolagnia). The impeachment procedure was concluded in less than 24 hours after the start of the scandal. **The next day came the well-known effect: a Wall Street crash of epic proportions.**

&amp;#x200B;

The fall of the Dow Jones also made the stock markets in Europe, London and Japan tremble and shake. In London the bank Barclays went bankrupt. Millions of UK citizens suddenly couldn’t reach the pounds on their savings accounts anymore. However complicated the explanation given by economists was, the simple fact remained: **the money was gone.** Of course, bloody riots ensued. Politicians were slaughtered in horrible ways. A bitter-comical news item I remember from those times, is the story of [David Cameron](https://www.theweek.co.uk/72848/where-is-david-cameron-as-clock-ticks-down-to-brexit) asking political asylum in Cuba, where he was on vacation. (The demand was denied and he was deported to the UK).

&amp;#x200B;

**In the midst of these turbulent times, a monster reared its head from the darkest depths of the internet.** Bitcoin. 

&amp;#x200B;

In their fearful search for certainty, the British converted their remaining Pounds in Bitcoin. Soon their entire society ran on a black circuit of Bitcoin. The British Pound wasn’t worth a penny anymore. The value of Bitcoin however, rose to unseen heights. And that did not pass unnoticed in the rest of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

To save the paralyzed economies of Europe and the United States, the policy makers only saw one cure: inject massive amounts of money in the economy. However, this only drove the value of the Dollar and Euro downwards, and the good savers finally followed the panic investors, into the ever-growing mighty tentacles of Bitcoin. The network had by then been declared illegal, but this had no effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Life in a society with a deflating currency is strange, if you look at it with eyes of 2019. First of all, you will try to avoid spending money as much as possible. **Why buy a coffee today, if you can buy two tomorrow?** This reasoning caused a global shrinkage of the economy. Investments where postponed. Vital items, such as fruit, vegetables, bread, medicines, rose in price. Superfluous items remain unsold. Factories producing those closed. Hundreds of millions of people lost their job. And for the first time in centuries, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere diminished.

&amp;#x200B;

A second effect of this unregulated currency is that nobody payed taxes anymore. The government became poor.

&amp;#x200B;

This made our society evolve to an ultra-liberal society. The right of strongest, richest or luckiest ruled. National and international laws where of no significance anymore. Citizens organized themselves via the internet, and [local groups took over the tasks of the failing government](http://www.g1000.org/en/). Carrying arms is now taken for granted. Justice is no longer done in a court of law, but in online forums, where the majority votes for the verdict and the punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Together with the failure of the government, came the failure of the energy grid. People switched over to local production, and storage of energy. First with diesel generators, but soon with solar panels and batteries. Even though the price of oil was extremely low because of the global recession, still people preferred to buy solar panels. They pay back their value, whereas the value of a gallon of diesel – once it’s burned – is gone forever.

&amp;#x200B;

The discussion on nuclear power, which had been very actual only years before, became a joke. How could a failing government ever find the necessary funds to build new nuclear plants?

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime I have, as most people, retrained myself to farmer. It’s not a heavy job, robots do most of the work. But it’s also no luxurious. We mainly eat bread, vegetables and fruit. We only eat meat once a year. The slaughtering of the sheep is always a festive occasion.

&amp;#x200B;

**I have accepted this existence now**, and can also see the pretty side of it. There are no more superpowers, waging war. They simply do not have the money to buy bombs. The gap between rich and poor is closing, albeit very slowly. A poor man must simply save harder and spend less than a rich man. Since the money is gaining in value, this strategy works, although it will take many generations.

&amp;#x200B;

**My son’s generation was too young to see the decline of our society as something abnormal.** They are optimistic and strong, and look for creative solutions to the problems of these times. Health care is extremely expensive. Insurances no longer exist. If you’re seriously ill, you’ve got bad luck.

&amp;#x200B;

**It’s especially the millennials, people who are born around the year 2000, that are unhappy in today's society.** They remember a youth full of opportunities and dreams, that have all vanished now. Weekend trips to Barcelona or New York are a distant dream today.

&amp;#x200B;

I often discuss with my wife if things could have been different. She thinks: yes, if the Brexit and Trump-scandals hadn’t happened. I see things differently. The seeds of the decline had been sown long before. **The fall of our society was inevitable.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I wake up from my reveries,** and join my sons. We’re going to check our *farmbots*. Each armed with a rifle, we get on our bikes. I put in the headphones of an mp3-player, a small luxury I permit myself. A song from a long time ago, the [Rolling Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqMl5CRoFdk).

"I am looking to get some bitcoin, ripple etc and am wondering what are the best ways to buy it and keep it.

I’ve had in the past but well read on.... 

When bitcoin first came about I bought very early when the first white paper was released and even mined it, but then moved put my pc’s into storage as we were moving around a lot and tbh completely forgot about it.

To be honest even when bitcoin thing really hit I’d completely forgotten about it, originally I’d printed out my codes on paper and printed a lot of them to make me think what are these strange things that there are so many of (it didn’t work) that didn’t save me though..  when moving in 2016 the wife got my papers and shredded them thinking it was rubbish 😂

Anyway I won’t be able to find any of that the pc’s and hard drives were wiped and formatted due to corruption and we smashed them up when moving as they contained sensitive data (that was before I remembered 😂) anyway, easy come easy go as they say, there is really no point crying for what I never had. 

As I pointed out in the beginning I am looking to put some money into crypto probably more ripple than bitcoin as I think that has huge potential and is probably the future. (Just my view) 

Too many people who bought bitcoin have done similar to me and too many have been lost, there are only a finite supply.

Ripple is probably better in this respect and designed to be more stable, mainly because they are aiming at banking sector and money transfers. I think it will take time but it will hit the 5.00 + mark sooner or later. The only thing with ripple is I have reservations of who is behind it due to their past involvement in other crypto adventures gone haywire. 

But the big weakness of crypto in general as I am well aware is losing it... 

So I am looking for the best ways to buy and to store.

Ideally I would like to be able to use my phone (iPhone).

I am not that savvy these days as to what’s what so asking for the advise of those who hopefully do know...

"I’m sorry to say that I have had a very negative experience with [https://coinmixer.es](https://coinmixer.es/) and would strongly urge people to steer well clear.

I tumbled an admittedly small amount of BTC to try them out and identified a few glaring issues. I am still trying to resolve this issue with [support@coinmixer.es](mailto:support@coinmixer.es) and they have been less than helpful.

I set mixed coins to be returned to three of my addresses with delays of 1, 2 and 3 hours. When nothing had come back, I contacted support and was told there was some error. Even now, (the second time I have seen this) their so-called “Guarantee Letter” does NOT verify as signed. At all. I checked their Public GPG Key 0x698149872A32A8BD – which I cannot find on any Key Server bar their site. This is another red flag.

They have given me some rubbish excuse that they had some issue or other with their server and asked me to send the guarantee letter, my Operating System and wallet software used. Explaining that I use Electrum, they sent me some suspicious looking code to enter into the Electrum console, promising me that this would immediately fix my issue. I understood it was to sign a message and let them know that the output Addresses were mine. Unsurprisingly, the code spat out an error, suggesting (unhelpfully) that I contact support! I think they have a cheek to expect me to cryptographically sign my emails to support when their own “Guarantee Letters” are completely worthless!  
The output of “`$gpg2 –verify guarantee_letter.txt`” sent back:  
`gpg: [don’t know]: invalid packet (ctb=0a)`  
`gpg: no signature found`  
`gpg: the signature could not be verified`.

I then attempted “`$gpg2 –list-packets guarantee_letter.txt`” and got:

`# off=0 ctb=ff tag=63 hlen=2 plen=19 new-ctb`  
`:packet 63: length 19 – gpg control packet# off=21 ctb=cb tag=11 hlen=2 plen=0 partial new-ctb`  
`:literal data packet:`  
`mode t (74), created 0, name=””,`  
`raw data: unknown length`

I have now sent them back an email which I have signed with all three output addresses. To date, I’ve received no response.

I’ve sent a transaction (txid:[60657f2f08813f9e5708e68e3c79dd56e29c0bf5b07f94bd5e0b9c320bc21a6e](https://chain.so/tx/BTC/60657f2f08813f9e5708e68e3c79dd56e29c0bf5b07f94bd5e0b9c320bc21a6e)) now with the OP\_RETURN “Stay away from Coinmixer.es” and will continue to send similar transactions to the BTC Blockchain until they resolve this for me.

In all, a wholly unacceptable and unsatisfactory experience. Save yourselves a lot of trouble and stay away from these."

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nyancoin/

www.nyancares.org

Nyancoin has been around for 5 years, and is well known around cryptocurrency circles. Since it's launch, it has quietly operated and traded on exchanges with a small loyal community. In late 2018, part of the community decided that NYAN should be shared with the world and grown. In the face of ICO's and ERC-20 tokens being launched and forgotten, we feel many of us have gotten away from why we are involved in cryptocurrency in the first place......to change the world. The next generation is upon us. The hundreds of millions of children that watched NYAN Cat on Youtube are now turning into teenagers. Our intention is to share NYAN with this new generation.

Now more than ever, it is important that we have conversations about cryptocurrency, to move away from banks and their monetary systems and give people the power over their currency. Nyan is one of those currencies. We have been around for 5 years.......and we are just getting started.

NYANcoin Timeline 2019 We have a great cryptocurrency that is listed on two exchanges and a blockchain with people mining the coin and maintaining it. We intend to build on it. Here are some of our future plans;

Feb 2019 - Launching online training course to help people be financially independent.

March 2019 - Social media outreach program.

March 2019 - Launching mobile app with wallet solutions to make spending and receiving NYANcoin easier.

April 2019 - 1st Annual NYANcoin Spelling Bee - We will be launching our first NYANcoin ""Spelling Bee"" in select Canadian schools where students earn NYAN for participating. It will be an annual event that we intend to grow around the world. In 2019, we will be promoting this to students in Grades 6-8. This will not only help us promote NYAN but also encourage students to learn. We want to ""brand"" the NYAN cryptocurrency with students and be their first ""base"" cryptocurrency.

May 2019 - Launching NYAN ATM program with plans for 5 new ATM's per month. These will be located in convenience stores near high schools and in community centers so youth do not have to visit undesirable parts of town to buy/sell cryptocurrency.

Summer 2019 - Beach promotion tour.....we will be at the beachs across Canada all summer promoting NYAN......watch for us!

Summer 2019 - NYANcoin good deeds program.........each summer we will offer students NYAN for making a difference in their community......this will include spending time with their grandparents, cleaning up their communities and giving back.....more to come on this as we approach summer!

FALL/Winter 2019 - School is starting and an entire new generation in starting classes......we will be continue finding outlets for the next generation to use NYAN, continue growth of NYAN ATM's and launching a service organization. We will also be active in at the University level promoting NYAN.

Christmas 2019 - Crypto under the Christmas tree? In North America, we are launching a Christmas promotion with a major retailer to put NYANcoin under the tree of millions of people this holiday season, which will make NYAN the most popular cryptocurrency for Christmas 2019. Stay tuned, it's going to be great!

NYANcoin is a peer to peer currency. Sharing it is our main goal. Let's change the world together!"

1) first mover 2) BTC pairing on exchanges 
3) Price speculation 4) Liquidity 

Moon boys and Lambo dreams will come to a halt. 

What is the point of BTC if no one wants to spend it??
Bitcoin has become a fat plug of money socked away into digital code that no one wants to spend because it could be worth more one day... Its pretty sad 🤦‍♂️"

"The last three times I bought BTC with the Coinbase app, my debit card has been charged overseas shortly afterward. I had to cancel my card and dispute the charges three times in a two month period because of this. Has anyone else experienced this problem?

In any case, I’d like to buy BTC instantly for use. Where else should I try?"
"I'm looking to buy bitcoins using my debit card.

From what I understand there is a 10 day waiting period to transfer bitcoins outside of Coinbase if you use ACH/bank account.

If I use a debit card to buy bitcoins will I be able to transfer bitcoins outside of Coinbase immediately? My understanding is that this is correct but I want to make extra sure."

"Yesterday I prepared a transaction in Electrum and then took the signed transaction data and broadcast it using a different application. I saved the transaction data on my device, and noticed that it's a plain text file including the private key associated with that coin as well as some other information. As of right now, Electrum displays the payment using a computer icon instead of a green checkmark and, in place of the date and time of broadcast that my other transactions have next to the green checkmark, Electrum just says ""Local."" When I hover over that transaction, it displays ""0 confirmations,"" but when I right-click and say ""View on block explorer"" the block explorer says the transaction has several confirmations. What does this information all mean? Can my saved copy of the transaction be safely removed? Why doesn't Electrum see that the transaction has confirmed?"

"Lately I’ve noticed a lot of comments and questions about how people are able to live entirely on bitcoin. Particularly, in this subreddit, many users seem interested or willing to try living on the bitcoin standard and “burn the boats” on fiat currency altogether.

This is an admirable goal and one I think we should discuss mote often in the bitcoin community because education is a powerful tool for financial independence and allowing us to starve the debt-slave fiat currency Ponzi scheme.  

Would people be interested in following a sort of “Living On Bitcoin Series”?

I myself have come very close to living entirely on bitcoin by negotiating with my landlord to accept bitcoin and using prepaid bitcoin credit cards. (such as WireEx and LocalCoin)

Here are a few things I am curious about:

1. Would people be interested in learning how to live off bitcoin and following someone who is actively doing this?

2. What kind of updates and how often?

3. What would the operation procedures be? (must always use bitcoin directly or can use 3rd party services, prepaid bitcoin credit cards)

4. How would the campaign be funded? (Donations/subscribers)

Thank you for all consideration on the important topic for bitcoin. 

I will check back on it later. "

"Just some food for thought.
  
BTC went to $1 and then crashed down to 13 cents.  Another time it went to $100 and crashed down to $15.  Another time it went to $1K+ and came back down to slightly less than $200.  Another time it went to $20K and fell to $3K.  Each time of the 'crash', it's still a much higher low.  Bull and bear markets are normal cycles.  This is one of the longest bear markets we've seen.  There *will* be another bull market.  It's what the market does.
  
While everyone is shouting out $1500 BTC, I'm extremely confident we will never see those prices, ever again.  In fact I think in the next 3-4 years we touch $100K and then ""crash down"" to $20K.  And then the next panic cycle begins.
  
Relax.  Remember this is new technology.  It needs time for adoption.  A lot of time.  Tech always does.  Give it another 10 years and, if by then, we're still at $4K-ish, I'd be a bit more concerned.
  
I think time is running out for people to accumulate.  For those who were here from $1K all the way to $20K, do you remember just how many people were begging for these prices?  ""God if it was just $1K or even $5K again I'd back up the truck.""  And now it's here and people are worried and afraid to touch it.  These are the times you buy.  Not when it's peaking, but when it's bottoming.
  
*Disclosure:  This is not to be taken as financial advise.  I am not a financial advisor.  These are just my personal opinions that I wanted to share with the community.  I'm seeing a lot of toxicity here as of late so I felt this was warranted.

"I want to share my strategy in anticipation of the coming bull market. We all know that in the next 3 years some key alt coins will outperform Bitcoin in terms of % profits. Some alts will net you 50x what bitcoin would in the next 3 years. 

However, when the bulls are back in town, Bitcoin will be the first to moon. Bitcoin is always the first to go and break through our past resistance levels. Once Bitcoin reaches the next paradigm, then Bitcoin holders sell their coins for their favorite alt coins. 

Thus alt season begins. 

Personally im holding mostly Bitcoin, once bitcoin goes parabolic ill sell for some alts im keeping an eye on. Being a 2017 newb i didnt know better ways to maximize profits and take advantage of the Great Bull Run of 17. I didnt even have a gameplan. 

What youve read is my strategy this time around,  let me know what you think. If you care to, please share any ideas for the coming months."

" *Invest Online Share Price This can be defined as investment price. In business there are basic thing you need to do before you start up, those things are the key requirements for what you have in mind. Some of these requirements are capital, assets which could be inform of machinery, that is if you want to venture into production, and premises, that is, the land, building where you operate from, and personnel, that is your labor union, which constitute the man power. However, in business that has to do with share investment, you do not really need all this. At these types of business you allow your money to work for you. Instead of several other needs for business, you are only giving out your capital. The input you make at every investment, determines the level of output you always get. Depending on the number of share you hold your output can be up to 50-70%. Online share investment is one the processes that removes the bottle neck that surrounds this security business. This is because you can always make investment from the convenience of your home, office and region without having to travel very far. In fact, the payment system is so good that you can always withdraw at your convenient time with the help of your information communication devices. 87056*

"Hello Reddit, We released an all-you-need-to-know guide on Bitcoin ETF's. We would love any feedback. Here is a small excerpt from the article.
&gt; How do Bitcoin ETFs Work?
&gt; Now that we understand how normal ETFs work, we can turn our attention to Bitcoin ETFs.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. ETFs that Physically Hold Bitcoin
&gt; This type of ETF is almost identical compared to the ETF model we’ve described.
&gt; 
&gt; The only difference is that APs have the option of sending over baskets of cash instead of Bitcoin. This is simply for convenience as many APs don’t want to purchase Bitcoin and hold on to it themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; So when the AP sends over a basket of cash, the ETF provider trades the cash for Bitcoin. Then the provider returns ETF shares that are of equal value, less transaction fees, to the AP.

We would really appreciate it if you check it out [Here](https://www.hodlbot.io/blog/overview-of-bitcoin-etfs)"

"I have written to numerous forums with literally no responses and it is impossible to reach someone at Electrum. So I admit to being a bit frustrated at this point. I am new to bitcoin wallets but have been on Ubuntu for years. Downloading and installing from terminal was relatively uneventful and I was able to get a verified signature. Everything seemed fine on setup. After depositing funds at a Bitcoin ATM, the transaction was confirmed at blockchain.com and I double checked the address. No one has taken it. But my wallet just won't connect to ANY server. I have tried manually connecting to a server disabling the auto connect feature. The best I have gotten is ""synchronizing"" otherwise ""not connected."" I have tried entering server addresses specifically to no avail. I have even tried resetting my router in case there was a problem at that level. Nothing works. 

I got the download from the official website. It was the latest version (3.3.4) and it was two days ago. Again, I got a verified signature. I have been reading like crazy everything from Electrum,  bitcointalk.org and going over everything I've done to make sure I didn't have a misstep. Others have had similar issues but they appeared to respond to troubleshooting. I am at a loss. What else can I do? From what I read, creating a new wallet would screw everything up or at the very least be a huge nuisance. And since I really don't know how this works, is the money I deposited at the ATM lost since I can't get the bitcoin into my wallet? I deposited it yesterday afternoon. Probably a dumb question..."

However, there are rumors that this wallet is not airtight in security, and if someone, loses their Bitcoin from their wallet(even from their own stupidity) it would shed bad light on Bitcoin as a whole. And surely, if ever this takes place, it would be on every news outlet.

It's clear to me that the only way for us to be able to take control back from the market manipulators pushing down the price of Bitcoin is for us to all move our Bitcoin off these exchanges into addresses that we have a private keys for. Go ahead and take a look at it for yourself. Go on over to coinbase Pro and look at the BTC USD Market in real time .  You will see that there are people / bots just waiting to bring in huge sells with a hundred plus  Bitcoin  at the ask price only to delete it instantaneously and then push it down even further to the next lower price when there's not enough  purchasing power at  the buy side .  I believe that until everyone with any amount of Bitcoin moves their bitcoins from all the major exchanges to their own addresses that the price will continue to be manipulated in any way that these manipulators want it to via typical Wall Street financialization techniques. Big money is all over this market right now and they are trying to get enough Bitcoin to be able to control the market indefinitely. They're using ingenious techniques of market manipulation  with over-the-counter markets  and cash settled Futures to heavily manipulate the price of Bitcoin. This system has never been present in any of the previous bull or bear markets that Bitcoin has experienced and we are therefore going to have to make it our mission to spread the word about the importance of taking physical custody of  Bitcoin asap and avoiding custodial Solutions as much as possible. Otherwise they will continue to manipulate the price as they see fit to achieve their goals.

John McAfee, proprietor of the world-famous anti-virus software and bitcoin connoisseur believes that bitcoin has nowhere to go but up - even predicting that bitcoin’s value will breach $500,000 by the end of 2020 following his prediction model that left accurate results in 2017. He also claims bitcoin has “accelerated much faster than his model assumptions,” thus leading him to consider another view where bitcoin may hit $1 Million by the end of 2020. Moreover, Llew Claasen, Executive Director of Bitcoin Foundation has asserted that it is likely that bitcoin will reach the $40,000 mark this year, saying that cryptocurrency will be as “risky as it is exciting” ths 2019.

"Hello all!

I'm currently running bitcoin core and also trying out LND, on windows 10. 

I've run public nodes for a long time but now I want to learn more about tor integration. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2yzzmw/if\_you\_are\_not\_using\_tor\_youre\_bitcoin\_activity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2yzzmw/if_you_are_not_using_tor_youre_bitcoin_activity/)

Is this line really accurate?:  

* You must start Tor Browser Bundle before opening the wallet for it to work.

I currently have the tor browser installed, but it seems bothersome that i have to keep the browser open for the other programs to work. Do i really need to?

&amp;#x200B;

I also read this page in the lnd github: [https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/configuring\_tor.md#listening-for-inbound-connections](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/configuring_tor.md#listening-for-inbound-connections)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure what i want to do is to run a v3 tor hidden service,  they say here:

**If you want to run v3 Onion Services, make sure that you run at least version 0.3.3.6.** 

Currently, i have tor browser bundle v8.0.6, but i cannot find any information about which version of tor i have. Maybe someone can clarify the differences between the tor browser bundle and tor itself, i seem to have trouble fully understanding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to accept incoming connections, both through bitcoin core and lnd, to support the networks. If all I've read is correct, that shouldn't be a problem as long as i set everything up correctly?

Do i still need to forward ports through my router or will the tor hidden services take care of that in some other way?

&amp;#x200B;

I think i have found everything i need to put in the config files for bitcoin core and lnd, but i don't know how i can configure tor itself (if i even need to.) Most guides are for Linux and they mention a tor config file. Where does this exist on windows?

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any answers, explanations or links to guides. 

I'm sure some of you are running your bitcoin apps through tor on windows! "

"In [this tweet](https://twitter.com/MarkLundeberg/status/1108224908125827072), Lundeberg says that static addresses fix the problem of needed to always keep a copy of the latest channel state lest you run the risk of your funds being lost.

The Coindesk source says: 
&gt; Static Address for/to remote outputs: Aimed at improving “disaster-recovery scenarios” on the lightning network, Padiou explains that static addresses ensure easy fund recovery for users. “This feature – the static information address – means that with only the seed to your lightning wallet you would be able to recover the main balance in your channel,” said Padiou. The seed being a mnemonic recovery phrase attached to all lightning (and bitcoin) wallets, users currently require both this information and channel-specific information to recover lost funds.

Could someone explain like I'm a 40-year-old with a PhD in computer engineering and more than a decade of experience with distributed systems, how these static addresses work? How is it that you no longer have to keep a copy of channel state? What are the limitations of these static addresses? Or is Coindesk full of shit and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/pierre_rochard/status/1098222798546354177?s=21) still applicable?

(P.S. I chose to ask on Reddit first since this forum is more accessible. If this doesn't work I can always go to the lightning-dev mailing list but I'd rather have more technical details be more readily accessible to the masses.)"

It really helps for the rare occasion that someone has questions about Bitcoin for me and how to use it in practice.

Next step is to split the seed phrase into 3 equal parts and make some AB-BC-AC cards to put in different places.

Maybe I'll print them with my 3d printer, or get a laser engraver and do them that way on metal cards.

"So Dr Doom is not stupid after all, he might just be uneducated! 😊

I also found the same to be true with most otherwise educated people I discussed Bitcoin with. They are not stupid by any means, but they just fail to see the value proposal of Bitcoin, which requires basic understanding across many disciplines, such as economy, computing, cryptography, banking, and more. While consistently complaining about rising prices, most of them were even unaware of the mechanisms behind inflation."




"Okay so I'll start but saying that I believe that the reason Bitcoin is not consistently going back up even though transaction volume remain similar is that manipulation has over run the market to many bots not enough actual people those same manipulators seem to have more cash than the average Joe I say this because the transaction volume meeting the 18k Bitcoin Mark or higher with less reputation built up than currently (people didn't know) so their was large money from bulls  now the bears have more money than those same bulls because increased adoption so the question is

Is the price down because of a few people with alot of money? We know full countries and billionaires are playing this game here maybe someone like Bill Gates or Rothschild just sitting here accumulating doing dirty deeds on the block chain so to speak even being technically conspiracy it may be possible we all know the Rothschild's got hands in Banks globally and accused of many dirty deeds

Obviously this is speculation and theirs little if any way to prove it and I'm concerned that if someone did they'll disappear like many others

"Leaving the bears and bull out of the equation, it is irrefutable that the crypto bubble is already too big to ignore. The crypto market is currently worth more than half a trillion dollars, which equates to \~10% of the $5 trillion that is in circulation across the globe.

The unprecedented exuberance of cryptocurrencies has established them as a viable way of fundraising for start-up companies. Besides establishing themselves as an effective fundraising tool, cryptocurrencies also gave birth to a variety of scams as there were little or no regulations involved.

The absence of any explicit legal framework around cryptocurrencies will only create chaos which is why it is imperative to have certain regulations in place to make the token creators accountable to an authority.

### Blockchain spring

According to a report published by [Dappros](https://www.dappros.com/), a London based blockchain consulting firm, India succeeds US with over 19,627 blockchain developers while the US has nearly 44,979 developers as of October 2018.

&gt;*This essentially means that India can easily get an edge over other countries when it comes to captivating from applications based on blockchain technology.* 

Although the blockchain spring can be attributed to the growth of cryptocurrencies, the technology has the ability to revamp many fields such as VR, real estate, database management along with many others. 

Emerging economies like India can capitalize and see tremendous benefits from the application of blockchain technology in diverse verticals such as healthcare, agriculture, VR, real estate, database management along with many others.

### The Indian take on Cryptocurrencies

Although the Indian government has an approving view for the blockchain technology, the regulatory bodies have been contemplating on ways of dealing with the potential AML/CFT and consumer protection issues related to cryptocurrencies.

India’s cautious approach towards certain elements of the blockchain*,* such as cryptocurrencies and digital assets has not only hindered the crypto spring in the country but also has driven global VCs and Institutional investors out of the country limiting the exposure to the regulatory risk involved with cryptocurrencies in India.

This prudent approach has made it difficult for crypto-related institutions in India to operate. Global investments in the blockchain ecosystem have been considerably low in India due to the uncertainty revolving around crypto regulations in the country.

&gt;*While the legalization of cryptocurrencies in India could be a game changer for the crypto industry globally (adoption-wise), Indian regulatory bodies have been hawkish on cryptocurrencies lately.*

Despite the uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrencies, the Indian government has set up a committee to look into prospects and consequences of legalization. 

### To sum it up…

Although there is no official statement or declaration by the government of India on legalizing cryptocurrencies yet, the authoritative bodies have made it clear that the government is heading towards devising legislation that will potentially provide better cryptocurrency protections for “the common man”."

"Dear members of the crypto community,

**TL;DR: Uninstall Moon, Revoke your Coinbase API Keys NOW and PROTECT YOUR BITCOINS**

I am the co-founder and CTO at [https://paywithmoon.com](https://paywithmoon.com/). Due to the unethical business practices Moon Technologies, Inc. has been engaged in, I have left the company.

As of today, the moon browser extension manipulates the DOM of all our users' browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience, one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency. Over the past couple of months, my co-founder, Kenneth Kruger, has ordered the collection of data belonging to our users as a way to improve customer experiences. None of our users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt-out of tracking, a feature which I regularly insisted should be added. If you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under [https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/](https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/) (dated 26 Feb 2019), you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions.

From the moment you install our browser extension, we know exactly what pages are open on your browser, what the content of those pages are, and what you are doing with them.

The biggest and most alarming issue of all, is the process of collection of how our browser extension works in the backend - Coinbase API keys. From the moment the user initiates the connection between us and Coinbase, we watch for changes in the user's current window, waiting for the user to complete the one-time passcode (OTP) verification process as required by Coinbase. Once that is done, we programatically click the required permissions (scopes) required to create the API key as Moon sees fit.

The API key is then shown only once on the next screen, but the user does not know this (done via CSS manipulation). We extract the API keys into our backend, stored in **plain text** on our database. This is a definite security antipattern as I'm sure many of you know. **This API key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user**.

When I asked my co-founder why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking IAM policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have **personal** access to our users' API keys, my co-founder constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect our users.

Only two days ago, I have been locked out of my organization accounts including AWS and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users.

**If you are a user of our browser extension today, \*\*\*PLEASE\*\*\* you need to uninstall the browser extension via*****chrome://extensions*** **and go into** [***https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api***](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) **and revoke ALL your API keys NOW.**

If you have not used the Moon browser extension, but know of a friend that might, please inform him or her to do so immediately.

My deteriorating relationship with my co-founder has grown to a point where it simply can no longer be contained. You can read more about my experience in another post here [https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what\_to\_do\_in\_the\_event\_you\_get\_zuckerberged\_in\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what_to_do_in_the_event_you_get_zuckerberged_in_a/).

I had created Moon as I was crazy enough to think I was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency, accelerating the future of the financial system. However, today is truly a sad day for crypto. Until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations, the no-accountability attitude and greed many executives possess, we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency.

Until we meet on the moon again, please be safe, not sorry,

I should delete Coinbase because they are using Neutrino, a blockchain analytics firm, which is run by the same guys from Hacking Team, (who got pwnt) and their work with ""authoritarian governments"" like Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia (longterm US allies).

&amp;#x200B;

So we have a new standard in the community: **stop using exchanges who use unethical blockchain analytics firms who have people who work with authoritarian governments**.

&amp;#x200B;

But which ones are the good guys? And are there some governments we are okay with sharing data with?

&amp;#x200B;

As an aside: what about Google and Twitter and their Saudi, Chinese connections? Not authoritarian enough?

&amp;#x200B;

For bitcoin financial firms,  it is almost impossible to get a bank or fight off regulators without being able to claim that you use some &lt;insert blockchain analytics firm here&gt; and do timely responses to law enforcement requests from a variety of """"authoritarian"""" governments.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore I have a few reasonable questions just to clarify where the line is on this new rule:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Which governments are ""acceptably authoritarian"" such that we do not mind to have blockchain analytics firms reporting our data to them? 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Which blockchain analytics firms are ethical and do not report to ""authoritarian governments""? Please list the ""okay"" ones.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Which exchanges or other bitcoin financial firms are using blockchain analytics firms to scrape customer deposits and withdrawals? If so, which firms are they using and how do they use such firms to ensure there are no ethical slipups? 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has answers to the three questions above it would be very helpful to understanding this new rule.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"

"Looking back through history, we can see how the hardness of a society's chosen currency was a good indicator of its technological prowess.

The roman empire had its currency, the solidus, a coin which remained largely unchanged for over 800 years, with its supply tightly controlled and protected by the Roman Empire, enabling it to maintain one of the most stable and longest running systems of society humanity had seen. Only when it's government chose to begin clipping the solidus, where they would cut a few slices from coins in circulation, then reforge those offcuts into more units of solidus, while still telling everyone they were worth the same amount. Within 80 years of doing this, roman society fragmented and dissolved, ultimately breaking apart into numerous new territories, ending the roman empire. Is it coincidence that the manipulation of the currency happened so close to the empires demise, or did playing around with your society's nervous system cause it to arrest?

At the dawn of the 19th century, we saw the evolution of currency into a very scalable printed note, beginning with a limitation linked to a hard asset, gold in this case, which over decades was ultimately abandoned as the method by which your currency supply would be controlled. Over the course of this gradual disconnection, we saw the emergence of currency that could be created at the will of whoever was controlling it. The controllers of this new currency, our governments, granted themselves permission to print currency and actively devalue the moneys value, in the pursuit of that nations chosen interest. This led to currency that could be weaponized, used to have access to all of your citizens wealth, and being able to direct that kind of power is very powerful indeed. This new seat of power will inevitably draw corrupt interests towards it, interests not distinctly against the native population but ones who will disregard everyone in their pursuit of power. Printing currency, and its value, enabled government institutions to choose who would benefit from this newly created currency, usually making whatever they were funding loom like a benefit for society, but the reality would also contain corrupted influence proportional to its value. With this mass currency creation, vast economic action was enabled, by constantly being able to steal the value of currency from your citizens and direct it towards any task that could benefit the country while helping out your close beneficiaries. This led to creation of cities larger than any other before them, rapidly expanded typically at the expense of their citizens, as can be seen with the conditions some of the world's population who live within them.

Seeing these two examples, what kind of society can bitcoin enable? Could we the see the rapid emergence of a new province governed by truly democratic money? Could we see the emergence of the worlds first billion person city?

A global EMP is unleashed onto the world and all electronics don't work. An economic collapse ensues and all fiat currencies's are worth nothing (As most fiat currencies are debt based and are literally printed out of thin air by banking elites, the very cartel Bitcoin is meant to challenge). 

Suddenly the value of land, precious metals, food, clean water, and shelter skyrocket as grocery stores are looted of the remaining stock it has. You can picture this scenario as the greatest global crisis ever witnessed.

Would Bitcoin be a store of value such as gold in this case?

How would miners mine and nodes operate to keep the Bitcoin network running in a total blackout scenario?"

"So I'm new to all this, but i recently bought a bitcoin on cash app and I spent around $20. when I came to the confirm screen it said that the exchange rate was 4,032. So I bought it and after the transaction it told me that my bitcoin was worth 19.75 and so I was surprise being they don't take a cut when you buy or sell and I didn't think it would drop that fast because now the exchange rate is at 3,934. However if I go to buy another one just to see the exchange rate again, it turns out it says 4,032 on the buy screen but 3,934 on the sell screen. Does this have anything to do with timing of the exchange rate or when they take their exchange rate for the day or something."

"# Blockchain is a Lie — Just Another World Run by the Rich

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jylc66ffg1j21.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Image: Bitcoin billionaires, The Winklevoss Twins

&amp;#x200B;

Follow the Money

&amp;#x200B;

More than just an alternative business model, blockchain represents ideology — a system in which the individual is no longer at the mercy of dominant institutions that control the flow of power, money, and data. If blockchain deteriorates into another world run by those who control the majority of the assets, it’s intent has been neglected and it has no reason to exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Within chains managed by Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms, this is the reality. Users tout decentralization, rights of the individual, abandoning banks and more, but then fall into a system promoting the very same values they are rebelling against.

&amp;#x200B;

PoW and DPoS are plutocracies in disguise. The former is at the mercy of firms that can afford the most hashing power, and the latter suppressed by those with the most currency.

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever can afford to mine the most controls the flow in PoW systems — there’s no room for the individual with a starter setup having a say. Either invest a years salary or get lost. In the DPoS system, the irony is even more baffling: the people with the most currency ultimately get to write history.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this still the blockchain world we want? Trading one system controlled by a ruling minority for another shouldn’t be in the discourse.

&amp;#x200B;

Steadying Blockchains Ideological Path

&amp;#x200B;

Blockchains growth will remain stunted unless the focus is shifted away from Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake based consensus algorithms.

&amp;#x200B;

The November BCH hashing wars that produced two new chains via hard fork, BCHABC and BSV, left many speculating over governing issues within the PoW world. Differences in principles have made this side of the blockchain vulnerable — anyone with a large enough following is able to hold everyone else hostage. Chain sustainability isn’t guaranteed due to the ease in which conflicting parties can force a hard fork.

&amp;#x200B;

Those that preach DPoS put our future into the hands of 21 supernodes — corruption practically hard coded into the EOS genesis block. Everyone yearns for profit and power, making the have-nots pawns in the game controlled by those at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l5cgsdjjg1j21.png

&amp;#x200B;

A Blunt Account of Blockchain Management

&amp;#x200B;

Blockchain governance is defined as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

“The ways in which collective action can be achieved by public communities and key stakeholders — particularly those regarding the revision of past agreements. “

&amp;#x200B;

In view of the lack of a decentralized and de-identified digital platform supporting the “one person, one vote system”, the governance of the chain is often seen as a plutocracy — currency and computing power are king.

&amp;#x200B;

According to an article written by Vitalik Buterin, blockchain governance systems must be innately anti-plutocratic.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only is on-chain coin-based governance inconsistent with user interests, it is also antithetical to the ethos of public blockchains. The blockchain is for the public, to serve the public interest. It isn’t for cryptocurrency whales to get more rich. Cryptocurrency holdings (like wealth in global society) is highly concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people. The blockchain isn’t supposed to be owned by anyone… nevermind by a small group of super rich individuals. — Buterin

&amp;#x200B;

The interests of those who hold the wealth and those who actually use the blockchain are inherently different.

&amp;#x200B;

In theory, blockchain could provide an equal playing field where the world isn’t controlled by large institutions only acting for profit and belittling the rights of individuals. When power becomes concentrated by those holding the most currency or with the most hashing power, users who continue to praise these systems are working against their own interests.

&amp;#x200B;

The culture of blockchain implies egalitarian management. Anything else must be abandoned.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/llrp89klg1j21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Either we want it, or we don’t

&amp;#x200B;

The current state of blockchain is a farce. Either we want a new system where power is decentralized, or we don’t. Pushing the ethics of the centralized systems that have shaped our world for the worse within the blockchain space only perpetuates the virus that is elitism — sucking world of its resources and milking the chain for every satoshi it’s got.

&amp;#x200B;

The increased amount of ICOs in 2017 gave hope. Surely the competition would have promoted further developments — someone would have realised the bad traits trickling into blockchain- but only disappointment followed.

&amp;#x200B;

What should have been the start of a blockchain renaissance, turned into a money grabbing free-for-all, with scams, poorly designed products, and reckless teams becoming the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

But we do want it, we really do. We want the system as it was intended to be: quick, decentralized, egalitarian. A platform on which to build the next era of society.

&amp;#x200B;

This stepping stone comes in the form of Bitconch. Backed by Turing and Nobel laureates, offering 120,000TPS, anti-plutocratic governance, and an ecosystem based on egalitarian values, Bitconch has the speed, security, and morals needed warm the Crypto Winter.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitconch Solves the Issue of Governance

&amp;#x200B;

The Proof-of-Reputation (PoR) consensus algorithm developed by Bitconch creates a quantified reputation value (Bit-R) based on three dimensions: social behavior, currency holding time, and community contribution. Users with reputations within the top 5% then have an opportunity to take part in the consensus. This system more accurately mirrors the natural world — individuals who are more trustworthy, contribute to their communities, and build relationships with those around them are incentivised to continue doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Money and the size of resources are no longer a consideration, which dissolves the power that the elite have over governing the chain and eliminates the possibility of bribery. Instead, there is room for devoted lower and middle class users to take part in the consensus, making the chain maintained by the people and for the people. The conflicting interests of currency holders and chain users, therefore, does not arise.

&amp;#x200B;

Reputation makes for a conscientious ecosystem and reduced conflicts of interest supports ecosystem sustainability.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/92zao21sg1j21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Bitconch Solves the Speed Bottleneck

&amp;#x200B;

If the speed of the platform is not scaled to the needs of the users, usage will ultimately fall flat. A blockchain is meant to be used, and chains with slow speeds are simply not practical.

&amp;#x200B;

BLAZE (Bitconch Ledger Access Zero-delay Extension) allows for the simultaneous verification of multiple blocks through factoring the operation into five unique yet concurrent phases — fetching data, decoding, hashing, stating the change, and finally writing data. When BLAZE is coupled with PoR, the Bitconch platform offers 120,000TPS — making it a platform able to support extensive amounts of traffic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hsjrc0dtg1j21.png

&amp;#x200B;

However, the current focus of the blockchain world should not be on pushing TPS speeds as high as possible. Developers and users alike have lost their way, once again falling victim to the very plutocracy that catalyzed the emergence of blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

The ideology producing these platforms urges for the rights of the individual over the concentration of power in a few. It doesn’t matter if the flow of money is controlled by a few institutions in the current global economy or by a few mining firms in the blockchain world — once power is taken from the individual, we must dissolve the system."

"I am posting this on a few Bitcoin forums so we can get help for my dear friend Stephanie. Currently she had a death of a child and cannot afford funeral expenses for her daughter. 

As of today we had raised around 500$ from local businesses in our area from collection jars and around 68$ on GoFundMe. Stephanie was a married stay at home mother of three before loosing her husband last year to a drunk driver. She has two children now and works 2 separate jobs trying to support them and barely making monthly rent. Stephanie's beautiful daughter ashley, age 11, past away on February 18th, 2019. Ashley reminded all of us how fun our child hood was in Erie. It was a tremendous loss when she left our community. To help Stephanie is our last chance to do something to show Ashley how much we loved her.

Anything will help Stephanie and all the money received will go towards the funeral expenses. If, any money is left over, it will go to supporting her family. Stephanie knows that her hometown community has been taking donations for her but, she keeps going to work and not taking the time off needed. We personally think she should be taking all the time she needs to get the support desperately needed thats why our community is doing everything we can to try and make things easier for her. 

We are using coinbase so, all bitcoin will be converted into cash an then withdrawaled into a PayPal account for Stephanie. 

Please,  If you can donate even 1$, .50¢ please send to:

Bitcoin transaction will be converted at night every few days and, added in together as one total to the GoFundMe Page. Donation will say Sent from ""Bitcoin Community"".

"Hey guys, I'd like to organize a Bitcoin Meetup in my city, Aguascalientes Mexico, and I was wondering if people here would like to give some advice or point me to some resources that could help.
Even though I've only known about bitcoin for about a year and a half, I'm pretty passionate about it and I've educated myself with Andreas Antonopolous books and countless other resources, so I think I'm pretty capable of hosting some learning sessions.
I think I have the expertise and mentoring side covered with myself and anyone else who volunteers for it, I just need to find good ways to promote it and spread the word.

"Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I've known about Bitcoin since early 2014, right after the time when BTC crossed the historic $1000 mark. I learned about Bitcoin the same way a lot of curious folks did back in the day, Silk Road. I learned through Silk Road that Bitcoin was a global, uncensorable currency but didn't understand the intricacies of how and why Satoshi made it that way. I bought about 1 BTC through localbitcoin via cash and spent it all on ""good stuff"" at Silk Road. I bought and spent almost 10 BTC over the next two or three years.

That's when I read the Bitcoin whitepaper for the first time and it dawned on me, the genius of Satoshi, why proof of work matters, why there will only be 21M BTC, how UTXO works etc. But by that time it was too late, the bull run had already started and I had 0 BTC in my wallet. I was upset with myself for a long time for spending all that BTC over the years but that's when I started saving to some day own 1 BTC for when the recession hits later this year. 

Today was the day I bought 1 BTC for around $3900 and I couldn't be happier. I just wanted to share my happiness with someone so here I am. I'll see you guys again later this year when the world is burning and we'll have out BTC to hold on to. "

"is it possible to setup a wallet that requires 24 hours before funds can be withdrawn  
AND be able to monitor for that transaction  
AND i have the ability to stop it within those 24 hours?  


to elaborate, here's a stupid example of how it might work, hoping there's a cleaner way to do it?:  
the UTXO is only valid if some special string exists in the blockchain 24 hours ago.  
to monitor for hackers, i could have a simple bot monitor the blockchain for this string.  
to block the transaction, i could instantly send the funds to a predefined 2nd wallet that i own (if the hackers got that wallet too then i'm in trouble, but it should be easy to secure since it's super cold and never used).

“In mid-November, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) underwent a hard fork, resulting in two chains. On November 20th, we announced the “ABC” chain would retain the designation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on Coinbase.
The competing chain, known as Bitcoin SV, resulted in a forked coin now commonly referred to as BSV. When the hard fork occurred, the BSV blockchain used the amount of BCH associated with an address at the time of the fork to determine the amount of BSV that would be allocated to the parallel address on the BSV blockchain. As such, the amount of BSV now available in your Coinbase.com account is the same as the amount of BCH that was in your Coinbase (Coinbase.com and Coinbase Pro) account at the time of the hard fork.
Coinbase does not support purchases or sales of BSV, so you cannot sell your BSV for fiat currency on Coinbase. You may send your BSV balance to an external wallet following instructions here.”"

Bitcoin is not a currency, its information. Hence its much better, it might be a way better medium of exchange.

2) In the end the medium of exchange would be energy, since time cannot. PoW is more about converting any energy into bitcoin. Through electricity.

For a digital currency its supercool... bitcoin becomes energy.

Hello friends, I am looking for people interested in participating in a challenge which is rewarded with bitcoins. If you do not know what one of these challenges is, they are usually images that have different messages hidden or things which if you manage to solve you can recover a btc wallet which you can keep. I am not the creator, the creator is an early adopter of bitcoin and I want to form a team to solve it, the reward would be divided equally. The people that I look for should not have a knowledge of something special than bitcoin, if they know about cryptography and programming in some better scripting language, but the main thing is to be perseverant, honest and creative. If someone is interested in forming a team with me, you can talk to me. Thank you (No, I'm not a scammer nor do I intend to steal private keys I only look for people interested in participating in a btcs challenge, something like 3301 cicada and that style, please do not comment saying that I just want to steal)"

"I often wonder how many people like myself it will take out of the \~7.7 billions humans to finally break bitcoin free from the tentacles of the legacy financial institutions who currently manipulate the fiat value of our currency via the bank backed exchanges, cash settled futures markets, and OTC markets.  When I say people me what I really mean is: people who dollar cost average bitcoin every month regardless of the price and then immediately transfer it to addresses that they control removing any potential for custodial shenanigans out of the equation ASAP (finanacialization, paper bitcoin etc).  Just how many people like me do you think it will take?  Considering that there are only \~17.5 million bitcoins that have ever been created, and the fact that basic economic theory dictates supply and demand determines value, how much longer do you think it will be until critical mass is reached by the dollar cost averaging HODLers who are HODLing their own private keys?  I would venture to say it will be sooner than most think.  

&amp;#x200B;

Remember folks, the whole point of BTC is for us to have a decentralized, immutable, censorship resistant currency of the people beyond anyone's control.  In order for us to maintain these properties it is essential that people download and run their own full node to be able to self validate their transactions without relying on any company  or government's server.  Help strengthen the decentralization properties of Bitcoin by running your own node and contribute to one of the most important evolutionary steps humanity has made!"
"I've said that since tether launched.

&amp;#x200B;

It is Illegal to produce digital equivalent of dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if that digital dollar is backed up by 1 dollar bill paper. But in tether's case that digital token is not even backed by paper dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically every time you create a digital dollar token and sell it for a paper money, is equal to counterfeiting money.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to be legal, you must destroy paper dollar bills every time you sell digital one. You cannot have both dollars in market circulation.

&amp;#x200B;

To be put in context, is exactly like i print money at my printer and sell it on market.

&amp;#x200B;

That my friends is illegal, no matter if that counterfeiting is digital or physical .

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you realize where you put your money! I have no doubts that will be ended badly for most of these coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Hold your bitcoins in your wallets wisely, or you gonna regret in the future."

"After a thought and some heavy duck duck going it is clear that every “money” used in civilizations of people was created (almost always as debt) and that in the creation the smallest unit of measure of that money was valuable. Whether a pence, a cent or a Satoshi... oh wait... —break for shower thought in the garage— Bitcoin is the first form of money who’s smallest unit of measure, to this day can not be measured in pence or pennies, only by the value given by those who hodl it. The symbol for 1 Satoshi is freedom.

"I have come full circle. 

Since my involvement in Bitcoin in 2012, I believed that evangelizing and ""spreading the word"" about the technology was key. I've changed so much since those heady early days. It's nostalgic in a way. Like looking back at a much younger, immature version of myself just a few years in the past. 

And that circle back had lead me from being a rabid supporter of everything positive in the community to a fierce critic and advocate of alternative viewpoints. Every member of this community who is wrapped up in the price of Bitcoin, in getting rich overnight (you won't), should instead try to use their knowledge and skills to constructively criticize and provide feedback to every development in this space. People need to learn that a technology like Bitcoin thrives on adversity, I have come to observe. Through all the fork arguments, the back and forth, the challenges, the demeaning comments, the insidious players in the space, all of it, has only shown that wrestling with Bitcoin gives it practice in anti-fragility. 

Every junky, clanky UI decision, every busted lightning node and wallet, every questionable decision by devs, all should be analyzed and busted apart with every ounce of constructivity that we can muster. Challenge viewpoints and provide critiques, remove yourself from blithely pumping prices in public. Wrench yourself from the human tendency to detach yourself from reason when you are financially and thus, emotionally involved in something that should have no part in capricious emotional appeals. 

If Bitcoin truly is anti-fragile as we often say, then break it. Make it live where it was born: the cauldron of fire that is the warzone of internet security. Make it thrive there and maybe, just maybe, one day, you will realize that dream that you had of being a part of an immensely successful cryptocurrency. But not before. 

By going on easy on Bitcoin, we actually make it weaker. Destroy it, if you think you have what it takes. "

"Liebe Leser,  
bei diesem Beitrag geht es darum, wie Ihr Bitcoin betrachtet. Als ich Anfang 2017 zum ersten mal mit Bitcoin bzw. mit Kryptowährungen in Kontakt gekommen bin habe ich gar nicht verstanden worum es geht und es nur als eine Geldquelle gesehen mit der man so par Euros verdienen kann. Ein halbes Jahr später, nachdem ich einige Bitcoins verloren habe ( durch Scams ), wollte ich wissen worum es eigentlich geht und hab mir einige E-Books und Bücher bestellt.

Was soll ich sagen? Ich habe die Bücher verschlungen. Vor allem das Buch von Aaron Koenig (Bitcoin - Geld ohne Staat) kann ich jedem nur empfehlen. Ich habe dadurch soviel gelernt. Wie korrupt das Finanzwesen ist und wie wir jeden Tag von den Banken und Staaten betrogen und ausgebeutet werden. Seitdem her habe ich die Eigenschaften des Bitcoins, wie dezentralität, im mein Leben eingebaut. Aber muss es jeder tun, der Bitcoins kauft/haltet ... usw.? Muss jeder der wirklich was mit Kryptowährungen zu tun hat voll und ganz dahinter stehen und Fiat abstoßen und sagen nein das ist das Geld der Banken und damit möchte ich nichts zu tun haben?

\-Ich denke nicht. Man sollte immer einen gesunden Mittelweg gehen. Kryptos sollten nicht Fiat ersetzen sondern ergänzen. Die Menschen müssen sich ändern, nicht der Markt oder das Geld. Menschen die Kryptowährungen nur dafür benutzen um mehr Fiat zu machen haben genau soviel recht den Markt zu benutzen wie Menschen die die ""Ideologie"" des Bitcoins/der Kryptowährungen angenommen haben. Immer wieder lese ich in Foren, dass die eine Seite versucht die andere Seite fertig zu machen. - Total Umsonst. Warum nicht einfach machen lassen? Vor allem der Markt der Kryptowährungen ist sehr frei (freier Markt). Klar können Staat und Großinvestoren Einfluss auf den Preis haben, aber auf die Funktion habe ich bis jetzt keine weltliche Macht gesehen, die darauf Einfluss hatte. Darum sollte jeder frei agieren können und keiner sollte sich gezwungen fühlen sich vor jemanden rechtfertigen zu müssen.

Jeder hat das Recht auf gutes Leben auch in finanzieller Hinsicht. Der eine will es so machen und geht diesen Weg der eine will diesem Weg folgen und macht deshalb dies und das.

Leben und leben lassen (Y)

"With the rise in digital trends all across the globe, we have seen a huge growth in the digital finance market spanning across all sectors. Be it electronic payment mediums or digital transaction platforms, electronic finance has never been so easier and convenient. However, the boom of cryptocurrencies managed to change the face of the entire digital monetary platform. Although digital assets could be bought and sold previously in terms of website credits or precious metals, the rise of an entirely different concept of [digital currency](https://masscoinex.com/) shook the foundations of every stock market in the world. People all over the world are trying to tap into this immensely successful and sought after digital currency and you too can cash in on the huge profits it has to offer. Read on to find out more.

The first cryptocurrency ever to be used was Bitcoin which was heard of back in 2008 when it emerged as a virtual asset with a monetary value linked to it. The currency gets produced as a result of ‘mining’ done by software engineers who try to crack cryptographic codes. This exchange medium soon became popular due to: 

**Security** as a medium of [transaction](https://masscoinex.com/). It uses a locked public key as a security system which essentially means that only the owner of the key would be able to send cryptographic transactions. Thus it defined the way for secure financial transactions which would prove impossible to hack due to additional security by cryptography. 

**Global** transactions can be carried out worldwide to anyone having a bank account and an internet connection. The process is completed in a matter of minutes and the person at the other end receives it instantly. It does not matter whether you are sending coins to your neighbor or your agent across the world, the process gets completed instantly.

**Anonymity** plays a lead role here. The identities of the people sending and receiving the currency would also remain anonymous. [Accounts](https://masscoinex.com/web/buy) of crypto coin holders are not registered to a real world account and thus people can carry out transactions without any inhibitions.

Transactions can be made without need of any third party authorization as we see most commonly on the gateway page of our banks. The owner of the currency would have sole access to his software which would enable him to carry out the exchange.

All these factors lead to a rise in the number of people carrying out trading via cryptocurrency and the [stock market](https://masscoinex.com/web/history) saw a huge growth in digital currency sectors. People were keen on investing in this future currency and investment gurus wasted no time in future predicaments of digital currency boom.

The information in these currencies are stored in formation nodes called blockchains. This ensures that the information can never be deleted or manipulated via a third party. This type of blockchain information networking led to the rise of different types of cryptocurrencies. Some of the popular coins in today’s market are [BTC (Bitcoin),](https://masscoinex.com/#fees) BNB(Binance), BCN, MKR, AE, PPT, MOAC, etc to name a few. All these are mined by different investors and which then source to the public online.

Today customers have a wide range of options from where to buy their first digital coin. A lot of companies and agents offer lucrative deals to people to lure them to sign up and trade with them. Although some of these companies may be legitimate, it can be easy to get schemed out of your hard earned cash if you do not approach the right trader. The digital currency market can be a very exciting place and with the right guidance one can easily start cashing in on the profits. However just like any [trading platform](https://masscoinex.com/), losses can be instant and can vary in magnitude from a few thousand dollar to millions. This is why it is advisable to approach the right crypto trader when making your financial decisions. 

We at [Masscoinex](https://masscoinex.com/) are committed to providing you with the right guidance and experience you need in digital currency trading. We are your one stop solution for all your crypto coins and trade investments. We provide you with the option of both selling and buying coins on our platform and customers get to choose from a wide and varied range of 50 plus coins. One simple sign up with us is all you need to get started in the world of crypto trading. We accept all major international credit and debit cards and have provisions for electronic transfers also. We welcome non KYC applicants also to come and trade with us. 

Being a global exchange for cryptocurrency, we are always up to date with the latest in digital stocks and currencies and have years of experience serving our valued customers. We have a low fee structure which is one of the lowest in the market right now and registration takes only about 60 seconds after which you could be fully experiencing the world of digital crypto trading.

Crypto currency for the first time in the history of the world has actually bought financial freedom for people. A survey showed that around 2 billion individuals around the world do not have access to bank accounts. Users over the world can now have access to their form of [financial assets](https://masscoinex.com/web/login) without fear of reprisal, especially in developing countries and the Middle East. The block chain technology which is one of the most secure networking protocols till date can be used in elections around the world where corrupt governments rig their ballot systems. 

A currency which has the potential to change the lives of people forever. A financial tool which actually gives people the power to control their money. That is cryptocurrency and now you too can take control of secure digital assets in a few simple ways. The crypto market is only beginning to rise and determined investors will find out what the digital future has in store for us.

"I'm looking to run my own bitcoin node as a hobby. I'd rather do it with a physical computer i.e. rasp pi than using AWS or other cloud services.

Are there guides on how to set one up on the cheap?"


"Today I was reading the Bitcoin whitepaper (not the first time). Made some notes on concepts like it's P2P network and privacy model. Also, I noticed that most concepts were derived from previous works. Hashcash and time-stamp server were heavily drawn from the references.  Pls correct me if I am wrong.

But the most peculiar insight was the fact that ""Bitcoin"" was not mentioned throughout the body.  
Any opinions as to why so?"
"Since the price for BTC is going back up, I'm seeing a lot of posts of the nature of ""I forgot my password"" or ""I forgot my mnemonic"" or ""I have 2FA but no longer have that phone"".

If you are investing in cryptocurrency, you should always assume that losing passwords, 2FA auth, or mnemonics will result in the complete loss of funds.  Exchanges may be kinder than offline wallets in this regard, but please never assume that there is some boffin somewhere that will magically be able to guess your secrets and return your funds to you.

Remember TOTP 2FA gives you a ""secret-code"" that can be used to recover your TOTP 2FA on another device.  I'd probably avoid SMS based 2FA, since you would have no way to move your funds if you were vacationing overseas on a foreign cell network when things go lunar.

At a minimum, get a password manager to store it all, and make the password something like your SSN so your wife or whoever can get to your funds if you bang your head surfing.

If you (correctly) think your SSN is not a good password, then create a cryptographically random password then store it with a steel punch on sheet metal, encase it in lacquer and bury it beneath the oak tree that you proposed to your wife under.

Point is... make sure that every lock you make can be unmade by your next of kin in the case of the zombie apocalypse.  If you don't have a good recovery plan in place... it's ultimately your fault."

## Future plans
Currently you can only book a fixed size instance (a docker container with limited memory and CPU power) for exactly one hour. But depending on the feedback I get planning to add more features. I also plan to open source it at some point but the code needs to be cleaned up first.

"I come from a south east asian country. So most of you can imagine what the technology in there is/was like. 
To share you few actual stories :
1. we were the only house back around 13-15 years ago in our entire village who had a LANDLINE Phone. There used to be people who used to come to my house, give me the number they want to dial and request me to connect the call. The AVERAGE END USER couldnt dial the number back then, fast forward 15 yrs, almost every house now has a cell phone and their little children play online games on it. I got my first cell phone when i finished my 10th school and that was a NOKIA.

2. Now imagine the level of knowledge my Grandfather has. He is not a european or american guy who got exposed to tech. 20-30 yrs back. He struggled a lot to use his first cell phone. Now guess what, he can actually dial his number on his own. ( btw, he still cant save the contacts and needs my help. He is old enough so one can get why). The AVERAGE END USER/GRANDPA does his stuffs on his on.

I can make a lists of these which i have actually seen and experienced. And comparing all this stuff to Bitcoin, its really laughable when people say, the AVERAGE END USER wont be able to run their nodes pointing their Grandma.

Jihan was mining on proprietary hardware not available to the public. He made a business decision to fork Bitcoin to keep his machines viable. He thought community would just magically follow along to his side of the chain. Bitcoin Cash is a social engineering attack on Bitcoin. Satoshi's vision was Bitcoin Cash, in the sense that Bitcoin is open source software, and anyone at anytime can fork it for whatever reason. Is it a good idea to do so? No, you silo yourselves from consensus (remember community voted with nodes, hashpower, and an economic majority). Bitcoin will survive Bitcoin Cash. If Bitcoin as a community made the decision to change proof-of-work algorithms, or block sizes, or any other property of Bitcoin, we'd have to come into consensus, and softfork an upgrade. Everyone updates their nodes, and enough time passes for participants to prepare for said change. What Jihan did was very hasty, and not well thought out, and very much against the will of community. Jihan, deserves his punishment, an inferior version of Bitcoin. THAT can only ever be the legacy of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin was designed very intentionally to be difficult to upgrade. Community stayed within consensus rules. Bitcoin Cash forked off, and did their own thing. Any kind of fallout afterwards is the free-market at play. By the way, by the same stream of logic, Bitcoin Cash Satoshi's Vision, is ironically Satoshi's Vision. The rules are in code, and consensus, if you deviate that's on you, and anyone that wants to join you. There can only ever be ONE true Bitcoin. Lightning is innovative, it brings real-time payments to Bitcoin, AND is OPTIONAL. Main chain still works. There will be more innovations. If the Bitcoin Cash'ers truly believe on their side of the chain, innovate. Show the world what BIG blocks can do. Hopefully you'll need them someday."

This bot automates making markets on Binance.

Where  other market making bots fail (ie. BitMex, Deribit, other attempts I've  made in the past) is by counting on the market to not be volatile.  Where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits  in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself, where  on BitMex and Deribit these spreads ar 0.25$ of a BTC, some smaller  markets on Binance have 1%.. 2%... 5% spreads, and greater-than-average  volumes.

You'll  want to have about $20 per market pair it's looking to trade, in the  base asset (BTC, BNB, ETH, etc...). It will look to trade more markets  if the targetSpread, targetVolDiv, targetVolMult are higher. The more  total funds in a particular base asset there are, the higher value the  orders will have.

If  for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of  considered pairs, it will continue selling that asset with the same sell  logic (on the quoteAsset+BNB market), while pausing buying it.

I  don't have enough personal funds available to run the bot, but I can  get a good amount of income if I share it and people use my ref link.  targetOrderSizeMult exists so that people can compete using the same bot  on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot  constantly, as you can set a % of your order size to ignore when there's  a bid or ask better than yours. When the volume that beats your price  is higher than the order size \* this multiplier, it'll re-enter the  market.

\--note  that you should never trust your API keys to a bot without proper code  review. Nefarious people out there will use your balance to manipulate  the price of very low liquid markets and pick up a huge amount of cheap  tokens from your hard-earned crypto--

"Cryptomining requires vast amount of cheap electricity. So many miners from China, Korea and Japan come to Kazakhstan in search of reliable hosting companies. Here is short guide how to setup your own facility and run mining operations.

Check this steps and make sure you make your own research to find out more information:

1. Register company or open branch of your existing company. That will make negotiations with power plants much easier, as they not allowed to sell electricity to foreign companies. You can expect cheapest rate of $0.03-$0.04 per kwh. 

2. Loan/purchase facility/land. Average rent rate is $5 per meter square for concrete building. And in case you want to buy facility, it will cost approximately $200-$800 depending on condition and location. Regarding land it is more complicated to buy, but easy to loan.

3. Workforce is cheap, but unstable. Usually people are qualified, but not used to hardwork. So good management and control is needed. You can hire staff by posting ad at https://www.olx.kz/ or https://hh.kz/

4. Taxes and other fees. When importing equipment, generally, 12% VAT paid. Also, certificates and broker fee cost $500-$900 per invoice. Corporate tax is 20%, employers pays another 10% for pension fund and 5% social tax for employees. 

5. Everything for setting up data center is available on local market. I mean cables, switch gears, ventilation systems, fire alarms, etc.

6. Weaponed security is provided by local security companies, like Kuzet. You just need to clarify what you need and they will provide any services that you want.

It's just brief advice on how to start mining in KZ. Just what came to my mind. During last 6 months I locally visited lots of power plants. Main issue is investments in preparing infrastructure: building transformers, power lines to lower voltage to 0.4 kV."
I’m assuming this is positive news for cryptocurrencies?
"So I was tired of paying too much for tools that loaded all of my financial information onto their servers, so we built a tax prep tool that runs entirely inside the browser. All of the data-sourcing, calculations, and exporting to PDF/Excel happens in the browser, so almost none of your information ever touches our server.

The tool works with 120+ exchanges, all cryptos, trades between cryptos, and correctly handles trading fees. For now USD is the only fiat supported.

We made this for the typical person that simply wants their capital gains calculated using standard FIFO rules, with no annoying limits on number of trades, all done at an affordable price.

[The tool is available here](https://blockpath.com/taxprep), with *unlimited trades+transactions* at a flat rate of $20.

I would also like to offer a free upgrade to the first 10 people to PM me their Blockpath account names, in exchange I just ask that you just [post here](https://blockpath.com/pages/CryptoAccounting/comments/3b/announcing_blockpaths_tax_prep_tool/) to share how it worked for you.

If you, a beginner have seen my last post of bitcoin generator sites, then you have the obvious question of “how do I get free bitcoins” and no I am not talking about bitcoin faucets that give you negligible amounts of bitcoin and make you have to get a lot of referrals. Do you want to know the best way to get free btc, well lets get right down to it. Also If you are a beginner and want to store your bitcoins safely I suggest using Exodus wallet because of its simplicity or going to bitaddress.com and making a paper wallet.

1. Survey sites!, the good folks on r/beermoney can help you find even more websites to get free  btc, but if you answer surveys and polls on sites like Grindabuck you are eligible to get payed in BTC, and the payouts in this website are pretty quick, another way is through getting giftcards on other sites and exchanging them for btc on local bitcoins, Hodl Hodl, and Paxful, some of my favorite sites to do this are PollPass and Crowd tap.
DISCLAMER for these sites, some survey and poll providers are looking for specific candidates and demographics and so getting or qualifying for surveys can be hard and such some people will get money faster and some people not so much.

2.  Donations! This one is not so guaranteed, if you have an online project you are planning and people like it, consider putting your bitcoin address to net donations, you can also do what a guy did near the chair of the fed and put up a sign with your bitcoin address, he netted $16,000 of BTC, same thing happened to me but on a much smaller scale, I put my address in one of my last posts and got $0.02 of BTC, don’t know where it came from but I have a suspicion it was from someone on reddit, so try putting you address in next social media posts if you are popular and if you become popular from that post then you might be getting some donations your way, it is not that simple however and you may not get that many donations, I’ll leave my BTC address if you want to donate though which is 1HRDHMgos6VuYS6HhuyDSvndYrjKcXM8JA

Now you know how to get your first dollars in BTC absolutely free.

I chose the folder it had been previously referencing (the location changed) and figured it would see the old blocks in there, sync up and then download any missing blocks, but it looks like it redownloaded the entire chain, and I have a huge bloated folder twice the size of what it needs to be.

Any suggestions? Should I clear the folder and start from scratch or is there an easier way that anyone knows? Thanks."

Theorem: There is no Bitcoin exchange where your Bitcoin is safe.

Proof: We show (1) that no Bitcoin exchange can be both in set A and in set B, (2) that any Bitcoin exchange outside of set A is unsafe, and (3) that any Bitcoin exchange outside of set B is unsafe.

1) Define set A as the set of Bitcoin exchanges that suck up to government regulation, copying each other's policy changes in hope avoiding government seizure.  Define set B as the set of Bitcoin exchanges that honor the principle of not retroactively changing verification policy for existing users.  A and B have a Ø intersection: any exchange in set B cannot also be in set A.  This comes from the realization that some set A exchanges are always upgrading verification standards, like Gemini.  Since they (i.e., any of them, since if one does it, the rest by definition follow) retroactively apply these policies, the set B exchange will not be able to follow suit without leaving set B (by retroactively changing verification policy for existing users).

2) Crypto has left regulators unsure of what to do.  These regulators look for ""leaders"" in self-regulation, like Gemini.  When Gemini, or any other set A exchange, enacts a new regulation, the regulators will find those who do not follow to be in violation of KYC/AML.  In cases like BTC-e and 1Broker, we can see that regulators will not hesitate to seize the domains of exchanges that do not follow suit.  Thus, if you put Bitcoin in an exchange g outside set A, it is possible that a set A exchange will enact a new regulation that g does not copy (it doesn't have to because it isn't in set A), in which case it is possible that g will be sieged by governmental organizations for KYC/AML violation.  Since g could be any Bitcoin exchange outside of A, all Bitcoin exchanges outside A are unsafe.

3) Suppose that you are readily available to comply with all regulations in set R.  You choose an arbitrary Bitcoin exchange x outside of set B with regulations Rx, where Rx is a subset of R.  As times passes, verification technologies improve, regulations change, and old verification technologies become obsolete, it is inevitable that the exchange will enact a new verification regulation r\*.  Since x isn't in set B, there is no guarantee that the exchange won't retroactively hold you to r\*. Also, there is no predicting whether r\* will be an element of R, so it is possible that you will be unable to meet r\* if it's retroactively applied to you and thus unable access your Bitcoin from exchange x.   Since x could be any Bitcoin exchange outside of B, all Bitcoin exchanges outside set B are unsafe.

Why does it make up so many transactions on the bitcoin blockchain? What is it securing exactly? Which blockchains are using it and who is paying for the transactions?
"Always wanted try to jump on bandwagon since 2015 but too lazy to search how to jump in. Decided to start slowly. Bought with 200€ in august 2017. Shortly after price rise i went partly in with next 2000€. In september i went into bank and walked away with 16000€ loan without giving any reason to borrow money. My wage is like 1100€/month after taxes. I have changed limits on my debit card to unlimited amount transacted. You dont know the fear and uncertainity when you send +-14 paychecks to coinbase and after that to trezor... paranoia at 120%... just at first half of december 2017 everybody mentioned taxes... my GF told me to take out money to have good sleep and pay down the debt. At this time i had like 3,67 btc. Ok i took out 1,2 btc and repayed the debt and bought 1080ti with btc. It was dirt cheap card at that time in terms of bitcoin ... I have taken out slightly less than i put in to pay 0 taxes...   I thought iam doing wrong thing, i swear i saw realistically  hyperbitcoinization and moon landing during 2018.. 25k, 50k, 1M was totally clearly visible in next few months... i had mental breakdown about collapse of financial system, bilions of dead people who didnt see that coming and not prepared... spent one week at hospital. After this i was left with 2,3 btc. Left it untouched for whole 2018. Also stopped hypnotizing charts. In the meantime I was saving fiat and last month decided i need to reach 4 btc to have calm sleep. Now with only mine cash. Right now iam again at 3,5 waiting few months to give it last push to get into 5M club at 4,025 btc. I hope i will reach it before summer.

**Dont do this guys. Put only money you already have into bitcoin. Good sleep is better than fear of having debtbomb ticking at your head.. dont watch price daily. Once a week is enough.  Dont be debtor, get rid of all debts imidietly. House, car, cc... Also buy physical gold. Iam at 200g. Goal is 1 kg. Downsize your lifestyle and learn how to make fire and shelter, how to grow food. Get a licence for owning a gun. Learn basic technology like on YT primite technology. Be prepared that one day the venezuela scenario will come to usa and eu even if that it seems totally unlikely. Be prepared for everything... we will se in next few years global downturn. Dont own any debts even its seems stupid to not take them. You are then only slave. Be sovereign and selfsustainable. Be your own bank, provider and educator.**

"Yesterday  I lost all of my Bitcoin because of an Electrum phishing scam. For over  a week, (before they released the update) every single Electrum user  has been vulnerable to this attack. I dont know how an attack is  conducted, but it comes from *within the Electrum wallet.* When  I tried to send a transaction, a message popped up that said something  along the lines of ""you cant send a transaction until you update to the  newest version."" This message links you to github. This was my fatal  mistake. Do not download versions of Electrum outside of their official  website.  
I  downloaded this new software and tried again to send my transaction  with this version. Immediately after ""sending"" my transaction I knew  there was something wrong. I didn't take long for me to discover that  the developer had announced that the wallet was vulnerable to a phishing  attack YET AGAIN.  
This is far from the first time this has happened to the Electrum wallet. Take a look at [r/electrum](http://r/electrum)  and Electrum's twitter. There is a clear history of vulnerabilities.  With almost every update, a vulnerability is discovered and more people  lose their money.  
What  budding developer in their right mind is OK with people CONSTANTLY  LOSING BTC TO PHISHING SCAMS WITH EVERY UPDATE?! In my opinion, it's an  irresponsible or blatantly evil one.   
If  the Electrum developers felt a lick of morality or responsibility for  their users' BTC, they would find a way to make significant improvements  to the security before allowing anyone to send transactions or they  would find a way to force people to move their BTC out of their wallets  so they could shut down the app for good. Instead, they allow these  scams to happen time after time again.  
This  leads me to believe that the Electrum wallet itself is a well-organized  scam. The world of cryptocurrency is a lot like the wild west right  now. It would be extremely difficult to put the blame on the developer  because I was the one who clicked the bad link. BUT I do have to say,  that link came from WITHIN THE APP, meaning that it should be the  developers responsibility (through coding and proper security) to  prevent these types of scams from happening. There was no way of me  knowing that the popup message was legitimate or not.  
Additionally,  I'm sure theres some Terms of Service I don't know about that says  Electrum isnt responsible for lost coins. This completely frees the  developer of all responsibility. They can literally do whatever they  want. They don't care about keeping our coins safe and it makes me think  they're actually out to take our coins."

" I just posted an in-depth article on Medium arguing that, despite the predominant narrative, Bitcoin maximalism is incongruent with libertarianism and that libertarians should reject it[https://medium.com/@daniilgor/libertarians-can-and-should-reject-bitcoin-maximalism-87223d215765](https://medium.com/@daniilgor/libertarians-can-and-should-reject-bitcoin-maximalism-87223d215765)

The key idea is that like the ideology of a certain strand of self-identified libertarians whose most vivid representative is Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Bitcoin maximalism is actually a manifestation of a broadly conservative approach to society. This approach conflates the means to a certain positive goal with the goal itself, focusing on the defence of certain transcendent features of a given social or technological arrangement.

I am aware that perhaps most people in this sub won't like what I wrote there. However, the article is written in the spirit of critical thinking and I invite you to respond to the points I raised with arguments rather than downvoting or personal attacks. Note that I am not at all arguing against Bitcoin as such, and only against maximalism. "

"I am a really Bitcoin maximalist.

But there is only 1 thing that i disagree and aware about developers that released bitcoin in public.

That is the reward programming in the core.

As you know and i show you in the chart by the end of 2011, 8 millions of bitcoins were mined.

From public influencers and known figures in the industry, only few people were before 2011 in this market.

The rest came after 8 mil bitcoins were already mined. Some of them lost private keys of wallets, but most of those stories came also after 2011.

This scares me a lot in terms of price stability and volatility in the future, knowing that only few groups that holding 8 mil bitcoins (especially core devs and some that readed white paper at right time).

8 Mil bitcoins = \~38% from 21 mil and almost 50% from today's supply.

Can you imagine if bitcoin goes to let's say hypothetically 1 million/Btc how those who own 8 mil bitcoins will affect prices in the future? They can literally drop prices to half whenever they want.

Why they did bitcoin reward like this? Especially when they could guess in the future that new adopters gonna lose their wallets by not knowing what they had in wallets? :)

They could make reward equally till year 2140, that way many people will lose their private keys but will less bitcoins in them.

I guess we can only hope that those 8mil bitcoins are in ""good intentions hands"" :)

Just be aware of how big manipulation can be in the future at any price, no matter if bitcoin goes to 10mil dollars, manipulation occurs from those who hold big wallets like the ones i just explained you. You can pour money in the market cap as much as you can, it won't stop volatility no matter how much money you pour in.

Those who says that if market cap will be bigger means volatility will drop... they either bullshiting you or they have no clue of how bitcoin was released.

" ""If the bitcoin price drops to a certain low that makes mining unprofitable it will lose lots of miners. Losing the miners make it more vulnerable to 51% attacks, if at this point bitcoin is attacked
It's price will drop further,
thereby losing it more mining power making it more susceptible to attack. At this point everyone will be struggling to convert their bitcoins to something else, thus further dropping the price.
But in fact we don't even need the price to drop for this to happen, when miners stop getting a block reward this will happen. It is inevitable."""

"&gt;This brings up the question of what a good price for Bitcoin would be. When will Bitcoin stabilize? It should become less volatile as it becomes more widely adopted because it will be harder for local events and individual people to affect the price very much, right?

&gt;Not necessarily. Although perhaps we will see less wild daily swings, I think Bitcoin is unlikely to ever attain anything like a stable price. If Bitcoin’s price were stable, this would mean that it had achieved an equilibrium with the other currencies. There would have to be some sweet spot at which there is exactly the right balance of bitcoins and dollars. When Bitcoin’s price went a little bit too high, people would start to sell for dollars, and when it went a little bit too low, people would buy more bitcoins.

&gt;To anyone who thinks this is possible, I ask why would any equilibrium happen? What would it possibly mean for Bitcoin’s price to be too high? Unlike just about anything else, a higher price for Bitcoin does not reduce its usefulness one bit. One simply trades in smaller amounts of it. In fact, a higher price makes Bitcoin more useful because a higher price indicates that more people want to buy, which means that Bitcoin’s liquidity grows, which makes it more useful as a currency.

&gt;Therefore, I would suggest that we should never expect an equilibrium between bitcoins and dollars or any other currencies. Instead, Bitcoin should show a pattern of hypermonetization. It will become more and more valuable at a faster and faster rate priced in terms of other currencies. Its price chart should show an asymptotic increase that approaches infinity after a finite time.

Bitcoin may stabilize in terms of real goods, but I see no reason to think that it will stabilize in terms of other currencies. Once Bitcoin starts killing the other currencies, it will still be volatile, and this will still be an indication of its success.

&gt;If my prediction is wrong and Bitcoin ever stops being volatile, that might be a good time to dump it.

"Hi everybody,  


I wanted to drop by to quickly tell you about a project I've been working on recently.   
Like a lot of you, I'm super stoked about the upcoming release of Lightning Network enabled wallets like 'Zap' &amp; 'Lightning-App' from Lightning Labs. I was, however, a little disappointed when I learnt that these projects won't be supporting older generation iOS / Android devices.

I was able to spin up and host an LND node, to participate on the Lightning Network, but managing and using it lacked the simplicity and convenience of a native mobile wallet. To get around this, I wanted to create a rapidly deployable, web based solution that would allow me to connect to and manage my LND node from any of my web enabled devices. I wanted the app to look and feel as much like the next generation of native mobile wallets as possible, while still providing plenty of control over the core node functionality.   


I decided to package my solution as a WordPress plugin, and in the hopes that it may benefit others in the community, I have gone ahead and open sourced the code. I'll paste a few more project details below, or if you wouild like to learn more, you can visit the GitHub project page at [https://github.com/rstmsn/lnd-for-wp](https://github.com/rstmsn/lnd-for-wp) . I look forward to any thoughts &amp; feedback you might have...  


&amp;#x200B;

[LND For WP v0.1.1](https://i.redd.it/t4meoaljekm21.png)

&gt;LND For WP is a WordPress plugin that allows you to manage and use your  LND node, right from your WordPress administration panel. It provides a  fully functional wallet interface, allowing you to send and recieve  funds across the Lightning Network with ease. The user interface is  responsive and will adapt to fit any web enabled desktop, tablet or  mobile device. You can search the Lightning Network graph, manage peer  connections and open &amp; close channels with ease. The plugin has QR support, enabling basic encoding &amp; decoding of QR  codes. LND For WP also adds a number of WordPress 'shortcodes', allowing you to  embed LND functionality directly in your website pages and posts. New  Shortcodes will be added with future versions, as needs &amp; use cases  arise.

Quote 1

&gt;Widely believed to be the key to helping the cryptocurrency reach a mainstream audience by pushing it [to handle millions of transactions](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-the-lightning-network), lightning still has a lot of work ahead of it. First and foremost, it’s not exactly safe to use yet. No less important is that the user experience has its kinks. Namely, the current way of generating addresses for accepting payments is not as easy or dynamic as it could be for many use cases.

Quote 2

&gt;Though, very importantly, it’s not a perfect code implementation — not by far. Plus, the usual warnings about using bitcoin’s lightning network while it’s still early-stage definitely still apply.

Quote 3

&gt;The main drawback to this method is an invoice can only be used once. If a user were to accept a second payment to the address, the payment could be stolen.

Quote 4

&gt;A ‘hacky’ start  
While the code works, Osuntokun admits it’s “hacky” so far.

For sure these bugs will eventually be solved but the truth is for now LN is not yet production ready. It is in beta version. Most of the people seem's to think otherwise, they think LN is production ready, ready for mainstream use.

Not yet, maybe some day. There are plenty of work still to be done."


"&gt;  Outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than transactions per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves. Large players in the Bitcoin space use batching--the process of including multiple outputs in a given transaction--to reduce their overall transaction fees. Therefore, looking at only transactions misses an important part of the picture.

And:
&gt; 
&gt; When Schnorr hits, there will be even more batching of the transactions.

I know Brock Pierce.  I've known him for years.  His running over people is going to cost him now. I know his plan and here it is.  

&amp;#x200B;

\- He is posting news articles everywhere that are false in order to get the ""court of public opinion"" on his side.  He wants to apply pressure from low end outlets (eg, [CCN.com](https://CCN.com) which recently stated that Brock owns Mt. Gox) and use that pressure as a list of sources to get published on [CNN.com](https://CNN.com) and other more reputable sources.

&amp;#x200B;

\- He then wants to be able to use these numerous news sources as evidence to cite in the upcoming court. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- His plan is to create a ""concession point"" by stating that ALL proceeds from his new ownership will go to pay back prior Mt. Gox users.  However, here is where the catch is:  

&amp;#x200B;

THE SCAM  (2 parts) 

\- Those users will be paid back in the PRIOR value of BTC, not the CURRENT value of BTC.  For example, around the time it was $600 BTC or so.  Current is $3300 or so.  If we figure 200k bitcoins then Brock will net a $540,000,000 PROFIT

&amp;#x200B;

\- BCH hard fork.  The 200k bitcoins hardforked into BTC is worth about $24,000,000 that Brock will keep himself.  

&amp;#x200B;

This means Brock will profit $560 million USD!!

&amp;#x200B;

Brock has stated over and over again that he will ""pay back"" users, but don't be misled!

&amp;#x200B;

Also let us be clear:  Brock never owned Mt. Gox.  There was never an asset sale or a company sale.  There is no document proving this.  Nothing.  Brock says he has a ""Letter of Intent"" however even if he did have this, that has nothing to do with selling Mt. Gox.  An Intent contract is not an asset sale contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Brock has retained the services of ""Correct the net"" systems.  This means astroturfing of Reddit, Twitter, etc., are well underway.  BE AWARE of the pro-Brock army.  It is fully paid and not real and is only meant to sway public opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*THE BIG PLAN:\*\*  The reason why Brock is doing these public campaigns is because he wants a \*\*VOTE\*\* to be done via Mt. Gox customers.  He wants to build a vote list and bring this to court.  He wants to state ""4529 customers of Mt. Gox are in support of me owning it"" and this actually is a viable strategy.  He is misleading users.  He wants people to think ""Oh, I must vote YES or I will get NO money and Brock promises me money"".   As it stands now, Brock might win, so BE ACTIVE!!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The community needs to come together to apply pressure.  Email news outlets.  Talk on Twitter.   Raise awareness\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

If and when this comes to court, GET INVOLVED!  Testify that you reject that Brock owns Mt. Gox.  Even if it costs you some $$ that you would get.  REJECT IT!"

" Ways Means committee testimony on CSPAN this morning talked a lot about infrastructure funding today and it boils down to that there's not enough money to do what the country (USA) needs.  I got to thinking that it'd be pretty cool to invest in infrastructure bonds because investing traditionally in stocks and mutual funds go mostly to financial advisors and banks.  As a bitcoiner, I'm not here to debate the politics about how the gov spends its money, I just want to talk about how Bitcoin could be involved.

I never looked into this until today but signing up to buy treasury bonds is pretty simple (and a hilariously outdated website) and made me consider what it would take to buy a treasury bond using Bitcoin.  Obviously the Treasury department doesn't take Bitcoin so how do I get the perceived fiat value of my Bitcoin into Treasury bonds? Going through an exchange seems pretty backwards as the exchanges will still take fees (and paying taxes).  The key is to get value I want out of my Bitcoin as a government backed bond. P2P is the best way to get my value but how do i convince someone to buy a treasury bond for me and not run off with my Bitcoins?

&amp;#x200B;

Why not a time-locked transaction with somebody?  In this scenario I'd have someone purchase (or provide funds for) a Treasury Bond today and I'd send a Bitcoin transaction with a time-lock of the term for the security (lets say 1 year for a Bill).  The sample on the Treasury website would say a $10k Treasury Bill may be sold at $250 interest for the year.  I'd get the gov backed security at the end of the year and my buyer gets the Bitcoin (that hopefully is worth more by then) This doesn't sound too exciting for a Bitcoiner but we could look into longer contracts (and higher Bitcoin Prices).  Lets consider a security that has a longer term, lets say 10 years for an amount with more attractive interest.  This could work if my buyer wants to wait 10 years to get his Bitcoin (he'd get a steep discount for it if we believe where Bitcoin will be), but we could also create a smart-contract that would allow the 10 year time-lock to be reduced on certain conditions (can either be programmed or just done manually) such as if the market rate for the coin increased dramatically that the security would be transferred once the value of the security matches up with the Bitcoin.  I dont know what the gap between the market price of bitcoin and a treasury bond would have to be, would a 29 year $50k Bond be sold for only $25k worth of Bitcoin today or something?  It sounds like some fancy accounting math that the financial sector probably has already done  


Does this actually do anything? I'm not sure , but rather than tie the value of Bitcoin to only the magical numbers on an exchange, we could pin it down to Treasury Bonds too and hopefully the perceived value of the Bitcoin gets used for something rather than sitting around doing nothing waiting for the price to go up.  It kinda gets funky when people start swapping Bonds as Gifts using Bitcoin, would the government have to intervene if Bonds are transferred for Bitcoin? With services built on top of this, it will also allow Treasury Bonds to be purchased by individuals that may not have the ability to purchase them directly (such as those that aren't tied into the financial system due to lack of access, or just those that may have trouble acquiring US securities)

&amp;#x200B;

tl dr; would one sell Bitcoin at a higher market rate for a government backed security? Would one sell government backed securities at inflated Bitcoin prices?

&amp;#x200B;

"I have a simple question on my mind from a long time. What if central banks print all the money, use that money to purchase all the available bitcoin.

I know literally the consequences are due to demand the price keeps going up. But they can get them on OTC while suppressing the price by manipulating the media and other outlets with fud articles.

The other side effect could be they do not want to give too much power to existing whales to become central bank like monoliths of power. They could even print enough money to overcome that too.

Wonder why that is not starting to happen???"



"I recognize that a business mostly can not afford to have the payments that it receives become ten percent or more less valuable than they are regularly anticipating for their goods or services. That volatility word associated with bitcoin places a lot of fear in people, businesses too. So my understanding(I could be missing the whole picture; SMH) is that the current implementations(Starbucks BAKKT)being used are to accept bitcoin from customers and then sell most or all of it for fiat within a short time frame. That’s lame AF! 

If I had multiple successful businesses and established wealth, I would use the opportunity to implement the opposite model for at least one of them, I would accept dollars/fiat and make clear to my patrons that it would immediately be sold for bitcoin, as that is the preferred method of payment and security in futuristic global commerce.

The magnitude of bitcoins potential brings alarming realizations to the shitty way things are being and have been done. I have so many emotions revolving around the different understanding of money I have uncovered within my thoughts.

Do you think businesses should accept fiat and buy bitcoin? Or do you think they should accept bitcoin and sell it for fiat? Leave a comment below.

"Perpetual exponential growth of any asset would protect investors against losses and guarantee significant returns on their initial investments. This would be the ideal situation for any investor.   
  

According to this theory why not create a virtual coin, which has no intrinsic value, however it has an agreed upon increase in price, controlled by a single corporation without influence of the market (30% annually for example). To ensure a sufficient amount of circulation within the market you could implement a policy which does not allow owners to own a coin for longer than an agreed upon length of time (6 months for example). This would ensure that there are enough virtual coins to be bought. To ensure that there is enough supply the corporation could occasionally split the coins increasing the supply of the virtual coin, or simply introduce a new supply of coins, to meet demand. Demand would eventually be there because exponential growth is extremely attractive to investors.

Here is how it works. You open the wrong rar file with an unpatched version of winrar and a payload is dropped in to your windows start up folder. Which means on reboot you will load up an exe. 

And nobody ever updates their windows. And rar files are used op usenet and also in torrents.

"Hi peeps, with the current drama surrounding Coinbase I have decided to move my BTC from there and try something different. 

As I do not care (at this point in time) if my transactions are traceable I was thinking about keeping a HW wallet that I can take offline, and periodically shifting funds (boths ways) to an online wallet.

My main device for online transactions is an iphone and
I live in Australia so would prefer to deal with an online exchange that deals in AUD. I only deal in BTC and do not plan to buy other Crypto. 

Is this a good plan for a crypto noob? I am trying to keep it simple yet secure. So if there is a better way of doing something please let me know.

What Exchanges do other Aussies use? How have you found them?

Which HW wallet would you recommend? I was going to go either Ledger or Trezor.

Does Mycelium do everything it says on its website or is it still  in development (reviews on the App store are not great)?

TIA

"**Join Verity and earn some ETH by completing tasks**

Have some free time? Want to earn something on the side or join a promising blockchain project? Join a growing community of data-providers and earn ETH (Ethereum) and VTY (Verity’s utility token) by completing tasks on [**Verity’s platform**](https://alpha.verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin) and help us get truthful data.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Verity?**

In short, [**Verity**](https://verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin) is a decentralized oracle for smart contracts.

Using the “wisdom of the crowd” principle, where a large group’s aggregated results often outperform any individual’s estimate, and blockchain-as-a-court-system, Verity is the solution to the oracle problem by collecting, verifying, and connecting real-world, real-time information to any smart contract.

While Verity is blockchain-agnostic, it is currently on the Ethereum blockchain and has its own ERC-20 utility token with VTY as its ticker. At the moment, Verity is still on the Ropsten test network with a working prototype and the move to the main Ethereum network is planned by the end of Q1 2019.

To further validate the project, in Januar, 2019, Verity was accepted by the Network Catalyst Accelerator run by US venture capital firm, Village Global. Village Global is backed by some of the most successful company founders including Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn).

Along with the access to advisors, experts, and other investors through the accelerator, the backing also included a hefty financial investment. You can read more about this investment [**here**](https://verity.network/blog/verity-backed-by-village-global-joins-us-based-network-catalyst-accelerator/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin).

**What types of tasks can I expect?**

There are numerous tasks that are available on the Verity platform varying in complexity, duration, and rewards, including:

* Sports and eSports matches (football/soccer, basketball, hockey, CS:GO, Dota2, LoL, …) - tasks like who was the winner, what was the score, the play time, etc.
* Insurance claims - Whether a claim was valid or not, whether the package was delivered or not, damage of the product, etc.
* News sentiment analysis (crypto news for example) - Whether the article is bullish, bearish or neutral, etc.
* Fact checking - Fake news detection, inappropriate content, etc.
* Artificial Intelligence - Image and audio recognition, object categorization, handwriting analysis, etc.

And new event types and categories get introduced frequently to test the protocol and use-cases of the principle 

**How do I start?**

We prepared an in-depth guide that explains everything and helps you get started, including setting up your Metamask and account creation on the Verity platform. 

Read it [**here**](https://verity.network/blog/complete-guide-to-earning-on-verity-alpha/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin) and get started!

"I've got a couple days to kill and wanted to see the current state of the lightning network on mobile.  I've got an android phone and would like to set up a lightning wallet in a completely non-custodial manner that is as trustless as reasonable (I will not insist on compiling software from source code).  I also have an iPad if that would be easier, but I would prefer android as that is my mobile device.


I already run a btc node on my windows computer and have an eclair node set up on there as well.


I assume that the best way to have a functional, noncustodial mobile lightning wallet is to install a wallet on my phone that can connect to my PC, but I could be wrong and am open to other methods.  I am not interested in custodial wallets or wallets that use someone else's btc node.


I do not have a static IP, but if it is required, I can rent one from my VPN provider.


I have tried to search for a tutorial myself, but I have not found any that provide instructions for what I am trying to achieve.


If you know of a good tutorial, please let me know.  Moreover, if I have made a bad assumption, please point them out.


Thanks"

"I recently moved from NYC to upstate NY. From an area where there were Chase banks on every corner to an area where the closest Chase is 1-hour away.

I signed up with the most popular bank up here so I could have convenient access to ATMs. I kept my Chase account because I like the convenience of their online banking. So in order to funnel money from one bank to another, I need to connect them through their online portals.

Twenty minutes on the phone with their tech support. Several bugs including the need to click submit several times until error codes go away (without even changing details in the fields), an ""email verification"" that requests a code but the email includes only a verify button, and literally having to refresh the page and start over in order for changes to update on the browser side.

All that and the accounts still failed to connect. I now have to wait several days for verification deposits to reach my accounts and unlock the ability to transfer between banks. 

Anyone who says legacy banking is convenient enough has forgotten about the headaches and annoyances of setting things up in the first place. These are the types of things that Bitcoin will supplant when it matures."

"I love how nobody ever thought about using the language the name Satoshi comes from. Just use any goddamn character from the name it's さとし in hiragana and サトシ in katakana. I would simply use the katakana symbol for the syllable /shi/ シ

シ is the last character of the name, the satoshi is the last fractional digit in Bitcoin.
シ is the most recognizable among those.
シ is very easy to write by hand.
シ is already in UNICODE so you don't need to waste so many people's time by trying to push your pointless designs.
シ looks like a face satisfied and happy while looking how Bitcoin price moons.
シ comes from japanese just like the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

"I'm trying to send a transaction of $100 when I have $400 in my wallet, and it keeps saying insufficient funds over and over again. Not to mention I had to uninstall and install the wallet over and over again for a transaction to have actually went through. It is so awful. All I have is awful experiences using it. It seems like a malfunctioning glitchy wallet"

"So I never really thought about cryptocurrency until this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Some guy on instagram reached out to me and wanted to see if I wanted to invest in bitcoin alongside him. I was really skeptical about this because usually these guys don't reach out to you, you reach out to them. So I started talking with the fellow, and poking around his profile and stuff. He has 12,000 followers, which could just very well be paid bots. He also had testimony videos, that seemed generic and never really mentioned his name. In his profile however, he does show videos of him talking about his mining rigs, and setting up a new facility (in Syria, I think). I asked him for verification but he didn't give it, as it was supposedly used for illegal activity. He also has told me he is based in Georgia (country), and a website linked in his bio does say they have an office in Georgia.

&amp;#x200B;

So then I asked him how would I know if he's real? He replied with this: ""For you to believe I'm real, I will credit your mining wallet and the money won't be spendable till the server that did the payment receives the crypto you invest automatically it will become spendable. How much do you intend to invest?""

&amp;#x200B;

So eventually he sets up a blockchain wallet for me, then I get $500 of bitcoin off coinbase. That same day, I won $500 off a scratch-off ticket, so if I lose that money, it won't be as painful. I was talking with him and later I ask him what the process is, and he says this: ""Well the process it's all about mining more coins and trading for you which will generate the profit. Yeah no need for that again since you have bought we will mine, trade, and generate your ROI your wallet has been linked to the mining farm for that."" I also keep talking with him and he says the minimum investment amount is $500 for him because it depends on the ""miners platform.""

&amp;#x200B;

Two days pass, and my skepticism is still lingering, so I asked him how he wouldn't walk out with my bitcoin, and blatantly scam. He said this to me: ""Okay, I am a man and I know where I have come from, principles and discipline guides us. My word is my bond, I understand how you feel and trust me I did the same thing on my first investment, I was so scared, each palpitation in my heart was engraved with the words you might lose this but I looked around me and told myself I'll make it and today I am happy. I don't do such because I have something way better than that gives me enough money to settle my needs. Once I've mined and traded for you, you will get paid and I will collect my little commission that's how it works; both parties (Investor and the miner) earn after the process. So don't feel and think negative man it will work out.""

&amp;#x200B;

So then I send him the bitcoin and the value increased since I spoke to him. Eventually, he mined and traded then got back to me, and deposited bitcoin into my blockchain wallet, and he said due to the rise of value in bitcoin, my profit will be higher. I was only supposed to profit about $650, but instead got $4700. Eventually I authorize him to send me the coins to my wallet and I get a whopping 1.762 bitcoins. But it is labeled as ""non-spendable"" and it is waiting on 3 confirmations. I ask him about it and he says this: ""Yeah after confirmation it won't be spendable due to the increase in price of bitcoin it affected the servers so after mining and trading for you, the server credited your wallet with that high amount and for it to be spendable, you will send $2000 btc to the server making it the investment of $2500 and the ROI is what you just received then you will send me the miner's fee of $150 and service charge of $50."" So I was confused where $2000 came from, and he said this about it: ""the $2000 won't be a new investment it will be the balance of the first one I did that for you to see it's not a scam."" Then I talk to him about how I will have $4700 left after sending him the $2200 but he says that I cannot use it because it's non-spendable and it will remain in my wallet. And supposedly I need to buy another crypto and send it to that server, assuming it's the $2200. He then says ""Before it will become spendable after confirmation, you will have to balance the invest amount."" I ask him what the process is, and he says, ""Okay you will have to buy bitcoins of $2200 and send to the server to equal the investment balance and once it's received the whole money in your wallet becomes spendable.

&amp;#x200B;

So does what this guy is saying check out? And as I said, the 1.7 bitcoin he sent me is pending confirmation to be spendable (from what I understood on Blockchain's website), but it doesn't make sense to send him more money imo. He also told me to get Luno so I can send my bitcoin to the bank, but he has access to my blockchain wallet, unlike my Luno account, but all log-ins have to be authorized by me for blockchain, so if he tries to get in I can deny it. He told me he would tell me when he would need to log into blockchain. And guys, before you call me a dumbass that's getting scammed, I realize that, but I figured I'd ask the community because maybe it is true. Thanks for the help and sorry for all the reading."

"Hi, I would like to share something with my bank account. I was waiting for some invoice payment since December. I blame the company that they did not pay me at time. Today I found out that my bank freeze my account because they requested me some paperwork. They said that they send me letter in early February to notify me, but I did not get that letter. But because I did not know I blame the company. 

So I was very pissed off with the company who had to pay me and I had to make several call to find out that they actually send the money, but my bank rejected the incoming money.

I called my bank and they confirmed the rejected income. 

I had to apologize to the company, which is a very good client of mine. It was really embarrassing and this looks very stupid from my side. 

Now my account is frozen till I have the paperwork they request.

With BTC this wouldn't happen. 

Only wanted to share this experience and show that bank have us by the balls.

"Hot wallets have high fees, have a terrible security record and the transaction times are ass. 
I can understand why cold storage solutions exist and I am specifically talking about hot wallets like blockchain.info,etc
LN is faster and have less fees,
Now you might be saying that you only send very small amounts on LN, but you already store small amounts on hot wallets because of advice from experts that it is insecure.
I don’t know the security record for LN, but I think the speed is worth it.

"This is likely a noob set of comments but here goes:

Is a majority of the buy and sell wall movement up and down done by algos/bots or is this spontaneous organic activity?

When the volatility drops, this activity seems to jump.

Are these bots actually the same for multiple exchanges to manipulate the global price? It would seem likely in order to keep a trading range so tight for 3-5 days.

Am I wrong here or do these bots actually seem to make more money than actual major price movements?  Assuming you made money on the way up and down by controlling the market with your walls, is it reasonable to conclude that they are actually making money no matter the market?

Since the algo controls the upper and lower range by moving the buy and sell walls, the smaller investor is just guessing and getting lucky enough to buy at a price of his choosing and sell at a price of his choosing.  Sometimes you think it will go down further and it doesnt and therefore you miss your target.  The guy that is running the algo knows exactly how far up or down they are pushing so they make money for sure with each swing.

I have stuck in bids here and there for scalp trades but I recognize how you can end up being a bag holder here.

All of this seems to make trading almosg pointless for the retail investor or am I missing something.  If anything you could emphasize the benefits of a multiyear HODL based on the difficulty winning against the algos.

The more traders that jump in, the tighter the range for the bot seems to get until the risk/benefit for the average person becomes quite high.  You never know when they drop a buy wall and leave you a bag holder.

Since you and me dont control when the bot starts, stops, how it selects ranges, we are at a strict disadvantage.

Bots seem to trade in about a 50-70 btc range since they cant move the global spot price any further on a local exchange?

Some bot walls are so big, it looks like they could devour a sell resistance level on the exchange, but instead they use the natural sell wall that is already in place to their advantage.  Since they know they have sellers on the high side,  they dont even have to put on their own sell wall and take any risk.  They can use existing sell wall to buy at a lower price either way.

Based on the sheer size of some of these buy walls right now, can you predict that btc will actually blow past resistance or no? Just eyeballing things today, it seems like we could easily pop up 200 points if the algo owners decided it was time.  With the added cash they are amassing with the bot activitg, they prob have a lot of capital that they fleeced from someone or another...?

I sell bitcoins with pay PAL
" So around December 2017, I put in $300 in coinbase and I did not start selling it until like 2018 Jan, but as of now after trading it a few times, it's worth around $20. Should I bother to file those loss?

At this point, I just make fun of myself when I look into the coinbase app. $300 is nothing to me. Less than a day of my pay, but should i even bother to claim the loss?

I know if you win more than $600 it's required to file, but since I lost around $280, is it even required to file?

Maybe I will save myself $50-100 if I claim the loss, but it costs more to file taxes when I try to claim those loss.

And is turbo tax better or credit karma?"

So, I know Crypto ETF's keep getting delayed for approval. But there's an ETP from Switzerland that is essentially the same thing (as I understand), by the name of $HODL. I will likely invest in this and others like it. But the whole point of crypto is to not be stuck with Fiat currency. But I also don't have the time or emotional fortitude to be a day trader speculating on alt coins. Is there a program I can download that will use a computer program to just diversify and invest? Or even a website that will let you have a wallet that let's them invest it for you?

**What happened:** bitcoin-laundry.com will STEAL YOUR LARGE AMOUNT DEPOSIT!!!  


I searched for ""bitcoin mixer"" on Google and found this website.  


I created a session and got a deposit address, which is 3Fz3JW1RiNTYuSs8kwLGDZExPK7WgR2CTW, and the session is [https://bitcoin-laundry.com/session/fe236e1d5b07f5ac7adf32901a5ee4d39e4b5bfa179775da8678c32b77250603](https://bitcoin-laundry.com/session/fe236e1d5b07f5ac7adf32901a5ee4d39e4b5bfa179775da8678c32b77250603). Here is the screenshot in case the session expires: [https://imgur.com/CDLXiif](https://imgur.com/CDLXiif)  


After I sent coins to the provided address, I refreshed the page, and the deposit address surprisedly changed to another one 359cX3M8L8gb3X1SGPVdQH3EeJvQ5cCiuS, while the page still shows ""Waiting for Bitcoin"".

They attract users by low fee and work well for small deposit, but once you deposit a large amount of bitcoins, they just keep your coins and manipulate the deposit address to cheat you.

Hello,

There are no recent transactions showing on the blockchain going to the BTC address associated with invoice Kfq8n7wJj8amuDUFkkWsXa.

This invoice has expired. An invoice is only valid for 15 minutes. You can return to Paysafe Group USD if you would like to submit your payment again.
If you tried to send a payment, it has not yet been accepted by the Bitcoin network. We have not yet received your funds.

If the transaction is not accepted by the Bitcoin network, the funds will be spendable again in your wallet. Depending on your wallet, this may take 48-72 hours.

We also reviewed the transaction details you provided and this transaction does not belong to BitPay- (708a4a541b70334be2eab5258f059953fc0841760b3f9dfb985cca1004f31fd0).

For future payments, please review our guide on How to Pay a BitPay Invoice.

Please let us know if you have any more questions about this payment.

"Want some free BTC today? Here's a fun educational puzzle for anyone who wants some free BTC!

Here's the puzzle:

""What is something you can keep after giving it to someone else?"""


"1. Recently (on 2019-03-09) I came up with an idea for an app that would help bitcoin users privatize their bitcoins and untraceably send them to an address with no prior history. This idea is completely decentralized and involves zero trusted third parties. I think it would be much faster than other privacy solutions such as Wasabi and Joinmarket, and it could be especially useful for helping bitcoiners recover their privacy if they’ve reused an address or withdrawn money from a service that has their identity, such as an exchange. The only thing is, I don’t have the skills to do any serious coding, so I’m hoping someone else will take this idea and run with it. (I only know HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and this idea involves network communications and lightning, so it’s beyond my abilities.)

Front End Description

2. The interface for the app would be very simple. It would have two fields for user input. In field one the user would enter the amount of bitcoins they want to privatize, and in field two they would enter the address they want to receive their privatized bitcoins at. When the user fills out both of those fields and hits Enter, the app would process some data (see below), and spit out three things: an address to send their bitcoins to (generated by the device and fully controllable in Settings, not relying on any third party service), an amount to send, and a QR code to scan with their bitcoin wallet.

3. Depending on how the app is made, the amount the user needs to send would either be slightly higher than the amount the user said they want to privatize, to account for onchain fees and lightning fees (see below), or the app might tell the user how much and how many transaction fees will be deducted from the amount they entered in field one. Once the user has sent the full amount to the address indicated, different bitcoins would be sent to the address in field two and no one would be able to connect the user’s address from field one to the user’s original address, nor could anyone connect the inputs to the outputs. This is because the original inputs and the final outputs are part of completely separate transactions, set up trustlessly offchain.

Back End Description

4. How it would work on the backend is this. The app would use lightning HTLCs to swap the old bitcoins for different bitcoins rapidly, and it would set up the exchange trustlessly off-chain. The old bitcoins would go to someone else and the user would trustlessly get different bitcoins from a counterparty whom no one else can identify. Moreover, this process eliminates the need to wait for a bunch of other participants to do multisignature transactions with you, which is one of the downsides of other privacy solutions such as Wasabi and Joinmarket. Instead, you only wait for three onchain transactions, at least two of which would very likely get confirmed in the same block, for a total wait time of only twenty minutes (on average, and depending on how the user sets transaction fees).

5. To accomplish this privatizing feat, the app would first need to create a private lightning wallet. This step might sound harder than it really is; wallets like Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for Android can already set up a fresh, non-custodial lightning wallet in a matter of seconds, and since that’s an open source project the code for doing so could mostly be copied.

6. Next, the app would need to connect to a liquidity provider, i.e. some node that promises to open a channel to your node for a fee, and it would need to ask that service for an invoice to pay for liquidity of an amount equal to or higher than the amount from field one. Note that such services already exist, such as Thor from Bitrefill, and there is already a proposal (the liquidity_provider proposal) to make this a standard, trust-minimized part of the lightning spec. Also, liquidity providers can only offer a limited amount of liquidity, so the app would have to limit the amount of bitcoins you can privatize based on the most liquidity that can be bought.

7. Next, the app would need to make sure that, in opening the channel from paragraph 6, the liquidity provider and the app would need to cooperatively create an HTLC that uses the address from field two as the output in case of a channel closure. Since all HTLCs are created cooperatively anyway, this shouldn’t be a problem.

8. Next, the app would need to create a lightning invoice to receive money equivalent to the amount from field one (possibly after deducting some transaction fees).

9. Next, the app would need to calculate the following things: the cost of the onchain transaction to the address from field two, the cost of buying liquidity from paragraph 6, and the cost of the lightning fee for paying the invoice from paragraph 8.

10. Next, the app would need to prepare to open a new lightning channel to any well-connected node on the lightning network. It wouldn’t open that channel yet, because the app has not received money from the user yet, but it would need to prepare to open the channel and make sure that its capacity is equal to the amount from field one plus the amount from paragraph 9 (unless the app is going to deduct the amount from paragraph 9 from the amount in field one, in which case the total channel capacity would only need to be equal to the amount from field one).

11. Next, the app would need to present the user with the channel address, how much to fund it with, and a qr code for the user to scan with their bitcoin wallet. This information would appear when the users hits Enter on the front end, as mentioned in the front end description.

12. Next, when the user funds the channel, the app would need to wait for at least one confirmation, and then spend some of the money in the channel to pay the invoice from paragraph 6. This would create a new channel from the liquidity provider to the user’s device. Once that channel is opened, the app would need to spend the rest of the money on the device to pay the invoice from paragraph 8. Thus, a payment would come to the user’s device from the channel prepared in paragraph 6 for the amount specified in the lightning invoice from paragraph 8, equivalent to the amount in field one (possibly minus some transaction fees).

13. Next, the app would need to close its channel with the liquidity provider. Thus, the amount from field one would be sent to the address from field two (possibly minus some transaction fees). The bitcoins involved would be totally different from the ones that the user originally had; they would essentially come from the liquidity provider, while their original bitcoins are still in the user’s lightning channel and now belong to the counterparty from paragraph 10. The receiving address would be the address chosen by the user in paragraph 2 and presumably no one has ever seen that address before. And if any blockchain analysts are trying to trace these funds, they would be unable to trace the inputs to the outputs because they are part of completely separate onchain transactions. Oh yeah, and since the swap was arranged offchain, over lightning, the whole thing happens quickly and trustlessly.

14. Note that this app idea involves lightning payments, which can sometimes fail to find a successful route. If there is a payment failure, the user would need to be made aware that that money has not yet been privatized and is still on their device. They’d also need to be given a “try again” option and a “cancel” or “withdraw” option in case they don’t want to try again.

15. Also, there is at least one wait time involved in this idea because it involves three onchain transactions: one is when the user first sends money to their device via an offchain transaction, another is when the device opens a channel to the lightning network, and a third is when the liquidity provider opens a channel to the user’s device. But all of these transactions could very realistically get confirmed in two back-to-back blocks, depending on how much the user and the liquidity provider pay in onchain fees, and depending on how many confirmations the counterparty from paragraph 10 requires before they’ll route payments from the user’s channel.

16. In any case, the user would need to be told what’s going on while they’re waiting, since they’ve already paid money but it hasn’t yet been privatized. If they get impatient while they wait, they should be able to cancel the privatization. Possibly, if one or more of their payments hasn’t confirmed yet, the app could give them the option to use RBF to try to recover their money. Note that some liquidity providers are experimenting with the idea of providing liquidity instantly, without waiting for confirmations, so eventually users might not need to wait on their liquidity provider.

17. The issue of cost should also be considered. There are several costs involved in this idea. Specifically, it costs money to send money to the app, it costs money to open a lightning channel, it costs money to pay for liquidity, and it costs a very small amount to pay a lightning invoice (which happens twice in this idea).

Progress Bar

In my opinion, the app should have a progress bar that helps the user visualize how far along the process is. In addition, it could break down the progress in steps. Something like this might work nicely:

Privatization initialized
Estimated wait time for full privatization: 20 minutes
Processing user input...done...Total progress: 8.33%
Creating temporary lightning node…done...Total progress: 16.67%
Connecting to lightning network [i.e. paragraph 6 above]...done...Total progress: 25%
Preparing onchain transaction [i.e. paragraph 7 above]...done...Total progress: 33.33%
Generating invoice [i.e. paragraph 8 above]...done...Total progress: 41.67%
Calculating costs...done...Total progress: 50%

Please send [amount] to [address] [QR code here]

Note: the address above was generated by your device. You own the private keys. You can view them in Settings. After arranging to exchange your bitcoins, new bitcoins will be sent to your receiving address.

The total amount includes the following fees: - OR - The following fees will be deducted:
[amount] for onchain transaction to your address [this should probably be adjustable in Settings]
[amount] to purchase liquidity via lightning and exchange bitcoins through that channel
[Cancel button here]

Awaiting confirmation...done...Total progress: 58.33%
Paying for liquidity...done...Total progress: 66.67%
Awaiting confirmation...done...Total progress: 75%
Exchanging bitcoins...done...Total progress: 83.33%
Sending funds to your address [[i.e. broadcasting the HTLC]]...done...Total progress: 91.67%
Awaiting confirmation...done...Total progress: 100%
Congratulations, your bitcoins have been fully privatized! Your original bitcoins no longer belong to you, and different bitcoins have been sent to you from Address ABC [belonging to the liquidity provider]. No one involved in this process asked you for identifying information, so no one knows to whom your address belongs. This process was also trust-minimized; at every stage you either had private keys to the addresses containing your bitcoins or a signed transaction from someone else paying your bitcoins to you.

Conclusion

18. I think this method of privatizing bitcoins and throwing off blockchain analysts would be much faster than using Wasabi or Joinmarket. It leverages one of the most important features of the lightning network -- private transactions -- and leverages that to privatize onchain transactions. It occurs to me that this idea could also be used to create a “Private Send” feature in bitcoin wallets -- all the user would need to do is type the address they want to send privatized bitcoins to into field two and the amount they want to send in field one. What are your thoughts? Could this work?"

# I'd like to announce a new release of sPRUNED Bitcoin client.

&amp;#x200B;

spruned is a bitcoin client for lightweight systems.   
it doesn't need to store the blockchain on the disk, just the headers.  
**128mb ram &amp; 500mb hdd** should be fairly enough to keep it up &amp; running.   


Supports both Bitcoin Mainnet and Testnet.

It doesn't rely on any central authority, use both the Electrum and the P2P Bitcoin Network in real-time to gather the data you need.  


The new release (latest is v0.0.5.1) have:

&amp;#x200B;

* lot of bugfixing all around
* a robusts P2P connectionpool with a 100% getblock hitrate
* an electrum servers quorum-based fee estimation
* proxies and **tor support**
* less memory usage for low end devices
* RPC API improvements

&amp;#x200B;

The new release is cool enough to back BTC-RPC-Explorer with Tor Support:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"I'm  researching them and can't find anything to back-up their huge claims.  Including the 600M they claim to have given in coin loans, I suppose  most of those are institutions, name one, get it confirmed by the  institution itself.

On top of add I find it funny how they mention that the coins are kept in BitGo and OTHER custodial services, well which?

Can  BitGO confirm they hold crypto for Celsius and how much. They claim  they are all up for transparency, how is that not public?

In  the app when you are about to deposit they say they keep the coins in  Bitgo but ""from time to time"" they move them to exchanges and others to  short the market.

Well you have to do that more than ""from time to time"" to pay 5% interest.

"tl;dr: recommend a mobile wallet to your friends and family when you owe them some money and just pay them in cryptos. this will lead to more adoption and trust in this technology. 


Let me give you a litte idea about how everyone of us can push forward the real life usage of cryptocurrencies:

A couple of days ago, I owed a friend of mine a small amount of euros. He's into crypto and offered me to pay in cryptos. Since transaction fees are really low again, I did. After that he stated that that this was his first real use case since he got started over a year ago (every other transaction he ever had was buying, selling or storing). 

I came to the decision to offer this kind of payment to more people in the future. Most of my friends and family know that I'm into it, but the vast majority of them never came into touch with it directly. Many of them seem to be curious about it but maybe just hadn't have time or energy to get deeper into it. 

I'm thinking of small amounts in everyday life. I'm both a hodler and a user so I always have a small amount of btc in a mobile wallet while the rest of it is stored safely on a ledger.

"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been following bitcoin since the beginning of 2017 and been investing regularly since then, I did however not sell during the December high's and kept my rule to keep it to at least 2022 as I am a horrible trader.

I now have a stable job and thinking of taking a loan of 35k $ dollar to purchase bitcoin. Looking at the price right now I am feeling this is a good time to do it.. if it keeps going down lower, I will just continue investing a small amount of my salary to average out. I know the value of bitcoin in itself, and it just makes sense to become the future of money. At least for storing value once it has gained maturity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments on this or people that has done a similar thing? I know this is a risky decision, but I am young and will be able to pay back the loan no problem. I will keep my Bitcoin until 2022 and if price climbs faster then anticipated I will pay off the loan and let the rest ride. "

If US Treasury Bonds are transferred (to individuals or entities) for Bitcoin, would the government have to intervene?

"Hello everyone, how it's going?

&amp;#x200B;

Well I just arrived in Florida (I'm from Brazil) and I live in Palm Beach County (Lake Worth) and I have experience with Bitcoin since 2015. I would like to know what exchange would be better for me, for buying Bitcoin. Without bureaucracy and something else. Currently I have a CapitalOne account (and my cellphone doesn't run the damn app and I have doubts if it will work or not... it's an Android 7.0, a LG K10 from Brazil).

Which exchange would you recommend to me?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for attention!"

1. Always check that the address you paste matches the one you copied (I know, this is obvious, but still).
2. [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) has a built in QR Code generator, simply type the letters ""qr"" followed by the address you want a QR code for.

When we look at how many examples of speech are censored for POLITICAL reasons the conclusion becomes obvious.  

This is shaping up to tie in with china's social score (black mirror) so that eventually if YOUR VIEWS ARE outside what the STATE wants you will have no access to your money.

Some articles on the subject.

KYC doesn’t always target the bad guys. It prevents impoverished people who may not have access to identification from opening bank accounts, freezing them out of credit which could be life saving. It can be wielded like a cudgel by the majority over minority groups. And most crucially for our purposes, it utterly obliterates any shred of anonymity or privacy.

Privacy, both financial and personal, is a key component of life in a free society. Unlike in totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, individuals in free societies have a private sphere free of government involvement, surveillance, and control. The United States Constitution’s Bill of Rights, particularly the Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, together with structural federalism and separation of powers protections, is designed to further that end by protecting individual rights. The current financial regulatory framework is inconsistent with these principles.

**The Nasdaq stock exchange will start offering real-time information on two new indices tied to the cryptocurrency market – bitcoin core and ethereum. Both indices will be included on the exchange’s existing platform of indexes starting Feb. 25.**

## BLX and ELX Indices Capture Data From Multiple Exchanges

The Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) will “provide a real-time spot or reference rate for the price of 1 BTC and 1 ETH respectively, quoted in USD, and based on the most liquid ends of their markets,” said Nasdaq in an [online statement ](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/TraderNews.aspx?id=fpnews2019-3)published Feb. 11.

📷

According to the statement, both the “BLX and ELX work by capturing data from multiple exchanges to provide a single price point for BTC and ETH, which helps traders, get in and out of a given position.” Nasdaq claims the methodology has been verified by independent auditors.

“The BLX is one of the most widely-referenced BTC indices among crypto traders and has been calculated back to 2010. Likewise, the ELX has been calculated back to 2014,” said the exchange.

##  Driving Mainstream Crypto Adoption

The two indices were created by Brave New Coin. Nasdaq’s latest move is seen as key to introducing cryptocurrency to traditional stock market investors on Wall Street and elsewhere, thereby driving mainstream adoption. The stock exchange has swam against the tìde in being drawn to crypto assets, starting with publishing analytical reports on Bitcoin and partnering with Vaneck to launch BTC futures trading in a falling market last year.

📷

The two new indices join several dozen of Nasdaq’s indices including the Nasdaq Composite, its main index, and the Nasdaq 100, through its Global Index Data Service. The data service is a real-time feed that consolidates all Nasdaq indexes and ETF valuation data, including third-party partner data.

Nasdaq is the world’s second largest stock market by capitalization, behind only the New York Stock Exchange. More than 3,400 companies are listed on the bourse, which boasts a total market value of $10 trillion. Cryptocurrency is expected to benefit from the exchange’s expansive reach. Acceptance by institutional investors which dominate trade on Nasdaq is regarded by some as a major step towards mainstreaming virtual currencies as well as increasing adoption."

"Hello everyone, long term Bitcoin user here!

I'm quite a neutral person! I like the idea of the Lightning Network and have used it a lot before. Like most of us i've come across very positive reviews and also harsh critiques about where ways have been going.

Let's just assume, for the sake of the argument, that SegWit &amp; Lightning would not work as intended and we would need to reverse a lot of stuff or had to take another route to solve scalability in generel.

As is said; I am very supportive of the LN and as i understand SegWit; it was particularly designed to enable the LN (and indirectly made more space in the blocks without increasing actual blockzise much further).

I'm not that technical and can't understand the implications perfectly. For example there is critique about backwards compatibility.

 - What would we do if all those Bitcoins being in the LN, or stored on SegWit format addresses would need to be put back on legacy format because for some reason we needed to do that? Would they just be lost? Would we fork them to a new Format? Can SegWit/LN actually even be ""reversed""?

 - What would be an alternative scaling solution? Obviously, maybe, increasing the blocksize. But are there any other options besides blockzise and SegWit/LN? Like blocktime or something else?

 - I indirectly asked that already but: Would it actually matter if SegWit/LN fails? Couldn't we just migrate everything out slowly and test new ideas? We could, even still, just scale further by increasing the blocksize like BCH/SV already tried and still most likely be the majority chain, and just use that approach. I mean technically, SegWit/NL is not an absolute, and it doesn't need to be. This is why i don't understand the forks. All those things can be achieved on 1 chain and could/should be argued on one. I'm all for forks but i think rational thinking would still make everyone argue within the main project. Everyone could make their case. We can have LN/SegWit and still scale blocks and OP codes.

What do you think? How do you think scaling will look like a few years from now? What approach will be taken if lightning fails?

TLDR; see title."

Rick Falkvinge's new video in particular, pulled me closer to the fence.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzaEd2RQuRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzaEd2RQuRw)  
Can we have an honest discussion about his points? ^((not his character))  
Which are valid/invalid?

* **Must be Online**  
Possibly solved by a trustless contract? (lets call it 'Loop-To')  
Where a failed route to an offline merchant auto redirects funds to their:  
A) LN node when it comes online  
B) On-chain wallet  
B) is certainly possible (Loop-Out) but not ideal.  
People who are least likely to be online  
are least able to afford moving funds from L1 to L2 often

&amp;#x200B;

* **Routing = Unsolved**  
With channel liquidity constantly in flux.  
How will routing scale to hundreds of millions/billions of users?  
While preserving privacy, speed and decentralization

&amp;#x200B;

* **Nodes: Legal Liability**  
Rick claims people are now admitting this  
but couldn't name **anyone** (let alone anyone of importance)  
The worst I've heard, is Andreas saying it may carry some risk in already oppressive countries  
(China, North Korea, Venezuela, etc)  
who are less than friendly towards crypto in general

&amp;#x200B;

* **Reactive Security**  
Eltoo solves/greatly improves this IIRC?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cold Storage**  
The answer to this is always:   
*""Hot wallets for spending money, and Cold wallets for savings""*  
For individuals, ""spending money"" may mean hundreds of dollars,  
(depending on cost/time to move new money to LN)  
That's a big enough target on its own,  
but what about merchants dealing with many thousands of dollars?  
Loop-Out is a good enough solution to this, but there is still risk in the interim.  
(Unless they constantly Loop-Out, which won't be cheap)  
Are there any other proposals to improve LN security?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Not Production Ready**  
Yeah, you can't rush innovation,  
and BTC/LN are certainly doing more of that than BCH/BSV  
but is nobody else worried about the **increasing** expected time to completion?  
(Most recently Andreas A said 2 years

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Round - Concerns not mentioned in RV's video

* **Receiving Capacity**  
You have to find $1000 somewhere to receive $1000 through LN...  
(Or constantly Splice/Loop-Out, which won't be cheap)  
It feels **wrong**.  
If we get trustless LN Liquidity Providers  
to create a channel for you with $X receiving capacity, then great,  
but if not, many will wonder why this is better than VISA

The answer I got was that my limit orders on Binance took me over as limit orders can have multiple transactions with the limit order transaction. 

Is that standard with every tax preparing online service? Does every tax service end up charging limit orders as multiple transactions because of mini-transactions happening within the limit order that’s been executed?

TL;DR

Cryptonize.it

“Bitcoin is holding me accountable for the mistakes I made. By supporting BCH, I isolated the business to a group of users that were most likely to spend but very small. “
“With the split came a full stop to cryptonize.it; business relationships hurt, customers lost and rebuilding is basically at a halt. The infrastructure is there to completely mitigate volatility risc outside of BitPay’s services but it needs a total rebranding. Work I currently am unable to do.”

Lighthouse.cash

“Bitcoin held me accountable for counting on a third party and not clearly seeing the misaligned incentives, which lead to loss of investment. Lighthouse is currently not being worked on because crowdfunding how it used to be is socialist at best and also socialist at worst. The direction it needs to go needs work I am unable to currently do.”

The CashPay wallet

“Again, the mistake was made to include a third party (Bitpay) dependency in the project and have it focused on BCH instead of Bitcoin. This caused the wallet to be unstable because Bitpay doesn’t build anything for big blocks. Every stress test was another 20+ hour investment in getting it up again. It constantly felt like being part of the failure of Bitcoin instead of the success. Time and money not spent on further development; Bitcoin holding me accountable.”

"Bitcoin mining revenues **dropped in February** to its lowest level since August 2017; however, the odds are changing now with gross margins shifting back up. BTC prices also rose.

According to Diar, miner revenues declined to 19-month lows after posting its sixth decline in the last seven months. However, fees have also declined while the average BTC/USD price has remained stable in the last two months.

" Alts are calculated in satoshis

And BTC can only be calculated in USD (100.000.000Sat = 1BTC)

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have all my trades under one journal so I can see all my data (Net Gain/Loss, Avg, W/L, Avg. Max Drawdown/Favour, Max P/L, Min P/L, Avg. R\^, Expectancy etc...etc...)

It's absolutely necessary that everything is automated as well.

I have to make a choice, either I calculate it in satoshis or USD it can't be both since I need to have consistency for the calculations to work.

The only problem is that bitcoin can't be calculated in SATS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say I buy 5BTC at 3.8k$ and sell it @ 3.9K$ = Net gain of 500$ excluding comission)

And I also buy 1M TRX for 0.000005SAT and sell @ 0.000006SAT making me 1BTC)

How would one go about keeping these 2 in the same journal?

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you I do a lot of daily trades and there is no chance in hell I manually calcualte the 500$ in to sats again.

(It would also not work since in the GSS I have functions already set in place and that would mess up the stats.

&amp;#x200B;

My only solution is I have 2 spreadsheets, 1 for Bitcoin and 1 For alts.

&amp;#x200B;

Although this would mess up my stats as well......

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips or do you have any advice on better journals?"

"I'm writing a simple application that will use Electrum. I need to send &amp; receive Bitcoins, and show transaction details.

I tried **getaddresshistory** function but;

* It's slow when there's a lot of transactions.
* Can't query multiple addresses, making it slower

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way that I can provide a callback address and Electrum will send me a notification when;

* A block is found (so I can check transactions for confirmations)
* A new transaction is received

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to do it with current Electrum? Otherwise I'm thinking of modifying it, if I can.

"Hello everyone,

i'm Artanis, a little youtuber that one day wanted to break the rules.

I started to develop a little bot called Yocobot (youtube community bot) from a simple idea \* FREE AND SIMPLE \*

The bot will:

\- View videos on youtube

\- Subscribe on that video's channel

\- And more later with updates...

Every user put his link , every user watch videos of other users, simple as this :)

Then where do you win money? tryhard to get monetized youtube channels , get paid by google adsense / youtube (like me)

It will watch a video every 5mins average , humanize his moves , randomizes videos etc etc that make 288 organic views / day so 288 ads view , hudge potential for only one channel :)

&amp;#x200B;

Take it as a MINING RIG (i do) ,put the bot on a PC , start it and go sleep, it will do his job.

Here is the website: [www.yocobot.com](https://www.yocobot.com) (im sorry its only french actually) we have a discord in it

here is an explaining video (sorry for my poor english accent

&amp;#x200B;

"Not that it matters at all.

But for the public record, as much as rbtc CLAIMS to be uncensored and free speech, they simply cannot handle truth exposing the bcash Corp lies.

You see like anyone else who has spent more than a half hour browsing the cognitive dissonance, disinformation and lies on rbtc, I just happened to notice that all of the threads are dominated by 'discussion' between the same user names, who seem to have the time and energy to post 24/7. You see the names over and over again.

I was bored waiting for my ten minutes to expire to answer an obvious non truth, when I started listing the user names I saw who were spilling out the usual predictable dishonest catch phrases, on a napkin. 

I got to less than 250 user names that seem to constantly intentionally misunderstand LN, intentionally deceive posters, sway the narrative back to the same tired rbtc Corp narratives, outright lies and deception.

That's it. That's all. 250 posters in a failed project's hijacked sub.

 Now, that being said, only about 40 of them appear to work full time, so the remaining 200 odd could possibly be just those who just believe the propaganda because they are too afraid of the truth that exists outside of rbtc - those in denial.

After posting the list of the top 30, today I  was going to post the top 40, tomorrow the top 50 and so on.

I received so much gold and silver, it's stunning.

So obviously my post - within a comment by the way- was very well received, but it also got me banned.

I think like most people, rbitcoin is where we come for technical help, news, information on development etc, and rbtc is where we go for a laugh and waste some time.

Just realize now, that bcash truly is a desperate sinking ship, with a remaining 250 gullible corporate followers, and of course N Queensland.

Y'all enjoy the worthwhile content and helpful and kind community here on rbitcoin now, it's hell out there in censored rbtc.

"I have never had an issue buying bitcoin from this site, however, recently I was ripped off by a verified seller with a high positive reputation of +15000. His user is “Leven”. I am posting this to warn others to not use this guy. I actually have used him in the past successfully, however this time he straight up stole $145 from me. Also, it seems there are others with the same issue with HIM just recently. I was using a gift card and he accused me of using screenshots which I was NOT, he then told me to cancel the trade, this is AFTER I had uploaded pictures and written on the receipt at his instruction. I trusted him since I had used him in the past. However of course I was unable to use the same gift card on the site as I had already written on the receipt. Soon after I had a transaction for $145 of the $150 gift card, with no bitcoin to my wallet.  If anyone could help with what I can do it would be appreciated. 

TLDR; LEVEN stole $145 dollars from me using Paxful. Any insight or help would be appreciated.

"Hi, everyone!

Having joined in 2016, I can call myself a long time Bitcoin enthusiast. I started off with **Bitcoin Core**, and even though storing the ledger on my disk space was a bit of a hassle, overall things went perfectly fine.

That is, until the **Bitcoin Cash fork** in 2017, after which I gave up on the idea and switched to **Jaxx**. Overall, it was a significant improvement for me, as I began expanding my portfolio and diving into crypto again.

But last year **I somehow missed the BSV fork**. I thought it was too late to jump on that train, as Jaxx never supported it, and I didn’t bother looking elsewhere at the moment.

Recently I stumbled upon **Magnum**, a wallet that declares it can handle any fork claiming. So I decided to give a try but still emptied my BCH account beforehand, then imported the private key in Magnum and, **surprisingly, it worked!** I got my long awaited BSV and proceeded to claim a whole lot of other forks I didn't even know I could claim.

If you are a lazy bum like me and still haven’t done this, **it’s about time**. Just pick a wallet you trust that can do that for you, and be careful.

**P.S. If you can recommend any other wallets or services with such functionality, make sure to mention them in the comments, as I personally believe that people should know about it.**"
"In a time where disinformation and fake news run rampant, proper education for new and non-crypto users is of utmost importance. The lack of financial and corporate transparency is holding crypto back when it comes to encouraging mainstream adoption.

But i only use binance exchange to store my bitcoin and transferring from binance to the shopkeeper would be hectic and longer. is there any way i can pay him within 2 mins max walk away with my Belmont-cigarettes? before you say yeah u can do that, we have a lightning network. kindly i need a step by step guide as what wallet should i download for my android phone, how this whole thing works.

"i recently found out about this forum after reading the story that ross published. it was about his side of the story and how the owner of bitcoin talk eventually took over programming silk road. he knew too much about ross and was the one who also told on him for being the owner.

that all was not the point of the post. the main point is i tried to sign up to this forum to see what it was about and it would not let me sign up from tor. it gave a message saying if you want to sign up you need to make a payment. i made the payment and all it did was take my money. i can still not post and can not message a moderator to get my account active.

bitcointalk is a SCAM and should not be trusted."

"Hey hello there y’all. I had a little bitcoin (not much, maybe .2) left over on my silkroad (1.0) account back when it was shut down in 2013. I’d chalked it up as a loss until I recently found a piece of paper with a slew of random text on it from that time. I believe it was related to my bitcoin (can’t be sure) and wanted to know what someone does to attempt to recover lost bitcoin. I’ve read online about wallet identifiers but can’t tell if that’s what I’m looking at. Any advice?"

"Everyone knows that recurring payments can be enabled on a debit card to pay for things like a monthly phone bill. Is there an app that can do the same with a Bitcoin wallet? It would either be:

1. An app allowing a recurring payment timed to be sent from the wallet on a given date, or 

2. An application (possibly web based) on the payee's platform that is granted permission to the private key and the payment amount deducted. This may not be as trustworthy.

If something like this exists, can someone tell me? "

Btw I never participated in any gambling or transfering crypto to or from.

Used the transfer to BTC feature for all my alt coins and sold. All the best boys, got away with some profit. Maybe I'll be back on tomorrow and we'll be at 5K. No regrets though.

"Hello Reddit, We just recently put out an information piece about different trading bots and how to start using Crypto Trading Bots.

You might be wondering Why Use Trading Bots?
&gt; 
&gt; **Save time**
&gt; 
&gt; Calculating trades and executing them by hand is time-consuming and tedious work. The most difficult part is coming up with a strategy. Once you’ve done that, there’s no need to waste hours cranking repetitive work. Bots can do it for you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Efficient Execution**
&gt; 
&gt; Bots are much more efficient at placing orders than humans. You may be able to place one trade at a time by hand, but instantly be able to place fifty with a bot.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a lot of strategies that are simply not possible to do by hand. Manual calculation and execution would take too long and cause the opportunity to be missed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Consistent Strategy**
&gt; 
&gt; It’s very difficult to follow a consistent strategy by hand. Emotions often get the best of us, and we make changes to the plan on the fly.
&gt; 
&gt; Algorithmic trading takes the emotion out of trading and can consistently execute the same strategy over time.

You can find the article [Here](https://blog.hodlbot.io/ultimate-guide-on-crypto-trading-bots)

This took many hours and I hope to hear any feedback that you might have.

Hello, as the title says, I am looking for people interested in participating in a puzzle (challenge) and solving it together. The people I need for the challenge must be perseverant and understand that every success requires a failure many times, it will be a *difficult* challenge and that is why I look for a team, it must be people: honest, perseverant, wanting to have fun solving the challenge and who are willing to sacrifice as much time as possible to solve the challenge, self-confident people who do not give up. (I am looking for people who have knowledge in cryptography, computer science, mathematics, (with luck, programming in python or some scripting language, it is not absolutely necessary), enigmas, with a lot of creativity and determined to win). the challenge has a great prize if we win. For more information, tell me by dm, only for people **really interested**. Thank you! (If it is published in the bitcoin thread, it is because the challenge is related to bitcoin). P.S: I'm not the creator of the challenge, I'm just looking for people who want to participate with me."

"Why hasnt the blocksize increased to 1.5mb or 2mb? There are hours where the mempool fills up with thousands of transactions and fees start to rise. Increasing the blocksize will only shorten the congested hours and lower fees since there are a finite number of transactions per day. (currently and with more addresses being created by new users the transaction number will only increase.)

"OnionWallet (ow24et3tetp6tvmk.onion) stole about 1000$ bucks from me. Well yesterday I was in the mood to try out this new thing Bitcoins. I created a Coinbase account and wired some money over to said account. About 1000$, I thought to myself I don't really need that money right now so I can try investing it into Bitcoins and letting it sit for a while. After that I waited passionately for a good exchange value. I got lucky and got abount 0.266 BTC for my money. I still got an old OnionWallet account I used for some time ago for mixing some of my old Bitcoins. I trused OnionWallet due to the fact that they are featured on the Hidden Wiki and I tried them before and everything worked just fine. But this time was different I could thought any problems transfer the Botcoins to my OnionWallet took about an hour. After that I planned to transfer the Coins to my offline storage for save keeping. But just then when I entered my address and pincode and pressed send. The page was blank... At the firsr moment I was like okey the hell, but then on the second and third trie I shocked. Did... did I just get scamed? No it cannot be, they just have a problem with their side. I settled down and tryied again today. But today still fucking blank. I just lost 1000$ and I feel like shit. What I learned from all that NEVER TRUST SOMEONE IN THE DARKNET! NEVER! I will only use clearnet wallets from now on."

"I occasionally trade on sites like paxful. 

I was interested to start trading via international wire transfer, but what happens if the funds you receive are fraudulent? 

I get there's no reversal on transactions like that, but what action could be taken if that kind of thing were to happen? I only ask because we all know a good portion of the giftcards on paxful are illegally obtained through carding - but what about the bank related transactions that aren't legit? 

I just don't want to be in the position where a bank account is getting closed and i'm on the hook because of this. 

Would be keen to hear your thoughts! "

"In December 2018 HMRC published [this document](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals) on the tax treatment of cryptoassets.

In short, bitcoin is taxed in much the same way as stocks and shares. You're liable to Captial Gains Tax (CGT) on gains, and you can use crystallised losses to offset gains elsewhere. (In any year you can make total chargeable gains of up to £11,700 before you're liable to pay any CGT.)

If you receive bitcoin as payment for work it's taxed as income at the value it had when you received it. If you hold the bitcoin and later sell it, any appreciation in value is subject to CGT. 

I'm not a tax expert so please view the above summary as a non-expert's distillation of the essence."

"Friends, Lightning bolters, denizens of the internet, lend me your ears!  I’m proud to introduce to you Bolt-A-Thon: The world’s first virtual LightningNetwork conference and hackathon.  Winners of the hackathon will win the following prizes: 1st place = 0.3 BTC, 2nd = 0.2 BTC, 3rd = 0.1 BTC.

# Speakers

We’re also featuring fantastic workshops from people like Rusty Russell, Alex Bosworth, Pierre Rochard, Rockstar Dev, and Lightning Koala.  Even if you are not a developer, there are sessions that non-coders would gain a lot from.  For example, Pierre will be showing people how to launch their own Lightning node.  So you could try and follow along from the comfort of your own home!

# Payments

We are only receiving payments in Lightning Bitcoin.  Don't have a Lightning node?  Don't worry!  You can submarine swap on-chain Bitcoin payments into Lightning Bitcoin courtesy of Alex Bosworth.

# Prices

To register for the hack-a-thon, we require a 1000 satoshi ""proof of node"" payment.  

Each speaker session will be $10.  We will be hosting 10 speakers. This is a far cry from other conferences where you have to pay $1000 or even $399 PLUS have to pay for housing and travel. And the best part is, you can attend anonymously!

"I know I'm going to get attacked here, but it's been maddening.

Right when it came out, I was excited and started mining (slowly) before I truly understood what I was doing. My wallet was tied to some barebones desktop software, that was eventually abandoned and I was not properly prepared for it to end. Back then I wasn't using the best password wallet and it eventually stopped working, too.

Years went by and I sat on the sidelines. But now, in 2019, I figured it would be nice and user friendly to get a wallet. Safe, fast, and easy after all of these years. Instead, I was confronted by a landscape of different wallet frontends to choose from. None of them with an interface designed for humans, or instructions that made you feel an iota of confidence. And none of them one showed a clear value over the others. So I just chose safest path: the ""default"" BitCore and got started.

I dedicated an entire drive to the wallet just to be sure. It started ""building"" the database... but it took nearly an entire month to get 3/4 of the way to existence. Seemed like a ridiculous wait just to get a wallet!?! I couldn't even get familiar with the software until the database was complete. But then I ran a virus check on my (Mac) computer (which has never turned up anything) and that empty drive for the BitCoin wallet from BitCore was swimming in viruses. So I deleted it.

Honestly, how is a normal, every day user supposed to use BitCoin when you can't even get a wallet without an advanced engineering degree and a multi-month wait? I love the idea of having a BitCoin wallet. But it's been many years now and I feel like I still don't even know where to start. Is it really this hard, or have I been tricked into thinking it's difficult when there really is a simple solution? Or is obtaining a BitCoin wallet always going to be a complicated, yet delicate system that's rife with hurdles... but once you get it, you don't have to think about how hard it was to obtain anymore? Or is it this hard to intentionally shut out the normal user to keep it elite—because I thought the greater the adoption rate, the better. Okay release the hate.

**TLDR; Version:** How in hell do you even get a wallet if you're a normal human without an advanced engineering degree, or months on your hands for it to build its database? Do any of them have a user interface that makes it clear and easy?"

"Hey guys, I’m an investor and I’d like to build a small portfolio in bit coin. It’s a bit daunting once you start reading about wallets and hacking and all that. So I figured I’d ask you guys — what’s the best site to buy bitcoin and what’s the best wallet to hold it? And is there anything g I should know if I’m planning to just buy bitcoin and then just never look at it again for 10+ years?"

"Hi!  
I just downloaded the eclair (mainnet) wallet for Bitcoin on my chromebook (android app), funded it, the BTC arrived there but there is no button to send the Bitcoin anywhere.

I hope this is not a lightning only wallet, because I want to send the Bitcoin to regular non lightning adresses beginning with ""1"" and also with ""3"".

I have clicked all buttons but no option to send the BTC away is to be found.

 

Would be really glad if anyone could help me out.

 

To be more detailed: Since I was not really sure about all of this I only used 20 bucks for this as a test so if the money would get stuck I would not lose that much.

 

Thanks everyone! Have a good day!"

"Hi!  


I'm still pretty new in this whole bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general) universe, but I've done a fair amount of research I would say. One thing I can't find a ""clear"" answer to, is this; If I buy bitcoins, ***how*** traceable are they?  


I've been looking a lot into buying bitcoins anonymously, but I've come to the conclusion that it might not be worth the hassle. I'm not looking for do anything illegal, I just want to make it ""harder"" to identify me, as in for privacy purposes. So what I'm really asking is to what degree, would such a transaction be traceable back to me?

"I see a lot of posts who propose symbols for the ""Satoshi"". IMO we should just call the ""Satoshi"", the basic unit of measure, ""Bitcoin"". At the end of the day ""Bitcoin"" as intended today does not exist, it's just a lump of 100,000,000 sats. So what about just retaining the brand recognition, but slowly moving down the Bitcoin title to the lower scales. Effectively, makeling Bitcoin be the smallest unit of measure available.
If it's too drastic for the time being then at least I'd move the definition of Bitcoin to be the Millibit first then eventually keep on moving down to the Satoshi as the valuation increases."

"I've seen a disturbing lack of a usable a application for the Bitmex app in the space and even if there was there no way you can guarantee the app is not stealing your private keys so I've made an open source, simple, responsive tracker so anyone can run it on their devices personally with out having to trust third parties.

Just a heads up, Bitmex has deactivated the trade history so I've just Input a random number  to calculate your gains against which I have specified in the readme so you people can change at your will.   


Do feel free to contribute code and  help out where you can since I can only work on this intermittently so Ill be glad to get some help

"I am planning to install a solar power system for my house. It will help reduce cost in the winter for heating. But there will be a lot of excess power in the summer - I could put this excess electricity back to the grid but in my country you would not get anything back for this ( when using tax initiative for green energy installation ). 

I am trying to find some solution which will be able to do mining as soon I put energy into the device ( so it should turn on automatically if it is energy in the socket ) and safely turn off if there is no electricity in the socket. 

Could you recommend me something to achieve that? I will be happy for any tips. "

"I heard Andreas A. talk about the possibility to apply signature aggregation across the whole bitcoin block. Did I misunderstand it, is that really a possibility? If yes, it feels like it could bring huge increase in transaction capability without sacrificing any other properties. In fact it would bring even more privacy to Bitcoin than just transaction level signature aggregation. Is this correct?"

"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I think the future Payjoin solution can be a very good privacy solution for Bitcoin, but I have a question about it: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- If a user has 1 BTC and make a payjoin payment to other person of 0.1 BTC, the payee can see in a blockchain explorer the change address with an amount of 0.9 BTC. That's a serious privacy leak. I would like to know what will be the standard solution to this issue. An easy fix could be that the user wallet check if any address contains a BTC amount higher than a ""safe"" amount like 0.1 BTC or less. If some address exceed that amount the wallet could automatically make 1 payment to itself to split the amount in several addresses. In this way noone will ever know that the user has a bitcoin balance higher than the ""safe"" amount.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I only got one interesting scenario at the moment from Andreas Antonopoulos:

So, imagine a self-driving car that can give passengers rides as a taxi, and using the bitcoin it earns, buy gasoline or electricity to maintain itself, and then also buy service and maintenance. Than the owner dies and the company disappears, but the cars continue (a self-running corporation) even perhaps lease more cars with the bitcoin profits they make, without any human owners."

"In December ‘18, I noticed an unauthorized charge on my account for a couple hundred dollars in a foreign country. I cancelled the card, and my credit union reimbursed the payment to my account. Using a new debit card in January if this year, I uploaded the info to Coinbase for the purpose of buying BTC as usual, but my account was immediately compromised and used to pay for a hotel room in Spain. Since I wasn’t yet sure this was the result of using Coinbase, I again cancelled the card, disputed the transaction, and received another new card from my credit union. After attempting to verify this third card with Coinbase, my account was used to pay for gas in another US state as well as a transaction with a Russian trading exchange.

Since I stopped using Coinbase last month, my credit union account/debit card hasn’t been used for any unauthorized transactions. I wanted to post here and see if anyone else has experienced the same thing recently, and I wanted to make the public aware of this apparent risk with using Coinbase.

"The Fed is run by very scientifically minded economists who draw from 500 years of economic history to determine current economic and political conditions and command current monetary policy. The heads of each federal bank are selected politically, but with very heavy pressure from the community of the Fed banks. They elevate internally, and the folks qualified to run the Fed are always chosen from the top candidates that have elevated through its ranks. It is not questionable, that the vast majority of officials climbing the ranks in the Fed system seek minimization of unemployment, and maximization of economic growth. They seek to make us all, as a whole, wealthier. They don't operate in the realm of politics, but the top fed officials are selected through the political system. This is not ideal for any particular party or person, but it's ideal for the greater good..., if economic growth is that greater good. Their system is not to boost the stock market. If that was the case, it would be a lot higher (or would've crashed horribly) by now. It it's meant to foster genuine growth, and even it irrational market movements. They don't achieve that goal all the time, but that's what they strive for all the time. That's the Fed. Don't mistake it for anything else. "

"I was having a discussion with my friend the other day, and for the life of me, I can't understand his viewpoint.

He was saying that Bitcoin's mining energy usage is larger than some countries... I said:

""Even if that's true, why is that a bad thing?""

Friend ""Because energy still needs to come from somewhere""

Me ""I completely understand energy needs to come from somewhere. But why is it a bad thing? If anything, the energy requirements could, and probably is, directly contributing to development in renewable energy sources, since Bitcoin needs it to keep sustaining itself in the long run.""

Friend ""But renewable energy isn't anything near what we need it to be. It just isn't developed enough.""

Me ""so just because renewable energy tech isn't up to par yet, we should stop mining bitcoin?""

He then went on about how unsafe bitcoin is, but I put him I his place.


But really. Can someone help me understand this? Because if he's talking about the pollution aspect from fossil fuel sources, then that's more of the energy tech issue than Bitcoin, right?

Or does he have a point? Does Bitcoin's huge energy requirements at this point in time mean it'd be quite bad for the environment to keep going with Bitcoin?"

I am not trying to sell something, but I've found an interesting wallet, which can drop you coins from forks, which your wallet did not support

So, If you are holding your coins for quite a long time, but you did not get airdrops, here is your chance:

1. Go to [Magnum Wallet](https://app.magnumwallet.co) 
2. You can transfer your Bitcoins to the new wallet before entering private key, if you are afraid of SCAM
3. Import your Bitcoin wallet with private key
4. After entering to the dashboard click this button

" 5 months ago a user called ""pip"" published [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kq7it/introducing_the_310_btc_bitcoin_challenge/). Apparently is one of the first to adopt bitcoins and decided to make a challenge related to cryptography to give away 310 bitcoins. On October 2 the challenge began. The challenge consisted of a photograph that, using steganography and cryptography techniques, hid the necessary information to recover 4 btc wallets; 0.1btc 0.2btc 0.31btc and 310btc. Only two days later, a user had already resolved the 0.1 btc wallet, 7 days later, the 0.2 wallet was resolved and, finally, only one day after resolving the 0.2, someone resolved the 310. But ... And the 0.31? Intact to this day, pip has said several times that he is surprised that he is still there, since the 310 btc wallet was much more complex than the 0.31 wallet, but it remains intact and the solutions of the challenge will not be published until that someone can decipher the 0.31 wallet ... What do you think? Someone who can solve it? Probably the solution is related to the letters and numbers that were not used in the 0.2 wallet solution.I think the number 310 may have something to do, the prize is 310 btcs and not 300, there is another 0.31 btc or 0.310 wallet (the number 310 appears in the corner of the image). I also believe that the fact that numbers and letters are in different background colors when those in the 0.2 solution are all with white background may be related.

This is a private key. It was generated from the seed (not exactly the above seed, for accuracy sticklers). One of these is needed for each address in your wallet. It is in compressed format since ECDSA priv keys are longer. This format (or starting with L) is what you would normally see when dealing with individual private keys.

"Agreed that today BTC is volatile and you risk to loose like 20% in one day. Some claim to have stablecoins for rescue and that they will be the future . After all it makes sense. You don't want to loose even 10% but now as BTC worth 1 mln $, the manipulation and huge variations of 10% are almost impossible as we observe daily move of circa 1-2% at the best .  Hence besides all the other benefits offer BTC \[decentralised , not backed by any dollars on bank account\] BTC is also now coming with super low volatility .

"All, 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to use this as a mean of disclosing and exposing a group of scammers, their names are Paul Mahone and Samuele Maran. I recognize and acknowledge I lost money and so others did, there is nothing we can do here to get back our money but what I can try to do here is try to help others not getting tricked/scammed by these two individuals. I hope you will help me sharing the word or at least, please be aware with who you are dealing with.

Everything started back during the public token sale which was held in September and October 2017 - roughly 5 million BitBoost Tokens (BBT) were sold for bitcoin and Ether, with a value at the time of around $1.5 million usd, which in fact, they raised. The majority of the contributors were Italian (and I hope you’ll show up here following up with my post stating your opinion and experience, we need your word.). Their token had to be a utility token used by sellers to pay for listing fees on their marketplace, creating ongoing demand for the token.

Just until before the actual ICO, they have been running the project smoothly, they released the smart contract and all that stuff to make it look and sounds like a serious thing. As soon as they’ve raised the money, they stopped working for the project, they’ve basically paused it claiming to be working on the “marketing” side of things. This is just bullshit, and we all (who did the ico) know it. All the money raised during ICO were wasted for their own stuff.

Well, now it goes the end of the story and the hot point, on December 11 2018, they’ve put up a post on Medium stating “Good bye friends, we’ve ran out of cash and so forced to close the project.” This is it. I, perhaps like everyone else, was literally shocked when I read that statement, it is seriously insane and I was like - this can’t be serious.

What I am shocked about is the way they are trying to pull an exit scam and make it like it was not in fact a real scam. 

It is as obvious as saying: ”We’ve used all your money to pay for our stuff and now we ran out so we’re forced to close the project, bye bye and thanks”. 

They’ve been fine until now since I am confident that nobody as of now, has ever made a post nor exposed this whole situation, and I hope moving forward everyone who reads this and sees their face will know and remember who these guys are. I will attach a few screenshots just to make sure things don’t get deleted.

Their medium post: https://medium.com/bitboost/engineering-heavy-cash-light-good-bye-from-bitboost-33ea6dc8b1f1

Screenshot1: [http://hosting.fayp.com/u-MjEUx](http://hosting.fayp.com/u-MjEUx)

Screenshot2: [http://hosting.fayp.com/u-axcKuS](http://hosting.fayp.com/u-axcKuS)

Screenshot3: http://hosting.fayp.com/u-4nbPoT

As a side note, they’ve written, in that medium post, that they will open their GitHub so that we can track the actual development - this has never happened and as of today 11 March 2019, their GitHub is not opened. Telegram chats are also getting pruned. Clearly bullshit. 

These two individuals, Paul and Samuele managed to waste $1.5 million of USD in less than two year without even releasing the actual full product. Now, please help me understand how exactly you managed to spend $1.5 million usd in less than two years. Show us where the funds went. 

Their last words in the medium articles says “Good bye friends”. Friends? Are you serious? Do you think people can forget this whole scam? Let me tell you something Paul and Samuele, we perfectly know that there won’t be any repercussion what so ever but we also know that the crypto communities are strong together and that **we won’t forget your names and faces.

"I stumbled across this medium post that had a game from HashHub which is essentially an app that pays out small Sats for playing the game. I downloaded the app and an associated wallet Denryu and got me some sats!! When I first downloaded the mobile wallet I was asked to open a channel and stuff happened automatically in the background. This wallet did not have any BTC to open a channel. I am not sure about the mechanics but a channel was opened to a Hub/node? and I was able to transfer sats from the game that I had won to the wallet. But when I tried to then transfer some of these sats from the Denryu wallet to a wallet like BlueWallet or my tippin page it does not seem to work. It gives me an error that says 'Lightning Payment failed and refunded'. I even tried to send some sats from my BlueWallet to the Denryu wallet and the error I receive is ""API Error: payment failed. Does the receiver have enough inbound capacity?""

&amp;#x200B;

If any one from the community that has experienced this issue or has knowledge about the Denryu wallet could you please give me any info that may resolve this issue. I am not really technical but always looking for ways to be involved so experimenting with products like BlueWallet which have a really easy UI and mask all the technicality under the hood."

Could really use some help if there's even an amateur web designer out there who's in need of some quality software development.  I've been specializing in crypto-currency related software for over 6 years now, so know the protocol inside out, and can develop anything in your imagination -- exchange, LBC clone, payment gateway, gambling, coin mixer, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning to contract this work out, but I got screwed out of $15k, so looks like I'm doing it myself now.  As an added bonus, I went blind a little over two years ago, so can no longer see the screen.

&amp;#x200B;

All I really need is just finalize theme integration, and ensure everything looks 100%.  For example, take a look at:  [http://apexdemo.envrin.com/admin/](http://apexdemo.envrin.com/admin/)

&amp;#x200B;

I know that's the theme I want, but I'm also sure I created quite a few design flaws upon integrating it.  I don't know, I can't see the screen.  I know everything is there, because my screen reader tells me so, but I have no idea how it looks.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for someone to go through that, fix up the padding, margins, layout, ensure the icons are visible, tab controls and data tables look good, fonts are good, callouts, etc.  Obviously, the theme contains all elements necessary so it's not too much work.

&amp;#x200B;

Then if possible, could also use other small things, such as a quick theme overlayed on the documentation at: [http://apex.envrin.com/docs/](http://apex.envrin.com/docs/)

&amp;#x200B;

In exchange, I'll be happy to provide you with quality software development.  Again, I can do pretty much anything and everything in your imagination.  If interested, please send me a message.

"Just wanted to bring [this new paper](https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.htm) to you. 

If going to comment, please engage with the arguments. 

*Abstract*

This paper discusses the economics of how Bitcoin achieves data immutability, and thus payment finality, via costly computations, ie ""proof-of-work"". Further, it explores what the future might hold for cryptocurrencies modelled on this type of consensus algorithm. The conclusions are, first, that Bitcoin counterfeiting via ""double-spending"" attacks is inherently profitable, making payment finality based on proof-of-work extremely expensive. Second, the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of ""mining"" income via fees as users free-ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain. Instead, newly minted bitcoins, known as block rewards, have made up the bulk of mining income to date. Looking ahead, these two limitations imply that liquidity is set to fall dramatically as these block rewards are phased out. Simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a Bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality. Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help, but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation. 

Personally, I'm no longer in the Proof-of-Work world. I moved to Proof-of-Stake long ago. PoW [are getting 51% attacks more often too](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612974/once-hailed-as-unhackable-blockchains-are-now-getting-hacked/). Might implode anytime soon."

Most websites and stuff are constantly updating their security. Bitcoin doesn’t though. No one really controls it. It’s a blockchain so it checks itself and all that jazz as everyone knows. But what stops people from trying to say just start trying to hack into a wallet. Ofc encryption but how does that simply stop people? Every blockchain download holds the information of billions of dollars moved. What keep people from just hacking into that?   
   
Pardon my “just hacking.” I know it wouldn’t be easy at all but this is probably one of the most worth-it things to ever hack on the face of the planet. So what keeps the most skilled of hackers out? What kinda of top-quality encryption and security over decryption has kept so steady for years?   
   
My best guess is that they just have a secure system for entering and there are not very many openings to break in like a website would have. "

**When the 30-year-old founder of a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange died suddenly, he took the whereabouts of some C$180m ($135m; £105m) in cryptocurrency to his grave. Now, tens of thousands of Quadriga CX users are wondering if they will ever see their funds again.**

In 2014, one of the world's biggest online cryptocurrency exchanges - MtGox - **unexpectedly shut down after losing 850,000 Bitcoins** valued at the time at nearly $0.4bn (£0.3bn).

Its meltdown shook investors in the volatile emerging marketplace - but the calamity at the Tokyo-based company proved a boon for a new Canadian online cryptocurrency exchange.

""People like the fact we're located in Canada and know where their money is going,"" **Quadriga CX founder Gerald Cotten said at the time**.

Some five years later, Cotten's sudden, untimely death has left thousands of his customers scrambling for information about their own missing funds.

""We don't know whether or not we're going to get our money back,"" Tong Zou, who says he is owed C$560,000 - his life savings - told the BBC.

""There's just a lot of uncertainty.""

This month, Quadriga - which had grown to become Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange - was granted temporary bankruptcy protection in a Canadian court.

The firm said it had spent the weeks since Cotten's death trying desperately to ""locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves"".

[ Broken representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency ](https://i.redd.it/p2jf8fpn11h21.jpg)

In court documents, Quadriga says it owes up to 115,000 users an estimated C$250m - about C$70m in hard currency and between C$180m a C$190m in cryptocurrency, based on recent market rates.

It believes - though it's not certain - that the bulk of those millions in reserves was locked away by Cotten in cold storage, which is an offline safeguard against hacking and theft.

For now, all trading has been suspended on the platform.

Bernie Doyle, CEO of Refine Labs and head of the Toronto chapter of the Government Blockchain Association, calls what's happening at Quadriga a ""seismic event"" in the industry.

The world of digital currency has little regulatory oversight and a history of volatile prices, hacking threats, and minimal consumer protection.

Mr Doyle says this only adds to the nascent sector's already ""checkered history"".

But he says ""it's really unfortunate that the ecosystem takes a hit"" amid one firm's problems.

&amp;#x200B;

[Will Bitcoin Rise To $740k ?](https://i.redd.it/1o5zhu3g21h21.jpg)

## What happened at Quadriga?

Court documents filed in late January offer some insight into the company.

Quadriga had no offices, no employees and no bank accounts. It was essentially a one-man band run entirely by Cotten wherever he - and his laptop - happened to be, which was usually his home in Fall River, Nova Scotia.

It used some third-party contractors to handle some of the additional work, including payment processing.

His widow, Jennifer Robertson, says she was not involved in the company until her husband died suddenly on 9 December in India from complications related to Crohn's disease.

In an affidavit, she says she has searched the couple's home and other properties for business records related to Quadriga, to no avail. The laptop on which he conducted all the business is encrypted and she doesn't have the password or recovery key.

An investigator hired to assist in recovering any records had little success.

It was also recently revealed the company somehow inadvertently transferred Bitcoins valued at almost half-a-million dollars into cold storage in early February and now can't access them.

But Quadriga's troubles didn't start with missing coins. The company's liquidity problems began months earlier.

In January 2018, Canadian bank CIBC froze five accounts containing about C$26m linked to Quadriga's payment processor in a dispute over the real owners of the funds, an issue that ended up in court....  [Continue Reading](http://aourl.me/s/689t9v)

"I know that reusing BTC addresses to receive is not advised for privacy reasons. However I have also heard there can be a cryptographic security risk when doing this in a certain way. I heard that, if you reuse an address after sending from it, then your coins are actually more at risk of being stolen somehow because your keys are more cryptographically vulnerable. I think it might have something to do with quantum computing.

Anyway, I am ok with the privacy risk that comes with reusing an address. I have a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, and it is more convenient for me to reuse a receive address instead of having to physically get the wallet to generate a new one each time. But I am not ok with reducing the security of my holdings at all. Could someone please confirm if my understanding of the 2 situations below is correct? Am I right that Scenario A is not safe but Scenario B is perfectly safe? When I say ""private"" below what I mean is that the address has only been used once to receive.

Scenario A (not safe and not private)
1. Generate address X on Ledger Nano S
2. Receive BTC at X (safe and private)
3. Receive BTC at X (safe but not private)
4. Send BTC (still safe)
5. Receive BTC at X (not safe and not private)

Scenario B (safe but not private)
1. Generate address Y on Ledger Nano S
2. Receive BTC at Y (safe and private)
3. Receive BTC at Y (safe but not private)
4. Receive BTC at Y (safe but not private)
5. Generate address Z on Ledger Nano S
6. Receive BTC at Z (safe and private)

I'm quite new to crypto. I follow mainstream crypto news and think BTC is solid enough with more mass adoption yet to come, but I’ve never owned any coins. Our boss is a fan of the Lumi Wallet app and he suggested that we use the Lumi wallet to start and then maybe move to cold storage. I googled cold storage, it seems to be a great idea, but there's very little info about Lumi. My boss said he loves it because it looks nice, is safe enough, and supports BTC. I downloaded it and checked it out. Lumi really does look nice and seems pretty intuitive, no problems so far.

"Hi.

My full node is successfully running since a few days with approximately 20 inbound peers. As I often need to access it from outside my home, I run it on a headless Raspberry Pi that I control through SSH (usually) from an IPv4-only network. Which is why I assume this is a dual stack Raspberry Pi, capable to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

All of the required ports are also correctly redirecting traffic to its local addresses (there are two since it uses eth0 and wlan0, which means two IPv6 addresses).

What bothers me is that 100% of these inbound connections are from IPv6 nodes even though netstat tells me that the node is listening to IPv4 addresses ([0.0.0.0:8333](https://0.0.0.0:8333)). Additionally, its IPv4 address' score stays the same after a day, even if externalip is set advertise my network's IPv4 address, meaning it's unreachable to other IPv4-only nodes.

How can I tell bitcoind to use both IPv4 **AND** IPv6 instead of IPv6 only?"

**Mayer Multiples: The Metric That Helps Call Bitcoin Bubbles and Bottoms.**

[Mayer Multiples: The Metric That Helps Call Bitcoin Bubbles and Bottoms.](https://i.redd.it/iy0pdm3ye5h21.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Calling precise market tops and bottoms is next to impossible in the volatile cryptocurrency markets. That said, some traders believe identifying speculative bubbles and moments of bearish exhaustion can be made possible through the use of a fairly new metric known as the Mayer Multiple.

Created by noted investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, the Mayer Multiple is defined as “the multiple of the current bitcoin price over the 200-day moving average.”

***Mayer Multiple Formula:***

*Bitcoin market price / 200 day MA value = Mayer Multiple*

In technical analysis, it’s generally considered a bullish (or positive) indicator when prices are above the long-term moving average (MA), whereas it’s considered bearish (or negative), when the price is below the moving average. 

However, the implications are not that binary. For example, if the price is significantly higher than a long-term moving average, it’s often a sign that the underlying asset has become overvalued or what is commonly referred to as “overbought.” The opposite is the case when the price falls excessively below the moving average.

The Mayer Multiple essentially quantifies the gap between the price and 200-day MA to identify historical values at which point bitcoin enters a speculative bubble. In other words: when its price significantly exceeds its intrinsic value or points of seller exhaustion.

## Mayer Multiple: Bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://i.redd.it/ynwkdzigf5h21.png)

## Mayer Multiple: Bitcoin

 

When using Mayer Multiple, the two specific values to pay keen attention to are 1 and 2.4. The significance of a 1 multiple is simple: any value above 1 means bitcoin’s price has risen above the 200-day MA and any value below 1 means price has fallen beneath it.

By comparing multiples below 1 to its corresponding price action, it is evident that extensive bear markets take place when price finds acceptance below the 200 MA. On the other hand, bitcoin’s market favors the bulls when the Mayer Multiple is above 1 – but there’s an exception.

Any multiple above the 2.4 threshold has historically shown to signify the beginning of a speculative bubble, which is significant because all bubbles eventually burst, causing a rapid depreciation. By conducting simulations based on historical data, Mayer deduced that the best long-term results were gathered by accumulating bitcoin when the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4.

As can also be seen above, the Mayer Multiple has never fallen below 0.237, the value that marked the bottom of bitcoin’s first significant bear market in 2011.

For reference, the 2013-15 bear market reached a price bottom when the multiple showed 0.407 and the lowest multiple since then was 0.509, when bitcoin’s price fell to $3,122 on Dec. 15, according to CoinDesk pricing data.

As the data suggests, bitcoin’s price is now reaching historically oversold levels so its presumed a bottom is in sight, but is still capable of falling further away from the 200-day MA, which is currently sitting at $5,343. Further, evidence suggests that it’s highly likely the price finding acceptance above the 200-day MA, creating a Mayer Multiple above 1, would confirm the beginning of a bull market. 

## And finally

An above-1 Mayer Multiple could be considered a sign of a bull market.

A very high number represents extreme overbought conditions or bubble. BTC, therefore, could see a corrective pullback or an outright sell-off, in which case prices may eventually drop below the 200-day MA, driving the Mayer Multiple below 1.

However, that could turn out to be a bear trap, as a sharp drop from extreme overbought conditions to levels below 200-day MA is usually accompanied by short-term overbought conditions.

An unusually low number could be considered an advance indicator of bitcoin nearing a major bottom.

Now I give 5 satoshis to everyone 

for free and without any conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

I have even created the twitter account: [twitter.com/GiverOfBitcoin](https://twitter.com/GiverOfBitcoin) 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyone may instantly **start** using and learning Bitcoin without any initial investment.

So anyone can play with these 5 satoshis a lot, moving their satoshis through different LN wallets.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, Bitcoin LN payments are as fast as lightning and free!

(And scanning QR-codes and sharing satoshis with others are the purest fun.)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the whole list of LN mobile wallets, [lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)

&amp;#x200B;

For absolute newcomers there is the article on Medium: 

(how to easily to create your first Bitcoin LN invoice)

[medium.com/@GiverOfBitcoin](https://medium.com/@GiverOfBitcoin)

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed, I think, now even 1 satoshi is enough to start using Bitcoin and to learn a lot about Bitcoin.

Since even the smallest amount (1 satoshi) shows anyone what is possible with Bitcoin now and it is just amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

7 000 000 000 (people)\*1(sat) = 7 000 000 000 satoshis = 70 bitcoins

So all we need is just 70 bitcoins in total for the whole world to really accelerate mass adoption to the max.

&amp;#x200B;

There may be multiple points of giving away.

"What’s being debated is really a deflation-driven re-denomination, but there is lots of precedence for inflation-driven re-denominations: 

- New Franc (France), 
- New Peso (Mexico), 
- New Shekel (Israel), 
- New Lira (Turkey), 
- New Taiwan Dollar, 
- Brazil’s many interesting new-denominations,
- probably many more I’m unfamiliar with.

In a world where satoshis / sats are a useful pricing denomination, it would be clear from context whether denomination is “sats” (new) or “Bitcoin” (old) since there’s eight orders of magnitude difference.

During times of transition (now) there is confusion, but trying to introduce a new named “currency” (since it has a symbol) will only increase that confusion.

Also, I think it’s unclear whether the future “new Bitcoin” denomination should be sats vs bits/μBTC vs mBTC, and if either of the latter are the case, the sats denomination is all the more confusing.

Another analogy would be stock splits. When a company does a e.g. 7:1 stock split, it doesn’t get a new symbol.

My bias is that Bitcoin should be simple for new users and general public, and a new symbol for “sats) feels like a re-branding that dilutes mindshare and increases confusion. 

That’s why I think successful re-denominations and stock-splits are useful analogies. (As are the perils of re-branding consumer products, with the opposite implication.)

Think the best counter-argument is that general public has lots of experience with fractional denominations, with the Latin-derived “cent” being the most common. But even here I think there is trouble because:

1.  While the general public is aware cents, in many countries there are fractional denominations which are only used by specialists and don’t have a symbol. For example in the US the lowest denomination established by law is the “mill” which is one-tenth of a cent and one-thousandth of a USD. Aren’t sats (especially now) more like these specialist denominations?

2. In most countries, the general public does not use a symbol for “cent”, which is sometimes ¢, and instead just abbreviates the word (“25c.”) or uses a decimal in written contexts (“0.25”).

For everyone passionate about adoption and use of sats, I think it makes more sense just to use “s.” (as an analogue to cents) when working with sats (adding BTC / ₿ if unclear whether you’re talking about Bitcoin), and as Bitcoin use transitions to a new base denomination (whether it is mBTC, bits, or sats), that can be “new Bitcoin” (consensus-driven re-denomination).

"
"Starting with why:

The current business model for the internet is based on advertising.  That's broken. It will fail because it pushes companies to rape our privacy, to collect  more and more data so they can target ads better, get paid more per ad  view, per click.

They will go as far as modify our behaviors to extract as much money as possible from willing advertiser.

Finally is does pushes censorship, big brands don't want their ads  displayed next to ""controversial"" content, political opinions and other.  They want a bland and ""advertiser friendly"" internet.

The censorship will only get worse...

What can we do then?

Simple! Find a new business model for the internet!

"Hello, 

So if you haven't heard, BlockFi has opened an account offering compound interest to any BTC deposited (Link Below). Gemini is performing the custody and BlockFi is based in NYC which is positive signs since there are strict laws regarding digital assets. I've emailed their customer service in regards to their insurance policy as I couldn't find it online. Before I deposit any of my holdings I need to feel secure that BlockFi has a strong insurance policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious if anyone possibly has answers to this? I know this was just released, but has anyone opened an account? If so what are your thoughts on it? I'm very intrigued by this opportunity, but I also am not going to just hand over my BTC without doing my due diligence.

[BTCChina Global Financing Plan officially launched](https://i.redd.it/rwamlvqsuoi21.jpg)

Today, **BTCChina** officially launched global financing. This round of financing will be carried out in the form of equity financing for the global expansion of **BTCChina**, providing digital asset trading services to users around the world.

**BTCChina business progress:**

At present, BTCChina has expanded its business in Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and North America. In the future, BTCChina will focus on its BTCChina Research Institute and deepen its technical research and industry analysis in the blockchain industry, and connect the industry upstream and downstream to form a complete industrial chain.

**BTCChina History Profile:**

In June 2011, BTCChina launched the trading function. In two years, it has become a leader in digital trading platforms, accounting for 80% of the global digital currency trading volume.

In November 2013, BTCChina received an A round of investment, which was funded by Lightspeed and China Venture Capital and US Lightspeed Venture Capital, with a total financing of US$5 million.

In September 2017, BTCChina complied with China's policy and suspended the RMB trading business of the platform. In order to guarantee the rights and interests of BTCChina users, a clearing team was set up to handle the retreat, until today.

In January 2018, BTCC's mobi wallet, mining pool, overseas trading platform and other businesses (excluding BTCChina) were acquired by the Hong Kong blockchain investment fund.

In January 2019, Yang Linke personally announced the acquisition of a 100% stake in BTCChina, and BTCChina returned to the blockchain stage."

"Crypto has always had a problem: that a lot of the people involved in it aren’t marketers, designers, or familiar with branding or end-users. 

They’re mostly highly technical individuals who are in a “big bang theory“ demographic.  

As such we’re getting Satoshi symbols from comic book themes and pop culture scribbles from backs of people’s notebooks in 1986.  

I get it. It’s funny. 

It’s fun. 

But I’m worried that everyone’s here is going to rally behind a symbol that is not contemporary, matching with the existing bitcoin branding style, and will get a ton of votes - - even though outside of this little bubble, nobody would say it’s a good option."

6. Use new phone to communicate via QR codes with old phone to sign transactions with bither wallet

Only flaw I see is the need to keep the phone safe from theft if software security fails. Old phone could be erased and or destroyed with the wallet being created only when it's needed. Or just keep the phone in a safe. Is there an easier to use app that allows using your own entropy and can use qr codes to sign transactions?"

This is the second initiative from Facebook after they tried to introduce Facebook points during 2012 and was not successful. This time it may translate into a success due to the following reasons

1) Feasibility of massive adoption: Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram active user base. WhatsApp alone has more than 1 billion daily active users and crypto transfer can be a click of button and trust is pre-established. Telegram biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao, and Line

2) Similar successful products in the market: Venmo has taken off in the United States by making it easier to send payments by phone. And in China, many consumers use the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular WeChat messaging system.

3) Ease of opening a Facebook account compared to a bank account. Regulation and compliance is the next big puzzle to solve for Facebook.  
4) Unlike JPM Coin backed by USD alone, Facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars, euros and other national currencies held in Facebook bank accounts.

The big question facing Facebook is how much control it would retain over the digital coin. If Facebook is responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user, it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system, rather than a traditional, centralized system like PayPal. Let us follow another interesting development."

At a time when we are all clamouring for more adoption of cryptocurrencies comes an exchange that will massively drive mainstream adoption of these virtual currencies. One of the bottlenecks to achieving this is the inability of people to buy cryptocurrencies with their fiat and there is quite a few exchanges that does this.

"There are a huge people that look at Bitcoin prices and expect to go as much as can go lower.

Me included, i look at a fair price to buy Bitcoin, everyone ignore vast majority of new investors.

It is not my fault that you bought at 20k by looking at influencers or public figures ( like  McAfee ) said at hype prices 20k.

If i have a chance to buy 10x more bitcoins then you with same amount of fiat, i'll take it.

I am pretty sure there are much more people that wait for fair prices then are people that bought at top.

Why everyone ignores us? So, yes, i do expect to buy bitcoin under 1k. 

I have sold some parts of btc at 18k, because you could see from moon how big the hype was.

I did not made the game, but i play it very wisely and responsable. 

I am sure that you gonna be on fire after reading this, but hey! Don't blame people that look to buy at fair prices. 

I also see everyone spreading and trying to find reasons how btc can go at 20k. Reality can hurt you more in the future.

The question is : ""HOW MANY READERS WANT TO BUY UNDER 1K $ PRICE?"" "

"COINBASE ALTERNATIVES: **Bisq, Localbitcoins, HodlHodl, Kraken, Walltime, Cash App, Flyp**


I believe these exchanges have a better record when it comes to supporting bitcoin. Many of them aren't perfect, but definitely better than coinbase.


Bitstamp has had a great reputation, but it was recently bought out, so I'm not too sure about it now.  Lot's of people like to reference Gemini and Coinbase Pro (wtf?) as a Coinbase alternative, but I not sure why they feel that way.  Gemini is all about regulation and they do not even utilize segwit yet.


Anyone care to comment on bitstamp, bitfinex, hitbtc, coinsbank, and liberalcoins?"

The money has not been taken out of my bank account yet but I do not want to risk losing the money I deposited to Coinbase.

Should I go to my bank and ask them to freeze my account/deny authorization or should I just wait the 19 days and then transfer the money back into my account.

PSA: BTC ATM insurance is necessary

To all the folks out there looking to
enter the Bitcoin ATM market, do yourselves a favor and purchase insurance. My buddy and I recently purchased a GeneralBytes ATM, and our dream of one day operating hundreds of Bitcoin ATMs has been crushed due to an act of vandalism and attempted theft. 

The good news? We withdrew all the cash the night before so no funds were stolen.

The bad news? Our machine is destroyed and we haven't made enough money to purchase another. 

So here's a public service announcement to all the other BTC ATM operators our there: BUY INSURANCE! It's worth it. We thought we were ""saving money"" by neglecting to purchase insurance but our failure to do so has cost us everything. 

Don't be like us. Buy insurance for your BTC ATM!

With no real factual evidence but just some points of interest that are leading me to believe that we will soon hear that either Gemini or Coinbase has had a recent security breach. Take it as you will to DYOR.


"1. How secure is Electrum for cold storage? How do I use it for this purpose? After I download Electrum and generate a wallet, do I need to keep that computer offline from that point on?

2. Is 12 seed words secure enough?

3. Do I have to encrypt my wallet for it to be secure?"



"So many people are trying to call ""the bottom"" so they can claim oracle status in the near future. Will BTC Double-Bottom? Will it fall to $3000? $2500? $1k? Obscure numbers like $999 have even been tossed out there... and of course, my favorite prediction: $0.00 USD.

Well, the truth is, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things... as long as the fundamentals of BTC remain strong today and in the future.

By strong, I mean the network must remain **secure** and continue to resist hostile takeovers from a plethora of bad actors and world governments alike. Such attacks can be computer software-coded, or physically introduced with the enactment of draconian laws, or consist of emotional manipulation (i.e., spread of fear / misinformation) via government &amp; bank-controlled media outlets. The possibilities here are endless.

Despite all of this, the people who remain in the market today -- beyond the media's short-lived obsession with BTC back in 2017 -- should not simply be labeled ""strong hands."" Everyone here is susceptible to moments of capitulation... but at the end of the day, the majority of people following BTC in the year 2019 know exactly where this technology has been, and realize where this technology is headed.

If you believe BTC will have a value of $0, then you have arrived extremely late to the party and should indeed remain on the sidelines indefinitely... but for those of us who spend our days &amp; nights learning as much as we can about BTC's history, Blockchain technology, Hard/Soft Forks, and just technology in general, there is literally **no USD price** that would cause us to abandon this project.

(Well, I used the term project... but at this stage, I'm tempted to call it a *revolution*.)

"Found this article via twitter: https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology/

tl:dr: Do you need a public blockchain? Most certainly no. Cryptocurrencies are useless.

Quotes from the article with my thoughts:

&gt;Most blockchain enthusiasts have a unnaturally narrow definition of trust. They’re fond of catchphrases like “in code we trust,” “in math we trust,” and “in crypto we trust.” This is trust as verification. But verification isn’t the same as trust.

Agreed. It is better than trust.

&gt;What blockchain does is shift some of the trust in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they’re often single points of failure.

Agreed, tho the distinction of elimination of trust and shifting of trust appears to be a problem of semantics. Nobody in his right mind claims that blockchain _eliminates all trust_ ... instead it shifts the trust from (arguably) corruptible systems of human beings in power and institutions to the verifiable trust in code. Tho:

&gt;When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange gets hacked, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet gets hacked, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there’s a bug in the code of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully hacks the blockchain security, you lose all of your money. 

All true.

&gt;Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don’t have the expertise to audit?

Whatcha think? How about your expertise to audit the human legal system?  How about getting the expertise to audit the ""some computer code"", at least the basics? The ressources are out there, if you want to.

&gt;Blockchain enthusiasts point to more traditional forms of trust—bank processing fees, for example—as expensive. But blockchain trust is also costly; the cost is just hidden. For bitcoin, that's the cost of the additional bitcoin mined, the transaction fees, and the enormous environmental waste.

Transaction fees fluctuate yet appear to be very low atm (https://bitcoinfees.info/). Enviromental waste is a factor yet definite numbers and impact are highly debated.

&gt;Bitcoin might theoretically be based on distributed trust, but in practice, that’s just not true. Just about everyone using bitcoin has to trust one of the few available wallets and use one of the few available exchanges. 

Sounds more like 2013 than 2019 and - as with every emerging technology - this will get better and more diversified all the time as long as the technology keeps developing. 

&gt;And we've seen attacks against wallets and exchanges. We’ve seen Trojans and phishing and password guessing. Criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin.

We've seen this with conventional banking too.

&gt;Honestly, cryptocurrencies are useless. They're only used by speculators looking for quick riches, people who don't like government-backed currencies, and criminals who want a black-market way to exchange money.

Cliche/FUD/speak for yourself.

&gt;To answer the question of whether the blockchain is needed, ask yourself: Does the blockchain change the system of trust in any meaningful way, or just shift it around?

It changes the system of trust to a distributed system of verification which is very meaningful.

&gt;Does it just try to replace trust with verification?

It shifts from trust in (financial) institutions to trust in veryfiable code.

&gt;Does it strengthen existing trust relationships, or try to go against them? 

It eliminates and/or upgrades existing trust relationships which is a good thing.

&gt;How can trust be abused in the new system, and is this better or worse than the potential abuses in the old system?

Actually a valid question. Whatcha think?

&gt;And lastly: What would your system look like if you didn’t use blockchain at all?

"Hi /Bitcoin!

Since I have not seen any posts about this I will drop the question here.

The EU is going to implement a new law which will give the people ownership of their own banking data. Things like transactions, account number and location data. Way to go you would say right? Wrong! 

Right now many people use wifi, websites, services and just click the “I accept” buttons . Now what will happen if they will put these terms to the task of letting (amazon,facebook etc.) having acces to your data. 

They could use this like cookies and set a price which will be tuned as you use your transactions or by the amount of money you have stored. I might not have written this fully out but I think you will know what I mean with the above.

Will this mean crypto will be more important than ever before? Is this the way around the system? Or just a privacy service?

What are your thoughts?

"This isn’t a faucet.
This isn’t a shady miner website.
This isn’t gambling.
If you are tired of dicking around on faucets all day, here is what you do, get gift cards and trade them on paxful/local bitcoins.
How do you get the gift cards for free then?
Rewards websites &amp; apps, there are a lot of great apps that offer this.
Some let you scan receipts for points convertible to money like receipt hog, receipt pal, fetch rewards and others.
Some give you points for shopping for specific things like ibotta.
Some give you money for surveys like swagbucks.
There are plenty of legit websites that give you gift cards for tasks.
Now it may take some effort to accumulate points, but in the time you got $5 or $3 to trade, you are still at satoshi numbers on faucets, yikes.
Now yes, LBC and Paxful will take fees for your transactions, but I think doing it this way is the best way to get your first dollars in BTC free.
A much more profitable way to get bitcoin for “free”, is by making your business support bitcoin, but you still have to pay for your business, so this is not “free” per se.
Although this is not a way to get a lot of BTC for free, I think it is better than investing time (and sometimes money) on faucets and scams.

"The commissioners are about to force cryptocurrency/Blockhain data operations to invest in and only use renewable energy. They are claiming there is an imminent emergency/threat because of the carbon footprint of these facilities to the environment. What's funny is that there is only one large scale operation in town, Hyperblock, who has always used hydroelectric power for it's facility. This zoning could take place as early as April 4th. This same group of commissioners just passed a resolution giving the county until the year 2035 to achieve carbon neutrality. They have already posted publicly that in 2017 they found that 27% of the county's CO2 came from it's fleet of vehicles, while 19% came from community employees. They give themselves 16 years to be at 100% renewable energy yet the cryptocurrency operation that is already using renewable energy is under attack?

"I was in a hurry and never seen an electrum login message before (I think it should not be a thing) so I downloaded the malicious 4.0.0 wallet (from electrumstart.org, don't go there).

It asked for my 2FA and then I knew it was a scam immediately, so didn't give it, removed the wallet and did a malware scan (know that's far from being trusted to find everything) and did a search for all files that were last accesed/created in the last 20 minutes and I can't see any new files or weird modifications so I'm guessing that it didn't have a permanent virus inside and that it was ""just"" a malicious standalone client.

Was it? Also, does it target other coin wallets?"

"Hi,

I am trying to calculate my short-term capital gain tax for cryptos and would appreciate if you guys could let me know if I am doing it correctly.

I put two times some money into crypto in 2018 and then had several tradings in 2018 with loss and profit. I have traded all of my crypto stack and then finally switched to USDT at the end of the 2018, but did not cash out to USD and they are in crypto yet. So as the crypto to crypto is a taxable event, I am wondering do I calculate this tax correct.

I subtract the total USD value of my cryptos in the last trade in 2018 (let's say 31 Dec. 2018) from cost basis (two times deposits which I had in 2018) and this will be my short-term capital gain and should pay tax for this amount according to my tax bracket. No need to go through the details of each trade one by one and just the difference of initial deposit and final value in the last trade in USD is relevant for tax purpose.

Am I am correct or missing something here? If this is correct, wonder why one needs to go through all different webpage for crypto taxes and huge calculations and not use this approach to report their taxes?

Thanks."

I am also planning on including this in the next article. I just wanted some feedback. Any constructive criticism is welcome!!! 

Did the feds create Bitcoin? Is Satoshi Nakamoto just a clever attempt to cover their tracks? 

Good morning it is Tim again. I have been writing an article that is attempting to shine some light on the infamous Satoshi Nakamoto. I have heard of so many candidates that its very difficult to narrow it down to a few people. One of the scenarios that the feds created Bitcoin to end fiat and implement a currency that could be traced 100% of the time. I personally do not think the government created Bitcoin, but that won’t stop me from having a bit of fun and writing about it. When I hear the argument about the government being Satoshi it makes me cringe. I have always believed Bitcoin was the people’s money. Government issued fiat is not controlled by the people. This is just one of the reasons I disagree with the idea that the US government is Satoshi. Let’s look at some of the reasons people believe the government was or wasn’t involved. 

What if the government did create Bitcoin? 

Okay I made it clear earlier, I do not believe the government was involved in the creation of Bitcoin. But what if they were the ones responsible? Let’s discuss the reasoning and logic people use when they accuse the govt of deceiving us. Why would they want to create a currency like Bitcoin? Well first and foremost, Bitcoin is traceable. In this day and age, if you don’t understand that the govt despises privacy, you are lying to yourself. Supporters of the theory that the govt was involved always use this as an argument. The farther we move into the digital age, the more important creations like Bitcoin will become. Which leads people into believing the govt was possibly scared of being left out of the cryptocurrency revolution? But let’s look at the flaws in this logic. Why would the govt create a limited currency like BTC? Why wouldn’t they, instead, create a coin similar to Dogecoin? I mean the govt loves to print money at will. That’s why we left the gold standard in the first place. (The govt spending was kept in check when the gold standard was in place, since it was abolished, we have spiraled into massive debt) To me it’s not likely the govt would limit their ability to create money at will. Even Dogecoin is mined and only certain amounts are released after each block is mined. Which means the govt would technically still not be able to print the currency at will (instead they would need to mine it) In my opinion the govt would never ever give up their ability to print infinite money. It just isn’t likely. How often has the government given up their power and given it back to us? I can’t think of a single time. 

What would a govt issued cryptocurrency look like?

Okay we have discussed the reasoning behind the idea of the govt being involved in the creation of BTC. It may or may not be true. But let’s focus on what a United States federal issued cryptocurrency would look like (in my opinion). If the US govt decided to create a cryptocurrency I believe it would be very similar to the USD now minus the privacy one has when using paper bills. Let’s face the facts, paper currency is probably the most private currency in the world right now (even more so than Monero) due to the fact that paper currency is not easy to trace. There is no public ledger like BTC has. This is one big reason people assume the govt was involved in the creation of BTC. I can see the logic in this thought process, but why do I disagree? Because the govt wouldn’t ever limit their ability to create currency at will. Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins. That’s all that will ever be mined. There have already been nearly 4 million BTC lost over the last 10 years. That leaves us with approximately 17 million coins. Bitcoin will ultimately be deflationary. The govt doesn’t like that idea either. Its apparent that economists these days believe inflation is a good thing due to the fact it discourages hoarding and encourages spending. I can see where these economists are coming from, but I respectfully disagree. Deflation is a good thing for the people. Who wants to save when the money you are saving is only going to decrease in value over time? The govt is not trustworthy, but if you look hard enough you can see the way things work. Henry Ford said it beautifully, “It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” I agree with him. Your average citizen simply does not understand basic economics. The US uses this to its advantage and that is why we are currently 21 trillion dollars in debt. 

I am straying a bit so let’s get back to the issue at hand, what would a US govt created cryptocurrency look like? Well I believe that it would be inflationary (mainly due to the fact the govt refuses to limit its abilities to create currency at will). We should not expect the govt to limit their authority. The cryptocurrency would likely not be mined due to the fact mining requires time and energy which would ultimately reduce the power to create currency. It would be unlimited (inflationary). Like Dogecoin (No cap on creation of coins like BTC with its 21 million) The difference is Doge is limited to the amount people can mine. Nobody can just say print 10 billion dogecoin and make it happen. It requires mining to acquire newly minted Dogecoin. The US govt would create a totally centralized coin. One that could easily support reversed transactions. One that would resemble the US dollar in many ways. The main difference between a potential govt created fiat and cryptocurrency is the fact that with paper money out of the way the govt can now trace any and every transaction. This is music to the govt’s ears. The coin would probably resemble the Petro in Venezuela. You need to acquire it from certain places and KYC is a must. Not to mention the US govt could possibly force us to pay taxes and other things in their cryptocurrency (Venezuela is already attempting to force the petro on its citizens) There would likely be no consensus mechanism (proof of work, proof of stake) The govt would simply issue more when they wanted. I wouldn’t compare that to cryptocurrency, but rather gaming credits or digital fiat. Unlimited and the currency could be created whenever they felt like it. 

One more point to bring up is why would the US govt create a cryptocurrency that can be mined in China? There is a lot of Bitcoin being mined in China. This just seems asinine to me. Why would the US govt create a crypto and sit back and watch China take it over? (Im not saying China runs BTC, I am saying that if the govt created BTC, they would have mining farms the size of football stadiums) China has been accused of controlling nearly 80% of BTC mining (at least at one point it did) See the following link to explore where I got this information.  [https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/pools/) . Mining pools are a collective of people that put their hash power together to get better rewards for mining. China is anti-crypto when compared to a lot of countries. The Chinese govt does not appreciate Bitcoin at all. They regularly release a list of their favorite cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin is rarely even in the top 5. The reason for that is China likes to control citizens just like the US govt. Even with this in mind the Chinese govt encourages Bitcoin mining. Mainly due to the revenue the govt collects from these mining farms. If the US govt created a cryptocurrency, they would almost certainly attempt to avoid this situation where China controls the majority of mining. 

To be perfectly honest the only reason I could see the US govt creating Bitcoin would be traceability and elimination of privacy when buying and selling (especially on the internet). I can’t see the US govt being the entity behind the creation of Bitcoin. People point out that SHA-256 (Btc uses this cryptographic hash algorithm) was created by the NSA. But that doesn’t prove anything at all. All it proves is SHA-256 is very secure and that is the reason Satoshi ultimately went with it. Another thing is these computer scientists and Bitcoin advocates that I know aren’t ignorant. People from Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey (I don’t know these guys) to people I do know like Ash Roulston, Dee Tee etc all have high opinions of BTC and brilliant minds to accompany their opinions. These are smart people… Much smarter than me. None of these people believe that the govt created Bitcoin and neither do I. I hope you enjoyed the write up.

"Hoy,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to upgrade my raspiblitz lightning node from .93 to 1.0.  I run into a couple of issues.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've been trying to close my channels to sweep my funds out of the onchain wallet, but the node seems to be running autopilot. I never saw the node auto open any channels before, perhaps because I was manually making channels, but now I can't get it to stop recommitting funds as soon as they hit the onchain wallet. I can't figure out how to make it stop auto opening channels. Any advice on this?
2. I have the seed for the onchain wallet. If I just go ahead and flash the drive and then create the lightning wallet from the seed, will this even matter? I should still have access to the funds if I don't sweep them.
3. I have a second micro-SD that I can use, and I'm thinking of starting the 1.0 node on the second one and leaving the .93 as a backup in case I can't recover my funds. However, part of the instructions for upgrading include running a command to clean the HDD,  /home/admin/XXcleanHDD.sh . Will this make the drive unusable for the .93 version if I try to revert? Can I run this command while the node is running?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all my questions for now. Thanks in advance for any help!!"
"CBOE was the first U.S exchange to launch Bitcoin futures trading. Some crypto enthusiasts speculate that futures contracts were a catalyst for the price drop that rekt us over the past year and a half, as correlations were drawn between significant price drops and contract expiration dates early on. 

&amp;#x200B;

CBOE is now throwing in the towel, mainly because CME (the other futures trading exchange) is now dominating a huge chunk of current futures action. The firm stated that once the current contracts expire this June, they will pull the plug.

&amp;#x200B;

Although futures will still be in full swing at CME, some say losing 1 of the 2 institutions that offers these contracts shows that big firms aka ""institutional investors"" are no longer excited about digital currencies. That big money was a supposedly a major factor in main street adoption and market cap increase for cryptocurrency overall. Does this even matter? Thoughts welcome.

"&amp;#x200B;

Whether you are new to crypto or have experience filing your crypto taxes, here are 5 very important things to note for your 2018 tax filings. 

## 1. Cryptocurrencies are capital assets and profits are recognized as capital gains

For each taxable crypto event, a calculation must be made to determine whether you have a capital gain or loss to recognize. These gains/losses are reported on your tax forms.

These taxable events include:

* Selling crypto for fiat currency (i.e. USD) 
* Trading BTC for ALTs or ALTs for BTC
* Using crypto to buy goods or services
* Receiving crypto due to a fork or as a result of mining

## 2. Losses can be used to offset gains and to reduce taxes

If your crypto activity results in a net loss for the tax year, you can use that loss to deduct up to $3,000 against your taxable income. If you have losses in excess of the $3,000 that can be deducted against your taxable income, the excess losses will be carried forward to the next year.

The losses that have been built up can be used to reduce capital gains in the subsequent year. In addition, the losses can also be used to reduce another $3,000 against the following years taxable income. This will continue in perpetuity until the losses are all used up.

**A Simplified Example:**

2018: $10,000 in capital losses. $3,000 are used to reduce taxable income. Thus, there is a $7,000 capital loss carryover.

2019: $2,000 capital gain. The $7,000 capital loss carryover will be used to wipe out the $2,000 capital gain. In addition, of the left over $5,000 in losses $3,000 will be used to reduce taxable income. There is now $2,000 left in capital losses to carry forward to 2020.

## 3. Keep accurate records!

As we have seen over the past couple of weeks, exchanges go offline and users have no way to access their records. All taxpayers should constantly download their data as frequently as possible to make sure that they have adequate records. 

* Keep records of all your cryptocurrency activity, not just trading activity occurring on exchanges.
* Periodically download your trading history from any exchanges you use.
* Ensure you have a record keeping procedure to document all of your crypto spends.

## 4. Transfers from wallet to wallet and gifts do not create a taxable event

When crypto is transferred between wallets or exchange accounts that are owned by the taxpayer, a taxable event has not occurred. However, mining or withdrawal fees can be used as an addition to the asset’s basis or a deduction from the proceeds that are eventually realized. 

A gift does not create a taxable event for the recipient. However, gifted crypto that is subsequently sold will create a taxable event. When you are gifted crypto, you receive a carry-over basis from the person who gifted you the asset. This means when someone gifts you crypto get their cost basis information from them! Additionally, the recipient of the gift receives the donor’s holding period in the property for determining whether a gain is classified as long term or short term.

**Example:**

You are gifted 1 BTC in October 2018 from your friend who purchased the BTC for $2,000 in May 2017. 

Your basis in the asset will be $2,000 and it will have a long term holding period. 

## 5. 1099-Ks don’t necessarily reflect you crypto income for the year

If you receive a 1099-K for your crypto activity do not panic! Exchanges are required to send you a 1099-K if your activity exceeds $20,000 or you have over 200 transactions.

The amount that is reported on your 1099-K will not necessarily indicate the amount of gains or losses that need to be reported to the IRS on your tax returns.

I have a free charting webservice I created for the CFTC Commitment of Traders report.  It tracks all the commodities from the CFTC report which is released every Friday.   You can access it at [https://bitcoin.cftc-data.com](https://bitcoin.cftc-data.com) 

&amp;#x200B;

From the chart you can assess where the **net positions** are for the various participants - 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Dealer** \- These are short side of the market selling futures to offset risk of their investment products.  Typically swaps, etf's, etc fall in this bucket.
2. **Leveraged Funds -** Essentially these are hedge funds, CTA's, proprietary trading firms.
3. **Asset Manager** \- Institutional investors - Pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies.
4. **Other Reportables** \- ""Everyone else"" that does not fit into the above categories.  Typically this is independent traders.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also see the open interest of the contracts over time. Note that the CBOE contract has been losing open interest while the CME contract has been gaining this entire time.   

&amp;#x200B;

Any questions - feel free to respond or message me.  Thx"

"A friend is trying to buy Bitcoin but having issues finding an exchange that will work.

Limited factors so far are 
NYS resident
Foreign Japanese bank account 

Are their any exchange that allow residency in NYS but also allow FIAT with yen?

Liquid doesn't support NY but does support yen ( will be using once Bitcoin is aquired)
Kraken supports yen but doesn't support NY or Japan but does support yen.

Brittrex supports NY and US FIAT but not Japanese (my favored) .25% fee but is a little harder to get to deposit USD

Coinbase is expensive in service fees right now your looking at $60/Bitcoin 1.49% transaction fees idk if it supports yen at all or foreign banks.

Any help or suggestions would be very helpful!

"Hello everyone,

We made a roullete game very similar to the CSGO roulettes. It has a trollbox so everyone can chill and get to know each other with a tipping bot. So even if you're new to Lightning and don't have a few sats yet, ask around! We also have a feature where you can pick your strategy and it will play automatically for you. That way you don't need to be constantly clicking or even around your device!

There's been a few people hitting some greens already and it's always fun in the trollbox when that happens.

"In late 2014, years before the recent brouhaha over Coinbase's latest debacle in re. their decision to utilize someone from HT and all the negative implications of that - I stopped using CoinBase and Bitpay.

(( Old 2014 discussion on this which drew a lot of attention at the time at: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2kmpmr/open_letter_to_bitcoin_businesses_why_im_closing/ ))

The main reason for me leaving? Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitstamp and a ton of other companies at the time in 2014 openly and explicitly announced their support for the Windhover group's 'Proportionate Enforcement and Risk Based Regulation,' which contained a terrible pill suggesting that all identity - even future identities based solely on bitcoin blockchain, or similar technologies - should be deemed under sole purview and control of governments.

Your identity, of course is regulated and monitored. Any country's passport or state DL is a classic example. But the state no longer has sovereign control and monopoly over money. Why should it for identity either?

This is to speak out against exchanges or brokerages that don't respect our agency and ability to create our own identity. This is a ramble on why we shouldn't use Coinbase, Bitpay, Stamp, or other exchanges that fundamentally have acted against people's best interest, not once or twice but persistently over years.

So what transpired then?

I closed my accounts with Coinbase. and Bitpay in late 2014. It took a long time but it worked. Yes, they retain business records that you had an account and details of that for years after - Business records laws. But you should close the accounts.

I explored the decentralized trading and markets world a bit. I was impressed with O.b. and what eventually became Bisq though then it was still very much under early development in those years - what is now bisq didn't see heavy development until 2017 though technically it was under development in 2014-2015 under the bitsquare name.

I eventually (cautiously) commended and recommended a handful of centralized exchanges (you can count them on fingers of one hand though, in terms of the actual good ones that haven't fallen prey to Coinbase-level evil) that had done well in staying secure and defending the users (their client base). These were and are exchanges that decided not to go the route Coinbase &amp; BitPay took in 2014. You know who they are if you have been here awhile. Check out Kraken, TheRock Trading, and more recently HodlHodl. These are good. There may be some others but very few centralized exchanges are seriously devoted to protecting the users as part of a business model in reality. Can they do better, sure. Are they doing their best to help and protect clients, including against repressive systems? Yes.

I spent a lot of time after 2014 assessing how modern licensing regimes affect people and then, I threw myself at helping defeat bitlicense in California. CA bitlicense proposed as AB 1326 in 2015? Defeated, with help of EFF, Bitcoin Foundation, Plug and Play tech center, John Light, Bruce Fenton and thousands of others in California. But it came back twice again; its later proposed zombie form was AB 1123 (2017-2018) which we also defeated. We realized the author, Dababneh was going to bring it back again and again even though we defeated bitlicense proposals in California each time they were re-introduced. What to do? Suffice it to say Dababneh is no longer in office, he can no longer legislate, but keep an eye on his replacement. The price of maintaining a market free of such garbage (or largely free of it) is vigilance. Bitlicense was defeated in various other states, too. It currently only exists, in the USA, in NY, which caused the best exchanges to decide to leave New York. You know who they are. The ones operating in NY have caved to it - don't support them, do bisiness elsewhere. Help permissionless innovation take root around the world - vote with your wallet.

Somehow this all eventually got me on a path to actually getting work in crypto. I then went from a mostly unemployed bitcoin advocate to working full time in crypto for an organization that I can safely say has some of the very best people in the industry. It is nonstop work and is a real blast. It is not just ""the future,"" it is now. If you like working hard and helping improve people's lives crypto is for you. And yes, more and more philanthropic organizations and nonprofits are now accepting and working with bitcoin. That is a growing part of the future of this endeavor."

"My renter always pays via Western Union money order. Recently I went through an old pile of papers and I found an unopened rent envelope from 2017. I tried to deposit it and the bank said it was too old. I went to Western Union and they said it was cashable but I had to go to the exact place it was created. I went there and they said it was too old for them to cash, to call the number on the back. The  number on the back had no possible way to reach a person. I went online and found a different number, got a person who sent me to another person who then hung up on me when I said their speaker was muffled. I called back and finally got a person who said that my $750 mo was now depreciated to $727 and I would have to apply for a refund using the form on their website. That form has to be notarized (luckily I can get that for free from my husband), and I have to submit a $15 service fee. It will take at least 30 days to receive my refund. This on a money order that already cost $3 at purchase, and ""depreciated"" $27, and with an additional $15 to get it back. Anybody who thought money orders were like cash are so very wrong. I don't know why anyone uses them. There are definitely hassles to getting bitcoin set up for a first time user, but after that it is so easy and cheap and I own it.

This is not because of the design of it, but because everyone chooses to do all their ""private"" communication through facebook messenger, gmail, or some other pretend ""free"" service.

The future where bitcoin use is ubiquitous, but nearly everyone you know uses (and moreover expects you to use) companies like Coinbase who's product will switch from selling exchange services to surveillance is a 100% disaster.

They will build regulatory moats the likes of which don't even exist in email making the problem FAR worse and they will allow people to deposit, withdraw and trade for less than anyone else, or even free because that will no longer be how they make their money.

Their profit will come almost entirely from data selling, or advertising (which of course will be targeted, based on your data, given away disrespectfully).

"Bitcoin Holding $3,550 Means “Next Strong Move” is Building! 

Original Source: [Here](http://aourl.me/s/689tfa)

 

Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) **suddenly ran** on February 8th, posting a jaw-dropping performance that came straight out of left field, the broader crypto market has entered a lull. While there have been a few notable movers, like Binance Coin (BNB), the broader digital asset class has all but stopped moving. Price action has effectively come to a standstill.

This has left many asking, what’s next for the cryptocurrency market? While one analyst couldn’t give a definitive answer on whether BTC will move higher or lower, he argues that a breakout is festering, and is inbound.

[Bitcoin Charts](https://i.redd.it/ocd0j4e7w8h21.jpg)

 

## Analyst Hints At Bitcoin Breakout

Josh Rager, an advisor to TokenBacon and Blackwave, recently took to Twitter to convey some analysis regarding Bitcoin’s chart. While Josh didn’t have any explicit predictions, due to the non-volatility in BTC’s value, he did note that as the cryptocurrency has yet to break under its “weekly historical support level,” it is likely building its “next strong move.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Josh's Tweet ](https://i.redd.it/4p1un9j5x8h21.png)

 

As aforementioned, he didn’t definitively or tacitly mention what which Bitcoin could head after its ends this lull, but considering theories regarding the “Bart Formation,” some believers claim that BTC could plummet just as fast as it rallied on February 8th.

Josh’s recent comment comes after he took to his Twitter soapbox to make an astute comment. Per **previous reports** from this outlet, the popular industry personality remarked that after 2019, potentially only a few in the “general population” will be able to afford an entire BTC. He added that while global income per household figures could swell, due to inflation, solid economic conditions, and other factors, after 2021, BTC’s “speculative value could be out of reach for most.”

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Crypto Could Fall Further

Interestingly, for once in a blue moon, few commentators are sure where the crypto market is headed in the short-term. But as **reported** by NewsBTC previously, the few analysts that have issued forecasts in these mundane market conditions expect losses in the near future.

I do believe companies that have a global presence have issues with moving money around, especially currency conversion.

Could there be LNs that are specific to a given industry or to service supply chains that are transnational?"

What's Grin?

An implementation of MimbleWinble

the private &amp; lightweight MimbleWimble Blockchain

￼

Now in mainnet

Grin mainnet was launched on Jan. 15 2019.

Private Scalable Open

one and only

Grin has no amounts and no addresses. Transactions can be trivially aggregated. To hide where a newly created transaction comes from, it gets relayed privately (a ""random walk"") among peers before it is publicly announced.

MimbleWimble leverages cryptography to allow most of the past transaction data to be removed. This guarantees Grin won't collapse under its own weight in the long term.

Grin is developed openly, by developers distributed all over the world. It's not controlled by any company, foundation or individual. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible.

"Cloud Mining Research

Cloud mining profitability described. Research on cloud mining, based on open source data.

The rapid obsolescence of mining equipment and its high price made professional mining not profitable for most users. And this forced both mining service providers and those left behind as a result of this “arms race” to look for alternative solutions. The exit was found quickly enough. Cloud mining.

It seemed to be the revolutionary step in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company buys high-quality and modern equipment for mining, makes it set up and sells to its customers (rents out). Such kind of service made possible for people to join crypto rush without buying and maintaining expensive mining equipment.

However, in the current state, cloud mining business is not profitable. With a growing network’s complexity and “bearish” market it was more or less viable while Bitcoin’s exchange rate stayed high. But after it’s price fall more than in twice - mining rewards are barely enough to cover maintenance fees, not to mention any valuable profit.

As an example of cloud mining industry development, we have collected and analyzed the open-source information about major players of the market and market itself.

Two business models

Generally, there are two main models of the cloud mining business. First, when the company buys equipment itself and provides its customers with cloud mining contracts directly. At first glance, it’s very simple, yet quite complicated for the business, because the company needs to combine both hardware and customers management.

The second one makes the chain longer, replacing one providing company with two different subjects: reselling business and hardware facility. In this model, the quality of service of the reseller directly depends on the endpoint - hardware provider. However, it’s the most popular scheme, due to lower business founding expanses.

Nevertheless, both these models won’t work if the hardware maintenance and service fees are higher than the final profit. And in a case when the final profitability depends on several values, even a small change in one of them may cause the overall business unprofitable. And that was a case of Bitcoin cloud mining. In middle 2018 the network difficulty of the Bitcoin blockchain raised significantly (from 2.6031T in January 2018 to 7.455T in October 2018 and finally to 5.814T in January 2019), while the exchange rate of the cryptocurrency went 70% down.

Consider the example of large market players, how this idea developed and what it turned into in the end.

Cloud mining pioneers

Genesis Mining was founded at the end of 2013 by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Started at the very beginning of the blockchain and cryptocurrency era, it became an enterprise-level solution for cloud mining, with 6 cryptocurrencies listed and 1000 GH hashrate. For each of the listed currencies, Genesis Mining proposed several plans, including 3 preset options and 1 custom solution, where user decide himself how much power he needs.

All things went well until the start of 2016. The issue is that during the 2016 network difficulty of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies raised significantly (in Bitcoin’s case - almost tripled). Yet contracts remained on the same level of proposed hashrate, so the final income of all Genesis users decreased respectively.

Genesis Mining team has foreseen the chance, that someday contracts may become unprofitable, so according to the project’s Terms of Service, if cloud mining contract becomes unprofitable - company stops charging the maintenance fees for next 60 days, hoping that contract will come profitable again.

In order to provide its users with higher quality service and higher chance to get rewarded within their cloud mining contracts, Genesis Mining made several software and hardware updates (last one in early 2018), which but they didn’t help. The last step from the company’s side was making possible to pay maintenance fees in advance to extend the 60-day-holding period, so contractors could prolong their period of waiting for contracts get back profitable. The first complaints in social networks about closed contacts appeared in August 2018.

Limited stocks and sold out contracts

Hashflare was another one major player on the market of cloud mining services since late 2015. With headquarters based in the UK, Hashflare got a number of offices and data centers all around the globe. Main mining facilities, as it is in most of the cases, were placed in Georgia and Iceland due to low electricity cost and legislation loyalty.

Just as Genesis Mining, Hashflare has been proposing various plans for mining various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, ZCash, Dash), however, it was not the only same thing. The payback period of any of these contracts was way too long (around 350-370 days) to be profitable for clients in short and mid-term. And continuously growing network difficulty made them unprofitable for long-term too.

￼

Hashflare strived to make changes in their software and hardware, however, it leads them to nothing. Hashflare’s cloud mining plans are out of stock since July 2018. Also from June 2018 users started talking about closed contracts. There’s still Ethereum plan marked as “Limited stock”, yet nothing happens when you try to buy it.

Awesome partners

Hashing24 was founded in 2015, however, the team behind it was working since early 2012, so it’s legit to say, that the project was made by a group of blockchain and cryptocurrency pioneers. One more fact, staying for Hashing24 is that this cloud mining service used to be an official partner of the blockchain giant - BitFury.

Unlike Genesis Mining and Hashflare, Hashing24 have had no pre-set plans for cloud mining, yet users were free to choose the amount of money they’d want to spend or hashrate volume they’d like to buy. And, as many other services, their contract used to be lifetime-until-profitable.

But after networks’ difficulty rapid rise period, the average contracts payback time got close to 380 days after which contractor meant to start earning his profit. In fact, during this “payback year” network’s difficulty obviously, rise and alleged profit got leveled.

Cloud mining contracts of Hashing 24 got “out of stock” in the middle of 2017.

Since September 2018, the network also has feedback on closed contracts due to negative returns.

Start date - November 18, 2016

Closing the gate

The ease of use of the service is a distinctive feature of MinerGate since 2014. Thanks to this, the pool has gained such popularity among beginners. The launch of cloud contracts on a pool that often experiments with new services was a matter of time.

The sale of cloud contracts started on MinerGate at the end of 2016. All contracts were for life, that is, they were considered active as long as they generate revenue. Despite the growing complexity of Bitcoin, MinerGate continued to keep contract yields at an acceptable level. How exactly is not clear, but since the profitability equation is made up of the cost of electricity, which remained almost unchanged over the period of popularity of cloud contracts, the efficiency of the miner and the need for its maintenance, which was charged regularly, it is most likely a matter of partner diversification.

It is highly likely that MinerGate was a common intermediary involving various providers in the execution of cloud contracts. But such a scheme could not exist in the market for a long time.

Cloud contracts cannot be bought from late September 2018. In January 2019, many contracts began to show sharply reduced returns In February, feedback about the closure of cloud contracts began to appear on the network. The main question is why so long?

Start of sales - December 2016 (presumably).

The end of sales - 2018 late September

Irrelevance of strategic partnership

In 2014, Hashnest was acquired by Bitmain, which became a supplier and service company for cloud mining. For Bitmain, this was the first experience of buying a startup in the field of cloud mining. At that time, the company was actively expanding its competencies, trying to become a leader in everything related to mining.

A distinctive feature of Hashnest was also the marketplace, where users could buy power from each other.

The user could buy as power for 1 day or buy ASIC in permanent possession. However, with a negative yield of more than 5 days, the contract ceased to be executed and was considered terminated.

Now it is impossible to buy new contracts, the marketplace is not displayed, and the support of the service claims that the work will be resumed from day to day. Without naming time. In social networks, you can find a lot of feedback from people whose contracts were closed at the end of 2018.

The solution to technology and geography?

These cases demonstrate how strongly Bitcoin price and network complexity affect profitability and the ability to continue mining. But is it possible to improve the quality of equipment and lower electricity prices will be able to return services to the game?

Traditionally, mining was concentrated in countries that provided minimal electricity tariffs.

Pay attention to Georgia, Viniswell, Russia, and China. Reducing the cost of electricity allowed to multiply increase profits.

Most popular ASICs profitability in different countries

In addition to the price of electricity, it is important to take into account the overall level of infrastructure and political stability in the country. For this reason, Venezuela, with its low electricity prices, is not the first choice. At the same time, relocation often involves such expenses that the transportation of equipment may make this operation unprofitable.

But everything again broke about the increase in the complexity and cost of the ASICs themselves. The growth of complexity depreciated the new devices in 2 months, transforming the payback process from monthly to annual. At the same time, the devices are not going to become cheaper, since the part of research and development behind them must also be paid off.

The situation with ASICs looks really bad. Even those devices that show profits simply do not have time to work out their own value before obsolescence. Difficulty grows faster, and the Bitcoin continues to fall.

So, this is it?

From the examples above, it becomes obvious that even large players cannot support the infrastructure of cloud mining against the background of the growing complexity of the network and “bearish” market trends. The solution that would allow realizing the entire idea of cloud mining is currently not profitable.

Most of these businesses were founded with a view to the exact network difficulty and the specific exchange rate of the Bitcoin. As soon as both these criteria have changed in the worst possible way (difficulty went higher when the price went lower), such kind of industry doesn’t work.

For those who do not have their own computing power or coins based on the Proof of Stake algorithm, but would like to mine cryptocurrency - rental of hashrate directly from other users and connecting leased power to mining pools is a more preferable option.

I feel like everyone is buying the hype and is truly believing we are going though another bull run like 2016..  I honestly have not bought this hype and I’m still waiting for BTC to dump even more..  

"The narrative that another crypto is the real Bitcoin is causing I am certain real people who are being misled to lose money by either investing in something that they don't intend to by accident or because they are being given misinformation, facilitated by the ownership of [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com).

As has been mentioned before, if BCH supporters were sincere in their belief that bcash is superior to BTC, they would make the distinction clear, even sell the domain.

A clear indication of their desire to derive benefit from the confusion is discussion of BCH vs BTC so often whereas a rational approach would be to discuss its merits over another crypto that it is closer to in marketcap -- it is in danger of slipping another notch below a competitor so that it could well instead of being #6 it will become #7 which I believe is a very big problem in terms of credibility. They should be discussing merits over this crypto in an attempt to prevent this slippage.

But instead it is only btc and lightning network that are discussed and denigrated -- is the only strategy that bcash supporters can come up with to take advantage of confusion and attempt to boost bch by (I guess) knocking a crypto with 30 times its marketcap? This to me shows (and I am not a psychiatrist) something like delusions of grandeur if that is the right sort of diagnosis.

I doubt that my advice will be taken but I would take smaller and presumably more effective steps and attempt to encourage people to see the merits of bch over binance coin which could in the next few days overtake bch in marketcap. Even Stellar is a danger to them. And if trading volume is an important measure, even ethereuem classic is a competitor."





"I recently made a post on the beginner sub and mentioned I was using this wallet and someone replied saying:
“Why on earth you are using a wallet which does not even have any traffic on it, I am not sure if you were advised to do so, but please use some wallet which keeps your cryptos safe. After all its your hard earned money.”

I’m a total noob and only have about $100 in BTC right now and was keeping it on Coinbase. But after reading stuff here I thought I was seeing a lot of good things about this wallet so I got it and sent my satoshis there. I eventually want to get a Trezor but not until I have enough bitcoin to justify buying it. Will I be ok using Hodl Wallet for now?

Thanks!"

"Theoretically, if you were mining using a bog-standard PC on your own (not as part of a pool), there’s a very slim chance that you will solve the proof of work on a valid block and claim all fees and block reward, right? Obviously the chances are minuscule but how do they compare with the odds of winning the lottery jackpot?

For example, if you bought a lottery ticket every week for a year, are you more likely to win the lottery than if you mined on a normal PC in the same year?"

"What I see on this cryptocurrency logic for now is this:

We don't usually trade goods and services with bitcoins/cryptocurrencies, we almost just trade them for another fiat currency we use today and that determines it price.

For me, the logic is like this:

-&gt; Miner mines 1 bitcoin

-&gt; Buyer 1 wants to buy 1 bitcoin for 40 USD

-&gt; Buyer 2 wants to buy 1 bitcoin for 60 USD

-&gt; Miner sells it to buyer 2 for 60 USD and the current price is 60 USD against 1 BTC.

-&gt; Buyer 2 wants to buy for example a bottle of wine for 60 usd but he only has 1 bitcoin which will for sure not be accepted by the liqour store he then sells it for 60 USD.

-&gt; Buyer 3 and Buyer 4 wants to buy the 1 bitcoin only for 40 USD so Buyer 2 has no choice but to sell because he needs something that the liquor store will accept so this results into bitcoin being valued at 1BTC to 40 USD for now.

so in short its value depends on how much fiat currency are people willing to trade with it. this ain't real money for me since it's still connected to a fiat currency which people usually trade with BTC.

I'm curious what will happen for example instead of defining its value from a fiat currency, people started selling goods and services for bitcoin without relying on the exchange rates.

For example:

People makes a starting fixed rate for goods and services like this:

1KG of chicken = 0.015 BTC

1KG of pork = 0.012 BTC

in short, all im asking is what if a country for example relied on pricing of goods and services on bitcoin without thinking of the fiat currency exchange rate? instead they make a fixed price and adjust the pricing of BTC depending on the demand of the chicken and the pork or simply goods and services not because of the changing of its equivalent fiat currency?

My question is to people around before me who have seen many bull runs. I’d like to know if they usually play out the same as the last, as in, BTC has a run first then alts follow.

"Basic economics suggests us that increasing transaction fees will reduce usage... This usage will instead spill over to other competing coins, which is a loss for Bitcoin.
