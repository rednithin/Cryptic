"Over the past year, I try to stay away from price related tweets, but it’s hard because price is such an important aspect of Litecoin growth. And whenever I tweet about Litecoin price or even just good or bads news, I get accused of doing it for personal benefit. Some people even think I short LTC! So in a sense, it is conflict of interest for me to hold LTC and tweet about it because I have so much influence. I have always refrained from buying/selling LTC before or after my major tweets, but this is something only I know. And there will always be a doubt on whether any of my actions were to further my own personal wealth above the success of Litecoin and crypto-currency in general.

For this reason, in the past days, I have sold/donated all my LTC. Litecoin has been very good for me financially, so I am well off enough that I no longer need to tie my financial success to Litecoin’s success. For the first time in 6+ years, I no longer own a single LTC that’s not stored in a physical Litecoin. (I do have a few of those as collectibles.) This is definitely a weird feeling, but also somehow refreshing. Don’t worry. I’m not quitting Litecoin. I will still spend all my time working on Litecoin. When Litecoin succeeds, I will still be rewarded in lots of different ways, just not directly via ownership of coins. I now believe this is the best way for me to continue to oversee Litecoin’s growth.

Please don’t ask me how many coins I sold or at what price. I can tell you that the amount of coins was a small percentage of GDAX’s daily volume and it did not crash the market.

UPDATE: I wrote the above before the recent Bcash on GDAX/Coinbase fiasco. As you can see, some people even think I’m pumping Bcash for my personal benefit. It seems like I just can’t win."
"I originally invested $3700 with an average of $67 ish. I rode it all the way down and HODL'd at $38 in August. Today woke up and while laying in bed cashed out $19,900 worth. Student loans were $16K so I got my original investment back and plus enough to treat my girlfriend to a nice dinner - Cracker Barrel ha!  Was a wild ride. Good luck to you all. Wish nothing but the best. 

IM DEBT FREE!!!


Edit:

Still have less than 10 coins in for tax purposes."
"In the last 24 hours, I have received in my wallet a sum of litecoin which I did not purchase nor transfer to myself.


If this is your transaction, send me with a signed msg of that tx

Edit: Thanks for the gold, but LTC would be better :P

Edit 2: People are PMing me with ""is it ..."" messages. Don't guess you fuckers.

UPDATE#2: 

Update: 

Looks like we as a LITECOIN COMMUNITY have made it to the TOP of the 2nd Page on Reddit! We also mooned through 777 upvotes and I'm truly delighted to be giving away LTC to a lucky someone...

**Change of plans though, I'll be giving away .777 to 7 different people! If we can reach 7,777 votes these will be paid out...**

**If we can't hit 7,777 upvotes and this thread starts to fizzle out...then I will give away the .777 LTC to a lucky someone that posted their LTC address here in this thread.** 

**(See update in donation log update)** - *On top of .777 LTC being paid out to 7 lucky people at 7,777 votes, I've received a private donation to facilitate a .333 LTC payout to 7 lucky people once the thread reaches 3,333 upvotes*

If you need a LTC address please use Coinbase, Poloniex, or Bittrex for a LTC wallet. Loaf wallet is also an option...Best option is to buy a LITECOIN HARDWARE WALLET made by Ledger! 

LETS GET TO THE FIRST PAGE ON REDDIT! WE ARE SOOOOOO CLOSE! 

.............................................................................................................................................................

UPDATE#3: 

**First and foremost WELCOME all the new faces here in the /r/litecoin subreddit** 

**Secondly, THANKS TO EVERYONE for the the kind words and vibes as the abundant support is so refreshing for everyone here in this community, including myself and all the hodlers!**

Moving on with it I've received various messages asking to help donate to this cause here. Many people want to donate in many different ways. Some people want me to just have their LTC hit my wallet and then be directly sent to the Litecoin Foundation in their honor. Some people want to add certain amounts of LTC to the donation amounts in which I will be paying people here in this thread for participating. Even some have suggested they add in extra benchmarks such as 3,333 upvotes being achieved. Basically, everyone and their kitty kat wanna donate to this cause, and for that I'm so delighted to be apart of all this. This is all for the community of Litecoin and the long term upbringing of a currency that deserves much more limelight! This is my contribution to the matter and really hope we as a community can make a change and get more people interested in Crypto Currency as a whole, and more specifically LITECOIN!

"Spent $3860 + fees in february and my wife almost killed me. Just sold 1/4 of my LTC @ 178.25 and will be paying off 1 car, 1 CC, and the balance of 2 student loans.  You guys are the real heros in all of this. HODL what you got!

I probably should add that with the 1k/mo I'll be saving, I will be buying more LTC for at least the next year.  

Edit - the only thing that sucks was I sold @ 178, when I could have waited 12 hours and sold at 250.  However, my 750 left are now worth more than my 1000 were this morning!  Keep HODLING BOYS!"
Wow my first gold! Thank you very much!

"Back in 2013 I paid $10k (approx) for 400 LTC at about $23 each (numbers may not add up as I am not from the US and exchange rates etc make it all a bit confusing).

I actually bought at a bad time - they were dropping after a big pump, and I decided that it was a small dip and bought in.

The price then continued to drop, to my dismay, all the way down to <$5. I'd lost $7500. What a huge mistake.

I was devastated and decided to just stop watching the price and see what happened in the future.

In June this year I saw news that BTC was rallying and decided to see if LTC was also following suite - it was! LTC was at about $35. I'd almost doubled my initial investment. 

So I quickly tried to log into the exchange I used to buy my 400 LTC and found that they'd been sold to another larger exchange.

(I'm deliberately omitting the names of the exchanges but anyone who knows the market well will be able to figure it out I guess).

Anyway, the message I saw on the exchange website said:

'This exchange has been sold to <newExchange>. 
Your account and all functionality remains online and accessible at <newExchange>. 

So I went to <newExchange> and tried to log in with my original details - no dice.

I emailed <newExchange> and was told that migration was a manual process, and I should have received an email 2 years prior informing me of this.

I pressed for more info and was told, in no uncertain terms, that there was nothing else they could do to help.

Fuck.

So I started research the original exchange, and found the name of the founder (I won't name him). Using this info I then found his reddit account, his linkedin profile and his twitter account, and pinged him on all these platforms. I was polite and non-confrontational. I simply asked where my coins were, and if he could help.

No reply.

So I dug deeper.

I found an article linking the original exchange with a criminal investigation for fraud - a DEA agent had been employed by them for to aid with compliance, and he had then stolen a bunch of BTC from customer accounts. The case was investigated by the IRS, and he was caught - it was a big story at the time.

The same article named the IRS Special Agent, and I then found him on linkedin. So I messaged him with the following:

> Hi (agentName>, I would love to connect so I can share some information about <originalExchange> and further possible fraud. I hope you will accept.

Within 1 minute I had a reply:

> Hi xxx. Give me a call at xxx-xxx-xxx or email me at xxx.xxx@ci.irs.gov

I thanked him, and then sent an email with all the evidence: emails with headers, screenshots, bank statements and transaction records from okpay. Everything.

Silence.

So a couple of weeks later I called him. He had just got off a plane in The Hague on some other, non-related investigation. We chatted for about 30 minutes.

He was very sympathetic, although he did ask me why I hadn't withdrawn my coins into a private wallet. My answer was 'I had no idea I had to'. I was a noob, after all, and I had stupidly assumed my coins were safe.

I followed up our chat with an email:

>Nice speaking to you earlier xxx.

> It occurred to me that there are a couple of key questions about my case:

> 1. Can a financial investment company operating under US compliance laws legally liquidate/sell a customers investment without notifying them?

> 2. Is there a time limit after which a company can acquire a customers investment from a dormant account?

> I have filed a complaint at the FBI cyber crimes portal https://www.ic3.gov/complaint/

> There is a chance I can trace my purchase of litecoins as I know the time window, and I know the price and amount (about 400 based on buying $10000USD worth). As you said, this probably doesn't help but I just wanted to document it.

A couple more weeks passed, and I got more and more despondent as LTC continued to rise in value.

Then I got a linkedin message from the founder of <orginalExchange>.

> xxx here. The site's been down for years but I may be able to see if my former cofounder can look you up on a backup of the wallets he has

> can you email me your <orginalExchange> username, the email you used, and the ID #?

Holy shit!

Within a few days I had my 400 LTC in my new wallet, and have held them ever since.

My initial investment is now worth $61k -  a sweet 50k(+/-) profit.

So there you go - my rather silly lesson. I expect a fair amount of abuse, but you know what - I know, I know. My coins are safe, I'm holding for now (probably for many years) and no crime was committed.

Thank you IRS guy, thank you <originalExchange> founder for being honest, and thank you LTC for being a great investment.

Just thought I'd share.

(you can actually see my original post to this subreddit when I realised my coins were awol if you look at my profile - and the rather disheartening reply)

"After many months of dollar cost averaging into BTC, just this morning I was about to invest another chunk of fiat into it. To my horror, on a transaction of £150 ($202) the network fee was £14 ($19)!! Almost 10%!!

So I opted against it, and after considering it for a few months I bought LTC. For the same fiat investment, the transaction cost me only 5p (7 cents) on the Litecoin network. About 0.033%!

And to top it all off, the transaction time was far quicker than what I've been used to with BTC

I still believe in BTC as a long term store of wealth, however, it's became quite clear to me now that LTC really could replace fiat currency as we know it, unless major improvements are made to the Bitcoin network.

TL;DR equivalent £150 transaction would have cost me 10% in fees on BTC but I opted for LTC which only cost me 0.033% in fees"
"Conditions ripe for big gains thru Saturday:

- Wednesday sell off has prices in a nice dip
- optimism about a US tax break should counter any worries about the Fed interest rate hike
- one more week until a possible govt shutdown, this delay should give the bulls another week to place bets
If you’re planning on buying this dip, all signs point to a good move Thursday morning into the evening.

###Scam Warning

Hey guys. There have been numerous scammers lately who have been private messaging redditors. Their goal is for you to send Litecoins to their address. So far, they've followed the same writing template. It looks something like this: https://imgur.com/0UZczuz

If someone is telling you to send to a Litecoin address they are providing, DON'T. They're trying to steal your Litecoins. If you're not sure, read the wealth of knowledge below or comment below and I will eventually get to you.


###Welcome to /r/Litecoin!
 
(Re-post of u/Sparkswont cuz it was archived)

Whether you're new to cryptocurrency and have no clue what a 'litecoin' is, or a seasoned investor in cryptocurrencies, the resources below will answer all your questions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask below in the comments!
 
&nbsp;
 
##What is Litecoin?
 
Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin is one of the largest, oldest, and most used cryptocurrencies in the world. Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin uses blockchain technology to process transactions.
 
So what's the difference? To process a block, Litecoin takes 2.5 minutes rather than Bitcoins 10 minutes. This allows for faster processing times. Litecoin also has the capability to produce a total of 84 million units, compared to Bitcoins 21 million. In addition, Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm, a sequential memory-hard function requiring asymptotically more memory than an algorithm which is not memory-hard.
 
Still confused? Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0buY7giI3o)!
 
&nbsp;
 
##Where can I buy Litecoin?
 
There are many websites and applications where you can buy and sell Litecoin, but make sure the exchange you are using is trusted and secure. Here are some exchanges that are trusted in the cryptocurrency community:
 
| Exchange |
|:--|
|[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) *USD/Euro/GBP*|
|[Quadrigacx](https://www.quadrigacx.com) *CAD*|
|[Coinsquare](https://coinsquare.io/) *CAD* |
|[Bithump](https://www.bithumb.com/) *KRW*|
|[OKCoin](https://www.okcoin.com/) *Euro/Yen/USD*|
|[OKex](https://www.okex.com/) *CNY* |
|[Btcmarkets.net](https://www.btcmarkets.net/) *AUD* |
|[Bitso](https://bitso.com/) *MXN* |
|[Zebpay](https://www.zebpay.com/) *INR* |

&nbsp;
 
##Where can I securely store Litecoin?
 
Litecoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is stored in a digital wallet. When storing Litecoin, you want to make sure you trust the place you store them. This is why it is best to store them yourself through the [electrum wallet](https://electrum-ltc.org/). It is highly suggested to not store your Litecoin in an exchange (such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc.) because you don't control the private keys. If the exchange ever goes offline, or becomes insolvent, your Litecoin essentially disappear.
 
Some other options are:
 
Wallet|
:--|:--
[Electrum Lightweight Wallet](https://electrum-ltc.org/)|
[Official Core Wallet](https://litecoin.org/#download)|
[LiteVault Secure Web Wallet](https://www.litevault.net/)|
[Paper Wallet Instructions](https://www.theliteschool.com/lsc/2018/3/23/7-creating-a-paper-wallet)|

 
&nbsp;
 
If you're a fan of mobile devices, then [Loafwallet](http://loafwallet.org/) is the wallet for you. Developed by a Litecoin Foundation Dev, /u/losh11, this mobile wallet works great!  And remember to always make sure to **write down your seedkeys.**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hardware wallets are another great option, in fact, they are said to be the most secure way to store cryptocurrencies. Below is a list of the litecoin flexible hardware wallets.

##Where can I spend Litecoin?
 
Litecoin is in the [top ten of all cryptocurrencies](https://coinmarketcap.com/) by market capitalization. Websites are rapidly adopting Litecoin as a method of payment as well.  If you yourself want to accept LTC as a business, you can refer to these [merchant manuals](https://medium.com/the-litecoin-school-of-crypto/merchants/home).  Alternatively, if you would like to explore websites that accept Litecoin, head over to /r/AcceptingLTC.
 
Here are also several of our [favorite merchants](http://www.uselitecoin.info/) accepting Litecoin.
 
&nbsp;
 
##Where can I discuss Litecoin?
 
The Litecoin community is extremely kind and robust. There are many forums and places where you can discuss Litecoin with others who are interested in the currency. Here are the main ones:
 
Platform|
:--|:--
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/)|
[Litecoin Markets Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmarkets)|
[Discord](https://discord.gg/AFkPpC2)|
[Official Forum](https://litecointalk.org/)|
[IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23litecoinmining%2C%23litecoin)|

"The game HAS changed. The only people freaking out are the people who are either here only to get rich quick, or who can't critically think and see the whole picture.

First of all, this is currency traded as a commodity. This isn't a stock and Litecoin isn't a company. So Charlie Lee getting out literally cannot be compared to ANYTHING. So stop trying to. Second of all, it's true what they say about him. He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Anyone paying attention already knows that.

I watched the Litecoin stream last night. So many good things are coming. Charlie donating all his coins is an absolute MUST with what is coming. Look across the isle at Bitcoin and Bcash. Right now Roger Ver is pretty much the figurehead for Bcash. He's using his extreme wealth to buy air time and push his ideological agenda. I'm not here to argue his ideologies or what Bcash stands for. What I can tell you is that Roger Ver is using his money to influence the market by promoting Bcash and spreading insane FUD about Bitcoin. The price is going to go nuts, there will be political ramifications, and many people are going to lose money. In time, this will come back to bite him in the ass.

Now, Charlie is the figurehead for Litecoin. He's been pushing marketing for the coin and the Litecoin Foundation is kicking it into high gear by utilizing marketing firms and no doubt getting on TV even more...among other things like merchandising. You cannot have Charlie hamstrung like that. He cannot do certain things for promotion when he has a stake in what he's selling. He will end up looking like Roger Ver (albeit a very genuinely nice version of him) if he did.

When you invest in Litecoin you invest in what it stands for and you back the developer team pushing it into the future. Charlie getting out is like untying the ball and chain. He is now 100% free to push this shit to the extreme because now NOBODY can say ""oh, he's just shilling for his coin because he's making a killing.""

Open your eyes and see the big picture."
Nothing more to this. Just wanted people to know that there are people out there who bought at a worse time than them

"As days go by, its getting more apparent that the guy is all over the place, from walking out,to being a general dick, to now Litepay failure( at-least hyping a failed venture)

Lets give him what he wanted( when he sold his coins) 

That he not have any weight or voice to litecoin and its development. 

We are obsessed with pseudo figures and want a “god like” figure to make litecoin successful. 

The community is more powerful than one 

Don’t care if i am down-voted by the fan boys. Its time to be strong as a community and let this guy go. 

. All successful leaders have calm demeanor, clear vision for the product and do their due diligence  before hyping up a major initiative/product 

He is not a leader, never was and never will be. If you hold even 0.1 LTC you have a bigger voice than the guy who sold everything and sits on a beach and tells us how to run the community. "

So let’s embrace the ride.  We’ll get there someday. And if we don’t, it’s only 12%.  Hopefully you can relate.

"Fellow Consumers,

It's possible that you might be getting a little upset at the current BTC fees. Please assist me in sending, or editing as you see fit, this drafted outline and email to whichever business you feel would benefit from using Litecoin instead. Or you can make a video, or tweet the link, or 100 other things. Just help in bringing attention to Litecoin in BTC's mempool time of need. It's time they learned Litecoin's biggest secret .... It’s **THE BEST** payment method out there. Also, please support businesses that currently accept Litecoin. I've put together a list below the draft.

To whom it may concern,

Has your company ever considered receiving the alternative payment currency Litecoin? 

To begin, you may already be accepting bitcoin and Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin. If you're unfamiliar with bitcoin as a currency then Litecoin is a great place to start. They are even built from the same Core coding. A benefit to Litecoin is that it has a 2.5 minute block time instead of bitcoin's 10 minutes. This makes Litecoin's transaction speed four times faster and much less expensive than bitcoin. In layman's terms, this just means payment is confirmed faster and less expensively with Litecoin.

For reference - you can see the average fee of both bitcoin and Litecoin in US Dollars compared here:
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-ltc.html#1y


This chart shows the average fee for Litecoin is staying around 10 to 20 cents, and bitcoin bouncing between a low of $1.50 and $8.00 recently.
This means you would pay less in fees to convert the same total value into fiat or USD in this case. 

If you were to compare this to the average credit card transaction fees, of  say 2.5%, any transaction over $5.00 would be more profitable through Litecoin. 

Reference of fees found here: https://www.cardfellow.com/average-fees-for-credit-card-processing/#Typical

If you've heard of Litecoin, I'm sure you have heard the saying ""Litecoin is the silver to bitcoin's gold."" But really, Litecoin should really be considered Platinum instead of silver. Platinum is stronger, more durable, and much more ductile. Over 20% of all consumer goods either contain platinum or are produced using platinum. Platinum is truly an enduring metal just as Litecoin is truly an enduring cryptocurrency. It will be 6 years old this October, bitcoin is 8 years old. 

A few facts that demonstrate Litecoin's strength, durability, and ductility are listed below:

1. Litecoin has a large economy and your current bitcoin technology should work on Litecoin with very little changes. If you don't use bitcoin, it is still easy to implement.

2. Litecoin has the best combination of economic size and technical similarity to bitcoin than any other cryptocurrencies.

3. Litecoin is capable of eight times as many transactions as bitcoin in a ten minute period.

4. Litecoin has much faster confirmation times with blocks that are not full.

5. Litecoin has proven its longevity compared to many other cryptocurrencies that have come and gone.

6. Also, if changes ever need to be made to Litecoin, it doesn't take years to implement them. Litecoin implemented Segregated Witness before bitcoin, and will most likely run on the lightning network before bitcoin as well. If you don't deal with bitcoin, this all just means Litecoin is a front runner in implementing new technology and features.

7. Litecoin is a limited supply coin, launched fairly, with no coins premined (no developer is hiding a majority somewhere), nor has it ever hard forked for any special interest groups. It is decentralized and no one person or group controls what happens to it and no one person or group can manipulate the market.

8. Whole Litecoins are much more affordable than whole bitcoins. This helps eliminate some psychological barriers to entering the market. 

In conclusion: 

If your company was to accept Litecoin, I would be happy to start conducting my business with you.

If your company accepts bitcoin payments but not Litecoin, I hope I have helped shed some light on the benefits Litecoin could bring to your business. 

If your business does not accept bitcoin payments, I hope I have introduced you to an alternative payment option that a large number of people transact with everyday who would love to add you to their list of merchants accepting Litecoin. It really is the currency of the future.

If you have any questions about Litecoin or need help in possibly implementing Litecoin into your business, please let us know. There are many of us here excited to help you transition into accepting Litecoin or to help you further and answer any questions you may have.

That is what you ask yourselves *BEFORE* you buy and sell. 
"We are a young company from Sweden producing jerky out of reindeer, deer and elk meat. Even if our company sounds like it is an old school manufacturing business we have young minds! Today we started accepting LTC through Coinpayments. We also accept other cryptos.

The reason for us to start accepting LTC is the fact that all of us three founders are cryptomaniacs and we truly believe in its usability and in it long term. It is too sad to see that holders of LTC cannot actually spend their coins on too many e-commerces but are forced to buy their goods with fiat. We want to be one of the first ones to change this!

We believe that we are the first food company in Sweden that accepts cryptocurrency as a payment method and we would love to see other companies following us.

If you are located in European Union and would like to exchange your litecoins to something truly delicious and unique check out: **https://www.renjer.ky** and order some juicy jerky.

**Note that due to food regulations we can only sell to EU countries!**"
"There are a couple of coins that are going to pan out long term because of their tech and partnerships, etc. The rest are long shots and garbage coins. Right now we are in limbo, and you’re seeing a big shell game being played. Lots of people are making money jumping from one coin to the next, riding one pump to the next. Pumping the coin of the day, then bashing it as they cash out and hop to the next. It’s all hot air but traders are having fun. If you’re not playing that game you need to sit tight with the coins you believe in long term and wait for real traction. And ignore the noise from the traders in the meantime. They’re all over reddit trying to manipulate you. Half the blogs you read are doing the same thing btw. Do your own research and try (it’s hard) to separate fact from fiction."
"Seems to me like the guy just wanted to appear unbiased in his opinions and representations of the company.  This seems highly important to him given his past statements. I now just see his selling as an integrity move and I'm HODL'n on!

http://www.businessinsider.com/litecoin-creator-charlie-lee-sells-entire-ltc-holding-2017-12. "
"Let me respond to all the criticism. Let me start off by saying that this post will likely piss off many of you. People bought LTC and are part of this community for various reasons. Everything I do or say will upset some part of this community. And I don't really care to be honest.

If you have been following Litecoin for more than 3 years, you will know that Litecoin is boring. I would be lying if I said it wasn't. Litecoin, for some unknown reason, is always very stable with USD. I have no idea why, but it is this way. Whenever Bitcoin pumps, LTC/BTC crashes, and that makes it stable with respect to USD. Whenever Bitcoin crashes, LTC/BTC goes up a bit. Some for 99% of the time Litecoin is really boring. It stayed around $4 for like 3 years! And it pumped to $50 and now seems to stabilizing around $45. Bitcoin can go to $5000 tomorrow and I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see Litecoin stay at $45. I believe in the future, LTC will go up in value. Maybe the next time, it will go to $400 in a few months. No one knows if or when that will happen. So the key is to be patient and to Hodl. Long time Litecoin supporters know this, and those are not the people that are crying foul today.

If you expect me to pump LTC to make you rich, I am not going to do that. I do not work for you. You are not investing in a corporation where I am the CEO and I work to make investors money. This is not how decentralized currencies work. If you don't appreciate that and don't like it, then please sell your LTC. Your investment into LTC does not go to me or the Litecoin developers. Litecoin will succeed if people invest their energies into Litecoin. Just buying LTC does nothing. So if you don't like the direction of where Litecoin marketing is going, do the work and help market it the way you want. Don't expect me to be doing that!

My vision for Litecoin is always silver to Bitcoin's gold. That's not going to change. I will be touting that whenever I can. I see Litecoin working side by side with Bitcoin to address the need for decentralized currency. I hate to break it to you, but Litecoin will never overtake Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be the king. No matter how much I want that to change, it's not going to happen. And I am fine with that and will work towards a future where both BTC and LTC are used my everyone. If you believe that's wrong, that's fine. Go tweet about it as much as you want and go on CNBC to say that. I'm not going to do that because I don't believe it to be the case.

I've said this before and I will say it again. Ask not what Litecoin can do for you. Ask what you can do for Litecoin. Go forth and make it happen. This is a decentralized currency. You don't get to sit back and enjoy the profits from other people's hard work.

Sorry if I upset you, but I won't change. :(

"Bought in around $85/LTC and made a $3400 investment on 29 Nov and sold today(14 Dec) for $316.  I wanted to hold on longer but my wife and I have a baby on the way, needed to pay down some debt from doing in-vitro fertilization, and the last thing I wanted to do was risk losing the chunk of savings we had put away over the last year or so.

I didn't know a lot about crypto or how to buy it just 4 weeks ago but I learned a lot from this sub.  I chose to move my money to LTC because my stock portfolio had lost value over the last year and was stagnate.  Buying and selling LTC was a big game changer and I am more financially stable because of you guys.

For those that are still holding, I hope you make huge gains in the coming months/years.  

Thanks for everything.  "
"Hi, I wanted to share my experience with running a (geeky and niche) crypto dice site. For a year we supported only Bitcoin, we only added Litecoin only a week ago.

For the last week the amout of litecoins played (over 9 200 LTC wagered) on our site was 3 times more than amount of bitcoins played (52 BTC wagered). I was definitely NOT expecting it at all. And no, we did not spend a fortune on advertizing, but we had (still have) a competition for early Litecoin players. Still, I am shocked.

This confirms why Litecoin matters in the cryptocurrency planescape:

I think the claims that ""only Bitcoin matters"" or ""Litecoin is just a shadow of Bitcoin"" are not justified.

Litecoin has a potential - it's true it is a conservative coin, but it's really lightweight, fast and network fees are low. Shorter confirmation times really matter too. I think there are three coins that really matter now:

1. Bitcoin - obviously, it's the most established one, but it bacame slow and expensive to use (maybe LN can save it),
2. Ethereum - bleeding edge of innovation, could solve some real-world problems some day with its large potential.
3. Litecoin - lighweight, solves real problems that Bitcoin suffers from but still simple enough for daily use.

The only thing Litecoin IMO needs is wider adoption. I hope it can get it!

So.... let the Litecoin grow! Thanks!

"A lot of people have been saying that segwit is unsafe because segwit coins are ""anyone-can-spend"" and can be stolen. So lets put this to the test. I put up $1MM of LTC into a segwit address. You can see it's a segwit address because I sent and spent 1 LTC first to reveal the redeemscript.

https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ltc/address.dws?3MidrAnQ9w1YK6pBqMv7cw5bGLDvPRznph.htm

Let's see if segwit really is ""anyone-can-spend"" or not.

Good luck.

EDIT 1: There is some confusion - if I spend the funds normally, you will see a valid signature. If the funds are claimed with so called ""anyone-can-spend"" there will not be a signature. It will be trivial to see how the funds were moved and how.

EDIT 2: Just to make it easier for here is a raw hex transaction that sends all the funds to fees for any miner who wants to try and steal the funds.

"Stored a few Ltc in an online wallet maybe a few years ago. Forgot what the web wallet was called. Is there any place where i can see all the online wallets urls maybe inlcuding the older ones?

Edit: I'm really thankful for all the replies and upvotes. Frankly, i thought this post would be buried but this community is awesome and helped me a lot. I came to the conclusion that my LTC might be stored in LiteVault but unfortunately all my emails i remember are invalid to retrieve my identifier. I might of stupidly forgot the email i used.

"This whole banks banning credit cards from being used on crypto is inadvertently good, people cant spend money they don’t actually have and lose it. The recession we had in ‘08 literally happened because people we’re talking out loans they couldn’t afford and the banks allowed it. This time banks are stopping it, this is good and we should focus on upcoming technology such as litepay rather than freak out for no reason."

"This is amazing and, because of this, I'm reminded of why LTC's one of my favorite cryptos long term.
Friends, the future is now."
"It's been a pretty eventful few weeks for litecoin, with a lot of information flying around. Hype, FUD, rumors, and opinions. It's been exciting. The main topic of conversation overall seems to be Charlie selling his coins, but if you are a true HODLer and you have followed Charlie for a while, this doesn't seem that outrageous. And it certainly does not do anything to change the underlying reason I own Litecoin. If anything, I would hope that it has given people who believe in the technology another chance to accumulate LTC at the expense of short-term speculators.

In my opinion the more important tweet of that weekend was this one: https://i.imgur.com/NAzlnqm.jpg which sparked a lot of rumors of Facebook and Amazon, since which Charlie has squashed. But what might these mean? I'd like to give my .02ł. (Note this is pure uncut speculation. I’m typing out my ass)


* Merchant Processor: **BitPay** 
https://bitpay.com/

BitPay is the obvious choice here- they just [raised a $30 million round of funding](https://medium.com/bitpay-on-bitcoin/bitcoin-payments-leader-bitpay-raising-30-million-in-series-b-funding-led-by-aquiline-technology-367dfe2e10f2) and are acutely aware of their customers pain in dealing with BTC’s high fees. They [raised the minimum payment to $100](https://blog.bitpay.com/minimum-invoice-update/) and then quickly lowered it to $5, but they mention in that post that they are scrambling to allow BCH payments. I think they are putting their new funding to work to support Litecoin payments too. 



* Popular Online Wallet: **Blockchain.info** 
https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/

Blockchain.info had the most popular online BTC wallet for a long time. They hit their [3 millionth wallet in 2015](https://cointelegraph.com/news/feb-24-digest-blockchaininfo-reaches-3-millionth-wallet-bitcoin-payment-option-disappears-from-wordpress) and held out as BTC-only all the way up to August of this year, [when they added Ethereum](https://blog.blockchain.com/2017/08/17/blockchain-wallet-adds-ether/). They are clearly opening up to new currencies:
>""By adding ether as a new currency, we’re providing users with a new diverse way to interact with the digital economy.” 

I think Litecoin will be the new diversity soon. 



* Goods Trading Platform: **OpenBazaar**

So it’s already a bit out of the bag that OpenBazaar is looking to add more support for other cryptocurrencies, but Litecoin hasn’t been officially announced, and it is definitely in the works. This interaction took place back in April: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/849833992455049216 

OpenBazaar isn’t as sexy as what we are all hoping for- \**[cough eBay cough](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ebay-seriously-considering-accepting-bitcoin-164410989.html)*\* but it would be good continued adoption nonetheless.


* Finally, the “One huge unexpected surprise:”  I don’t know, maybe coblee is pregnant? 

I’m torn on this. My instincts are always to be cautious when something is hyped up as “huge,” especially after this last year in crypto. I can’t remember a single “Huge upcoming announcement” that lived up to the hype. (ex Neo, Monero, Einsteinium, etc. etc.) Monero in particular [was a speculator trap](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/7merre/upcoming_announcement_predictions_a_realistic/drtpgqo/), which I see more coblee’s speed rather than hyping up fluff. On the other hand, I feel like Charlie and co know this too, so maybe it really is a huge announcement. If you follow him closely, you could definitely see a potential take away that this announcement is why he sold his coins in the first place. The sale was definitely a calculated decision, and it wasn't unilateral either: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/945891046751215616 If you read between the lines, he is acutely aware that he has “insider info” and does not want to be accused of using it to his advantage. Take a peek at his recently liked tweets: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/likes His last two as of writing this are these: https://twitter.com/keithnesbit/status/945896336234242048
https://twitter.com/bitcnic/status/945883674301616128

One is a speculator selling on Charlie’s announcement. The other is directly talking about insider hype and the personal enrichment that comes with that. There are other examples of Charlie encouraging speculators to sell: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/945408382818590720 

I am willing to bet some LTC that if Charlie has actual hype news to back up the “huge surprise” claim, the idea of quick-buck bandwagoners and traders who don’t care about Litecoin’s mission or purpose selling now and missing out on the surge would be the cherry on top for Charlie. I could see that being an added bonus to his warning tweet a few weeks ago, too. I believe that he wants people to own Litecoin because they believe in the vision of decentralized, permissionless, uncensorable money, not because “their moon” is $1000 bucks or all the BS posts I see in this sub these days.

Or maybe I’m projecting this last part on him because that is what I want. Sure, it’s nice that the price of each Litecoin has jumped considerably, but there is something greater taking place right now than personal enrichment. Litecoin has value because the people agree that it does, and the technology allows us to agree without being told by a higher power. I like Charlie, but he is not the reason I hold Litecoin. I hold Litecoin because through ups and downs and 6 years of existence, the technology has been proven and people around the world understand and agree that this blockchain has value. And it’s only a matter of time until the big announcements come- signaling real adoption.

"https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc

I saw this FUD article recently, and I figure I should refute it before it gets spread as truth. I've already seen many people say that it proves something. SMH

> Problem 1: Charlie Lee was an employee of Coinbase when Coinbase added Litecoin, a crypto-currency he ‘created’ by simply copying Bitcoin and changing the name and adjusting a few variables and a hash function taken ‘scrypt’ from another crypto-currency.

Writing the initial code for Litecoin was easy. Doing it as fair as possible was the key. Fending off attacks and building the community from ground up was the hard part.

> Problem 2: Charlie Lee likely had significant holdings of Litecoin while he worked for Coinbase, and therefore may have asked many times for Coinbase to add Litecoin. Being an engineer at Coinbase, he may also be responsible for implementing the code to add Litecoin to Coinbase.

I joined Coinbase in 2013 as the 2nd engineer and helped build Coinbase to become what it is today. I didn't just join them last year, get them to add Litecoin, and quit! I took 3 years before I felt like it made sense business-wise to add Litecoin to Coinbase. I pitched the idea to add ETH and LTC at the same time, but Brian and Fred decided to add ETH first. When it made sense, LTC was added to GDAX because LTC was the top-3 trading volume of any coins at that time. And when GDAX started doing huge volume for LTC, I asked Brian if it made sense for Coinbase to add LTC in that tweet. He said yes, and that was when the decision was made.

> Charlie Lee kept promising Coinbase will add Litecoin on the Litecoin Telegram.

My post to telegram was after Brian announced on Twitter. So I did not leak any the news that Coinbase will add Litecoin. (check the dates: 4/5 versus 4/12)

> Problem 3: The Litecoin community was essentially dead prior to being listed on Coinbase, on reddit. The only people who wanted Litecoin listed, were people hodling their Litecoins, and presumably, Charlie Lee.

This is conjecture. The community was not dead. Sure it's less people posting on reddit back then, but reddit is not the whole community. LTC was actively traded and that's the reason why Coinbase added Litecoin.

> Problem 4: Nobody was using Litecoin!

Also conjecture. What mattered to Coinbase was trade volume and LTC was top 3.

> Problem 5: Irregular trading activity prior to Litecoin announcements.

I don't see what was irregular. LTC was traded pretty crazily around that time because of SegWit and Coinbase adding news.

> Problem 6: Charlie Lee quit working for Coinbase almost immediately after Litecoin was added, to ‘focus’ on Litecoin.

I was already doing part time in 2016 summer and spending more than half my time with Litecoin and adding SegWit. You would know if you were around back then. I told Coinbase late 2016 that I would leave sometime in 2017. The whole company knew already months before the decision was made to add Litecoin. So it was not like Coinbase adds Litecoin and then I immediately quit. If Coinbase decided not to add Litecoin, I would have left anyways. I was already spending most of my time on Litecoin.

In summary, Coinbase adding Litecoin is due to Litecoin having large trading volume and a good business decision. And I did not trade LTC with insider news. Coinbase is highly regulated. If there's any shenanigans, Coinbase and I would easily be in big trouble.

"I get it, most people on this thread who have been in crypto for years and thoroughly understand the technology also understand how to move coins to a hardware wallet, software wallet, or paper wallet. 

On the other hand, many newbies keep their coins on an exchange because it’s easy, intuitive, and straightforward. 

The most frustrating thing in crypto communities is that it’s preached that if you leave your coins on an exchange you’re doomed. But I find so many flaws in that. Here we go:

1. Just as there are horror stories about leaving your coins on exchange (like the Mt. Gox fiasco), there are also horror stories of people losing flash drives that contained hundreds of coins that people put on the USB in the plans to HODL for the long haul. At least if your coins are on an exchange, you have some chance for reparations from the exchange. If you lost your flash drive, on the other hand, you’re screwed. 
2. Exchanges are advancing. Coinbase is becoming the figurehead for crypto exchanges, largely because of the ease of access and accessibility for beginners. Their fees are higher which sucks, but it also means they’re profiting more money than other exchanges and thus have the means to continue to increase their site’s bandwidth, speed, and security. Other exchanges look janky, like my 7th grade web development project, and I wouldn’t trust them with my money. Coinbase, however, is aiming to become the gold standard. When you look at robo-investing platforms like Acorns, Betterment, etc., those are all budding tech companies where beginner investors park their money and trust it for the long haul. For me, Coinbase is no different. Sure, any one of these platforms could be hacked. Equifax was hacked for goodness sakes. There’s no guarantee your assets will be safe, but there’s also no guarantee they won’t be. I’d rather take the route then that’s at least simple and mitigates user error. Which leads me to #3.
3. There are sooo many ways you could screw yourself over by moving your coins off an exchange. Beyond losing your flash drive, you could lose your paper wallet or it could be lost in a fire. Want to put your flash drive in a safety deposit box? Fair. But SDB’s have been burglarized before at banks, banks can be victim to the same acts of God (fire, hurricane, earthquake, etc).
4. Not having your coins on an exchange means not having them at a moment’s notice if you really were to need them. Life comes at you fast. You could be on vacation in California and chop your arm off in a jet ski accident and suddenly need funds to pay ambulatory and hospital fees. Meanwhile, your little flash drive is back in North Dakota. (Yes, I know this is a dramatic scenario, but the point still holds.)
5. TECHNOLOGY CAN FAIL. Flash drives can break or defect. Hard drives can break. Just like exchanges themselves can be susceptible to malware and hacks, technology in general is subject to obsolescence. 
6. What if the price started to dip suddenly? With no stop losses or coins on exchanges you don’t have liquidity. So if the price of a coin starts to plummet while you’re on that lovely California vacation, your coins will be deteriorating back in North Dakota. (Once again, the counter argument may be “well, I’m hodling for the long run anyways.” But crypto is still in its infancy and one coin could easily fail to make room for another. No coin, like any asset or investment, is guaranteed to rebound after a dip. We can just reason and hope for a rebound based on market trends.)
7. “But I don’t view LTC/any other coin as an investment like these noobs and grandmas do. I’m hodling till it becomes the currency of the future.” Okay bro, that’s valid. But please see numbers 1, 3, and 5. 

I’m posting this here because I really enjoy LTC’s community and this sub has been fun and upbeat for the most part, but the fear mongering has got to stop. Logically, there is no one *perfect* way to ensure your coins are safe. It’s legitimately impossible to say with certainty that one method can be deemed plausibly and definitively more secure for an indefinite amount of time than the other. Each method has its pros and cons, and they are all VALID. Instead of pushing this apocalyptic “you have to have a wallet off an exchange” message, let’s talk about how in the case of imminent harm, you’re not gonna be running to be closet to open the safe in your basement and grab a flash drive that you hope you don’t lose as you run from whatever imminent danger to wherever you get to safety. I personally want to keep my coins where I have access to them whenever, WHEREVER,  on any device. 

Perpetuity isn’t guaranteed for ANY method of hodling your coins. We can just hope the method we choose ends up being secure in the long run. So instead of pushing one narrative (and potentially intimidating and isolating crypto newbs), let’s acknowledge that we’re all in this together. Personally, I hope there will be an easier and less flawed method for holding coins as crypto becomes more mainstream. But no matter what, I’m gonna do what works for me and you do whatever works for you. Let’s preach that method, support each other and wish for the best, and focus on taking this to the moon instead.

"So that means within the course of roughly 48 hours I lost nearly $4000. That might be the most money I've lost in that amount of time.

In 2014 I bought a bitcoin for $500 and then it dipped to $200-300 for a few years until 2017.

4) **Facts about Litecoin**

Litecoin is the most secure network with Bitcoin, it has the second biggest network hashrate.


It has the third biggest trading volume ( around 6B$ per month ) compaired with ETH and BTC at around 35B$.


The first block was mined 2011-10-08, so its the second oldest coin within the TOP coins and the oldest coin that didnt forked. :) 

The blocktime is 2m 5s, what is around 4times faster then BTC

Fun fact: LTC still can handle more transactions then the forked 8MB Bitcoincash per second, buy only useing a 1MB block.  

It has 45.000 r/litecoin subs, what makes it the 3rd biggest community. 

It has around 1000 tx per hour compaired with 10000 BTC / 12000ETH / 200 DASH / 130 XMR

Transaction volume last 24hours: 30,930,705 LTC = ($1,486,365,727 USD) 

Transaction volume last 24hours:  2,507,343 BTC = ($8,303,929,297 USD) 

Transaction volume last 24hours:    442,464 DASH= (   $86,797,143 USD) 


and so on.

what all Cryptos are planed to be, we should not work against each other we should help us all.

"As much as I would like to sell all my worldly belongings and put every dime I have into litecoin holdings, I have to be an adult and take care of my family.

"Charlie sold off his LTC and DONATED all of his earnings from it. He does not need LTC for financial success. He's been very financially successful regardless of his stake in LTC. He bought into BTC when it was $30/coin and he's been working as a software engineer for a decade and a half in high-profile positions, likely earning well into the 6-figures every year since his early to mid-20s. 

He DOES NOT need LTC for financial success. He could quit working on LTC tomorrow and never have to work another day in his life, and yet he chooses to completely focus his time and energy on the development of LTC. 

He didn't even have to announce that he was selling off his LTC, he did it because he wanted the community to understand he doesn't want there to be a perception of a conflict of interest anymore. It's probably quite stressful and emotionally draining knowing that anything you say will be met with a flurry of opinion since he has a perceived large stake in the product he's endorsing. This is completely counter-productive to his work on LTC.

People are arguing he did it because he's anticipating a bear market in the near-future and that he's capitalizing on LTC's surge for profit. Again, he DONATED all of his earnings from the LTC sell-off. 

What he did was extremely noble. He's invested into LTC more than anyone of us. This is his legacy, which in my eyes, is much more important than financial success (not that he even needs LTC for financial success anyway). If anything, this will give Charlie more freedom to work on LTC without the emotional drain of the community's constant backlash whenever he says or does anything. 

This is extremely refreshing to see in the crypto-community, especially one that's so fueled with greed and manipulation. I applaud Charlie and I'm as confident as ever in LTC's future success.

Edit: I'm not sure if Charlie donated ALL of his earnings from LTC (although he certaintly isn't required to do so and my argument wouldn't change in the slightest if he didn't), but he 100% did donate a portion of it. Again, I'm unsure and apologize for the potential mistake. I also really appreciate the gold, my first in 3 years! Thank you.

"Cryptocurrency will get you feeling emotional if you react too quickly when it falls. This is not a pyramid scheme. There is a real technology behind LTC and BTC.

The technology is still so mis-understood that it makes me cringe listening to some random dude try to give me his 2 cents on how this is all going to collapse. 

Also, I hear about banks talking bad about cryptocurrency. Well, they really should be. Cryptocurrency is going to completely change banking. Cryptocurrency is probably a banks greatest threat. Some banks understand this and have already started to adjust and make room for cryptocurrency. I could go into detail on this subject but let me just say that as cryptocurrency continues to creep in, people will start to use it for transactions to a much larger degree. 

Did you know that Amazon has bought URLs like amazonbitcoin.com and amazonethereum.com? Click those links and see where they take you. Don't sell your LTC. Buy more and hold it. Sorry I did not say Hodl. You can make some money off of day trading but the real money is going to be those who wait. 

Sorry about my rant"

"I've been in the crypto game for almost two years now and I've been browsing these reddits for a while but never made a post. I think now is such a crucial point in our future and I just wanted to share a few thoughts. (Sorry for format, I don't post a lot and I'm on mobile)

1. It's the beginning of a new year and from what I can tell the market usually suffers around this time before ramping up and going full steam ahead, if you  bought within the last month you might be at a loss for most crytpos, litecoin included but the only way you guarantee your loss is if you sell. I learned the hard way and panic sold ethereum last year when it dropped from near 400 to 200ish, if I kept those 20 eth now I'd be able to pay off student debt. Similar mistakes were made with the bitcoin I bought at 500-600...

2. I bought the bulk of my litecoin at $25-35 and more at all increments up to 350. I believe in this coin long term, and tucked away a decent amount into my ledger and plan to hodl for at least a couple years. Right now the entire market is down, not just litecoin (total market cap was at 850b at one point a couple weeks ago and almost went as low as 500b today). Realistically, litecoin is doing very well in comparison rarely dipping below 200 and not staying there for too long. If you bought at 250+ You might feel worried but again you're only going to lose if you sell now. Don't be like me, Still looking back cursing my self for missing out on thousands of dollars. 

3. A lot of the hype that was propelling litecoin a couple months ago, IMO, was based on it being a top 5 coin. Since we lost our spot to cardano, our momentum simmered a bit. Right now should be seen as an oppertunity to reclaim our spot in the top 5. If litecoin can make it past 300 quicker than cardoano can recover, we will top their market cap. Of course this is all speculative and would need a lot of effort on the litecoin communities part. 

4. 2018 has just started and there's still plenty of great things coming for litecoin. Some people aren't happy with Charlie Lee and I can understand why, but he's still a good leader and is putting in more work and effort than a lot of these other crytpos. If you have faith in the project than just relax, sit back and let your money work for you. As you've heard many times before, don't invest money you aren't comfortable losing. 

Sorry for the long post, Hope it made sense. Thanks for reading ! May the hodl be strong with all of you. 

Edit: Wanted to add that I am in no way an expert on crypto or have any prior investing experience, I've simply been following it for a little while now and spend about 20% of my day researching all the coins im invested in. "
"Every other submission to this sub is someone asking when is the best time to buy or when everyone expects a dip to come.. well I have a spoiler for those people, no one knows the answers to those questions!! It's kinda a bit stupid to ask even, if anyone really think they are going to get a reasonable answer and then act on it with their money, they should probably not be investing in cryptos in the first place.

The only advice you can reasonably trust is your own judgement and also follow the tried and true method of only investing as much money as you are comfort losing, in the worst case scenario.

Also:

* Don't leave huge amounts of coins/money on exchanges

* Your coins are only truely safe if they are in your wallet and you control the keys.

* Try to average out your investments over time so that your average price is evened out on multiple purchase of coins (Dollar cost averaging).


Also please remember this is a LTC sub, so chances are 95% of people here are positive and hopeful for LTC, so don't be surprised if you get a very one sided, optimistic view on litecoins future.

Take care with your money and invest sensibly!"
"Hello guys, let me introduce myself as a Litecoin enthusiast.
I did read a lot of texts here in Litecoin reddit but this is my first writing.

The reasons why I like Litecoin are 1. the vision of Charlie Lee 2. Litecoin team 3. consensus of Litecoin community 4. practicality(the Cryptocurrency for payments) 5. Long history in Cryptocurrency field and etc.

I saw a lot of people blaming the price of Litecoin. I hope you guys do something for LTC before blaming Litecoin.

I'm bit famous on Korean Cryptocurrency community as an anonymous.(I wrote useful information of coins in Korean language as an anonymous writer.)
As you all know cryptocurrency is being famous day by day. Many Koreans have been investing their money on this market. I meet various types of people(government employee, bank employee, engineer and more) because of my job(businessman).
Whenever I meet people, the people asking me about Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bcash. The questions are like this, ""Is it safe to invest my money on cryptocurrency?"" ""Is the Bcash next level of Bitcoin?"" ""Bgold is something better than Litecoin?""

Before I think that they are poorly stupid below the surface. But recently, I realized that not all the people are techie like us.
I started to explain the superiority of Litecoin when someone asking me about the cryptocurrency market. 

In reality, I changed the investment of my business partners on Bcash to Litecoin. I didn't say to them, ""Buy Litecoin, it will make you rich"". Because I'm not the type of person that care about the LTC price pumping. I only said the facts, technology, vision of Litecoin. But they changes their mind.
Moreover, I started to recommend Litecoin as a payment system to the ministry of governments, franchise restaurants, companies.

Before 6 months ago, the response of them was laugh. 
But now they are asking me about Litecoin. They say ""We're considering adopt cryptocurrency payments"".

Within just 6 months, estimation on cryptocurrency is changed dramatically here in Korea.
I attended a seminar from Bithumb as a participant yesterday, I was really shocked... The seats were overbooked. The age group of people on seminar is 20 to 80... wow... Time flies really fast thesedays especially on crypto market.

In Korea, because of the massive media exposure on yesterday(Bithumb seminar, Bitcoin news, Litecoin news, Ethereum news),
The price of Litecoin already passed 100$.(https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets) Let's follow the price of ours, Litecoin Hodlers. 

I hope you do something(adopt LTC as payment of your business, spread the correct info & superiority of LTC, translate LTC info on your language, support Charlie and Litecoin team) for Litecoin.
Buying a car, laptop, shoes with Litecoin is not that far from us. 

p.s. To Litecoin team, I suggest you to put Korean translation on litecoin.org & litecoin.com
22 language support on litecoin.org and 13 Ianguage support on litecoin.com
But there is no Korean language till now. 
I'm willing to help to translate the content on your webpage.
(I already sent mail to your official address.)
Thank you for the dedication on Litecoin. Much respect for Litecoin team."

"Please stop.

Lifesavings. Loans. I even hear people are mortgaging their houses for crypto.

You are not going to get validation on this forum from this except from the like minded.

It is not brave or bold, it is reckless and incredibly risky. You may make it out as some on here have, but this goes against all common investing sense.

Never invest what you cannot afford to lose or are willing to lose.

Take a breath, do your research, and have patience. Not so much Hodl, just firm confidence.

Just please, do not risk your financial well being on this. 

The stress alone will ruin you.

"Recently, Bitcoin Ben hosted a meetup where he talked about various things about the Litecoin Foundation and me that were untrue. I would like to correct it. It is not ok to misrepresent the LF or me.

1) We don't discuss LTC price in our Litecoin Foundation slack channels. We work towards adoption first and foremost. Price will do well if adoption happens, and not the other way around. Ben may have chatted privately with members of the LF and discussed price. Nothing wrong with people predicting prices, but it's not ok to present that as a LF price target.

2) No one knew that the crash this year was going to happen. It wasn't orchestrated as far as I am aware.

3) Ben doesn't know me that well. We haven't really chatted after he joined our slack.

4) I am NOT trying to keep the price low. That would be dumb. It is not OK to misinterpret my tweets and then claim that I told him personally that I'm trying to keep the price down and that I know I can't keep it down anymore.

5) I have nothing to do with OMG or other ICO tokens. I've always tried to keep a distance from ICOs. Using my reputation to pump an ICO token is not cool.

I like that Ben is very passionate about Litecoin and wants to help, but as a representative of the Litecoin Foundation, he shouldn't be making up things or stretching the truth. Ben has since stepped down from volunteering for the foundation."

"Hi old fellas,


The last few weeks have been really brutal to LTC holders. Many people here have bought LTC above 300$ and turning bitter about litecoin.


It's time to realize that you just entered the market at the wrong time and if you haven't bought during these dips and brought down your average cost, well Litecoin's magical bull run is what you wish to occur in near future.


Litepay is something huge and can shoot LTC's market cap to where it belongs, up in the TOP 3. LTC is still one of the easiest crypto get in and with Litepay it will become even easier to use in daily life. There might be new shiny coins entering the market but a Product without Adoption is nothing and Technology without Promotion will never reach to it's deserved value.


Let's help the big news of Litepay reach more and more eyeballs. The big players are doing the part of signing up big merchants, let's contribute our share and help it reach more consumers. The word 'litecoin' seems to be really faded on social media and reddit. Let's not blindly shill people but let's educate the masses and list the benefits of getting in the ship now before adoption really sparkles.


Litecoin will always be close to my heart. I bought some BTC few years ago but it was LTC that reignited my interest in crypto."
"I don't generally post about crypto on Reddit, but I subscribe to and keep tabs on several crypto subs. As I'm sure the veterans of this space have noticed, there has been a pretty massive influx of new blood over the last couple of weeks or so. The proof is in the thread topics and the questions being asked. New people entering the space is fantastic and paves the way for mainstream adoption. Litecoin is rallying for various reasons and it's a great coin with a great community.

With that being said, there will be a downturn/correction/crash/whatever you want to call it soon and many newbies will immediately sell off and go ""I knew it was too good to be true"" or ""siighh..my dad was right, it is a sham""..

DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE NEWBIES. 

Be strong, understand why the peaks and dips happen and at who's expense. The more manic people are when times are good, the more panicky they are when times are not so good.

Be strong and know your limits. I know in your cursory explorations, you've probably seen someone write ""don't buy more than you can afford to lose"" more than once. This is extremely underrated and unfollowed advice. Part of being strong is not just holding during down times, but also not allowing yourself to buy what you can't afford. Not a financial adviser, just offering my opinion.

Be strong and **hold** (I know, but this is serious)

"Two things happened in the past 24 hours and it’s no coincidence that they were so close together:


* Charlie freeing himself from conflicts of interest by selling his LTC 


* Charlie cryptically mentioning a “huge, unexpected surprise” to occur in 2018


So here’s what I think happened. Charlie went to secure a deal with a large company to support LTC. Amazon, let’s presume. Amazon turns around and says, “We’ll adopt LTC as a payment platform but we want it to be drama-free, and the only way to do that is to have you relieve yourself of your investment.” Amazon doesn’t want to be accused of biases.

So Lee sold his share (supposedly...) to exonerate Litecoin and allow it to be ‘free’ in such a way that there are no strings attached. He did this under the conditions that a certain company would adopt it as their official cryptocurrency payment method.

"Electrum-ltc,

Today I found out Two thousand three hundred ninety nine Litecoins were stolen from my wallet on April 12, 2018.

Here is what I did that day:

1- On the morning of April 12, I decided to reset Windows 10 using the recovery option. and wipe out all files, which I had already backed-up on another drive.
2- After installing Windows office, Chrome and Adobe Reader, I then decided to download the Electrum Litecoin wallet from .
3- I downloaded the ""Windows installer"" version, typed in my seed during the setup and next a message indicating an error popped-up. The message said something about not being able to connect to the server.
4- I tried once again and the same thing happened. I quickly goggle for an answer but couldn't find a simple one.
5- I then downloaded the ""Standalone Executable"" version, typed my seed during the setup and the wallet opened. I don't remember checking the balance, but I do remember deciding to give it a few minutes to update. So, I then went to install other wallets and programs, etc. and totally forgot about the wallet.
6- Then, I restarted my computer after some windows updates or something, got carried away with work, and didn't check my Litecoin wallet.
7- Today, April 17, 2018, I decided to check my wallet and I found out my wallet had been emptied.
8- After trying to figure out how I had been hacked I found out that my wallet was emptied seconds after I installed the wallet on April 12. The hack didn't just stop there, my seed was also used to claim and take my Litecoin Cash.

Because the hack happened exactly at the moment of the Electrum Litecoin wallet was installed and seems like it was an automatic process, I suspect the hack came through the wallet downloaded web page electrumltc.org.


New information/ Add 4/24/2018  6:26 pm East time

Through the Bing search, we typed electrum ltc, and the false page appeared. Electrumltc.org

I had the windows wallets from that site analysed by a programmer. We discovered that it sends the seeds 12 words to this address ip 111.90.149.131. I beg the community for any help . We will be very attentive ..
We have been studying how the Litecoins have moved in the Blockchain, and we notice that they were sent to some wallets that, according to Chainz's explorer. belong to Bitfinex and Binance. In the end, the coins arrived to Wallet LTU2cds4aSdXFip9sV4gXphnhxGQjgfjmg.
I would like to ask you from my heart to help from the whole community, to publish this information, in hopes that Binance and Bitfinex, recognize the Litecoins as stolen and take actions. From our wallet the coin passed through their systems. I remember when I started in the world of cryptocurrencies, Bitfinex was hacked for an amount of 60million dollars equivalent in Bitcoin, at that moment ...time flies.
We are following the Litecoin and organizing all the information to let the cryptocurrency community know about the stolen 2,449 LTC (first 2,399 LTC and then 50 LTC).

In the following direction, a whole discussion on the subject was started ... and there are images related to the theft:

If youre still alive that is
"Ok first let's confirm I know how Litepay will work. So let's pretend I have 22 LTC worth $5000 USD. 

Now let's say I go to a retail store and am looking to buy a smartphone. As I stand there I see the price is 2 LTC, which converts to $500 USD.

So I'm talking to the salesperson, walking around, and by the time I get back to to the phone to purchase the value of LTC has taken a hit. A small dip, so now the price is 2.1 LTC so that the merchant is still getting $500 and I'm still paying $500....sorta.

The phone was always $500 USD, but now I have slightly less LTC in my account because of the purchase. Sadly LTC continues to drop and within a few days, subtracting the $500 USD purchase, my total amount of LTC coin obviously remains the same but my USD buying power has dropped to $4200. 

The same smartphone on that day is 2.9 LTC.

So the only thing that is really smart for me to do is HODL, don't spend until LTC value goes up and I ""recoup"" my $300 in USD value.

Now let's say the opposite happens. LTC market does well and my initial 22 LTC has a USD worth of $5500. The smartphone is 1.8 LTC, the merchant gets the same instant conversion to $500 USD, and I got a phone for less LTC so I feel like I made out pretty good.

So if this is how LitePay works I still don't understand why a consumer would ever deal with it. If LTC is going down then I will won't to HODL my coins. If LTC appears to be trending upwards then I will also want to.....HODL my coins. 

I would only ever want to spend my LTC at a store if I was 100% certain the value would increase no? If I knew 2 LTC would be worth $550 tomorrow then I would buy the smartphone today when 2 LTC is worth $500. 

None of this effects the merchant because they get instant USD conversion. But for me the consumer I would 2nd guess and triple guess myself before any purchase.

How in the world would this ever catch on?"
"Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

"###Welcome to /r/Litecoin!

Whether you're new to cryptocurrency and have no clue what a 'litecoin' is, or a seasoned investor in cryptocurrencies, the resources below will answer all your questions. If you still have questions, feel free to ask below in the comments!

&nbsp;

##What is Litecoin?

Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin is one of the largest, oldest, and most used cryptocurrencies in the world. Similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin uses blockchain technology to process transactions.

So what's the difference? To process a block, Litecoin takes 2.5 minutes rather than Bitcoins 10 minutes. This allows for faster processing times. Litecoin also has the capability to produce a total of 84 million units, compared to Bitcoins 21 million. In addition, Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm, a sequential memory-hard function requiring asymptotically more memory than an algorithm which is not memory-hard.

Still confused? Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7B7S88RtV8)!

&nbsp;

##Where can I buy Litecoin?

There are many websites and applications where you can buy and sell Litecoin, but make sure the exchange you are using is trusted and secure. Here are some exchanges that are trusted in the cryptocurrency community:

Exchange|
:--|:--
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)|
[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)|
[247Exchange](https://www.247exchange.com/)|
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)|
[Quadrigacx](https://www.quadrigacx.com)|

&nbsp;

##Where can I securely store Litecoin?

Litecoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is stored in a digital wallet. When storing Litecoin, you want to make sure you trust the place you store them. This is why it is best to store them yourself through the [electrum wallet](https://electrum-ltc.org/). It is highly suggested to not store your Litecoin in an exchange (such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc.) because you don't control the private keys. If the exchange ever goes offline, or becomes insolvent, your Litecoin essentially disappear.

Some other options are:

Wallet|
:--|:--
[Electrum Lightweight Wallet](https://electrum-ltc.org/)|
[Official Core Wallet](https://litecoin.org/#download)|
[LiteVault Secure Web Wallet](https://www.litevault.net/)|
[Paper Wallet Generator](https://liteaddress.org/)|

&nbsp;

If you're a fan of mobile devices, then Loafwallet is the wallet for you. Developed by a Litecoin community member, /u/losh11, this mobile wallet works great!

&nbsp;

Hardware wallets are another great option, in fact, they are said to be the most secure way to store cryptocurrencies. Below is a list of the litecoin flexible hardware wallets.

"We have a great opportunity to be the premier coin in Japan! And possibly even Korea. 

They’ve both been opening up more and more exchanges and we’re seeing more adoption from these countries. This opportunity is HUGE

If we can spread Litecoin’s vision and it’s name across these countries as investors are first starting out, we can gain a ridiculous amount of momentum that will trebuchet us pass the moon and into the  stars ✨ 

If we have any dedicated Korean and Japanese speakers on this sub we need you to go to their respective discussion boards and spread the word for us :) grass roots it in a way 

Don’t be too pushy or too shilly, but speak with passion and show them with hard facts why Litecoin is the crypto to put your hopes on,

Edit: /u/jrockvskpop : “The four companies approved in this round are recently established exchanges: Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange Co. Ltd, Bit Arg Exchange Tokyo Co. Ltd, FTT Corporation, and Xtheta Corporation.”

TL;DR: We need our Korean and Japanese /r/litecoin peeps to go spread the word on why Litecoin should be #1"
"Lowest so far? can anyone confirm? loaf wallet is still at .001. That's an entire decimal point difference!

Zap dropped word of a WordPress plugin for the woocommerce platform.  WordPress is used by like 20% of the internet.  Woocommerce runs the majority of the eccomerce sites that use WordPress.   If this plugin drops that means tons of eccomerce stores could immediately begin accepting LTC.   This could be big big big!  Thoughts?  I've got like 40+ clients that could jump on this immediately when it drops.  This will making purchases using crypto (especially LTC) even more mainstream!

"Litecoin is truly evolving into what cryptocurrencies are supposed to be, practical and usable. All the arguing between coins saying they have this that or the other doesn't matter. When it boils down, Litecoin is the only practical coin to use right now for transactions of any type."
"I'm so stoked to see your coin on an indepent bull run! 

I don't have any my self atm, but us here in crypto should be at each others throats a bit less and happy to see others succeed, after all, things like this add legitimacy to the world we populate, and even if the price of a coin doesn't affect me directly it helps my coins indirectly. 

Enjoy the run friends, I'm here on the sidelines cheering you on!"
"I was fired in 2013 from a tech startup I co-founded.  That hurt.  It took months before landing another job and getting back on my feet.  During my unemployment, I mined a few litecoins and noticed a problem:  I had too many wallets scattered.  Half a coin in one wallet, some fraction in another, maybe a whole one here or there. Checking my total balance was bothersome.

&nbsp;


Every app was either a wallet, or exchange.  None aggregated your dispersed litecoins into a single balance.  So I built myself a quick Android app and kept it minimal.  I published it for free, posted it to this subreddit, and moved on.

&nbsp;


Last month, Litecoin received big attention.  I decided to check my old wallets and found a few coins here, a few fractions there.  Nothing too exciting.  But one of my paper wallets didn't have a total written on it; it just said donations.  Donations? From what?

&nbsp;


I keyed in the address and saw over **400 LTC** resting.  It didn't make sense.  After investigating, I found that people have been donating to my old Litecoin Balance app for some time.  I teared up.

&nbsp;


I am moved.  But I feel guilty for not improving the app all this time.  I read a few suggestions and comments, sure.  But I honestly didn't know you cared that much.  I knew it solved an obvious problem, and that it did so in a simple, painless way, but shit! 

&nbsp;


I now have a great UI/UX guy on board, and we put together a new iOS version, and will be improving it to your needs.  We also updated the Android app as well--because it really needed a facelift.

&nbsp;


I am 100% on the Litecoin train now.  I am running a full node.  Hell, I bought a t-shirt.  Because of you, I can afford to pay off my student loan debt and a bit of my mortgage debt.  You made a painful time in my life worth all the while.  Even when we are on the moon, I will continue to create free, open software for Litecoin and you.  Just tell me when I screw up.

&nbsp;


About the app:

It's called Litecoin Balance

Free.

No adds.

No account creation.

No crazy app permission requests.

Data storage on your local device ONLY.

(We do not store your data.  We are not interested in what you do with this app data-wise, but only that you like it.)

&nbsp;


**TL;DR I found over 400 LTC sitting in a wallet I forgot about.  And I love you.  Also, app now available on iOS.**

Congrats that you have X amount of LTC/BTC/XPR/or Prussian francs... I think you honestly should be proud, because you have lined yourself up to make a sizable amount of cash over the next couple of years. You're smart. However, telling anyone that you have anything just makes you a target.

"When NASA was building rockets to go to the moon, do you think the press asked them about each and every bolt that they put on launch platform? No they did not!  Do you think NASA took calls from every curious teenager to answer questions about radiation shielding or propellant systems? Heck no! 

For the most part, people realized that it would take a small miracle get everything off the ground. And they knew that the engineers were doing the best that they could. People were excited to go to the moon but they were not impatient because they knew it was going to be a monumental challenge. And even if the engineers involved wanted to give minute by minute updates to the local fan club, they were too busy to do so.

If you want LTC to go to the Moon then let our engineers work in peace. Trust that they will let us know whenever they reach a big milestone. And believe that they want this win more than you do, so they're going to be working their very hardest until they achieve it. 

On that note, you should understand that their moon is probably different than yours. They're not looking for a few dollar signs or a lambo, they're looking to disrupt the financial sector with a revolutionary piece of technology. 

So if you want to post memes, then leave the low hanging fruit for the spam coins. Don't post memes about price or launch pads or your boredom. 

Instead post memes about the bad ass engineers who are making this all possible. Post memes about the people who are busting their butts to make digital money a reality. Honor the people who have decided to wage war on the financial sector with a keyboard and a blockchain. 

These folks are our champions and you should show them some respect because they've damn well earned it!"
"someone wants the price to go up, someone else wants the price to go down. Both sides want to own vast amounts of LTC The one who is making it go up has the majority of LTC and wants it to go up now, the one who is making it go down has vast amounts of USD and wants it to go down to shake out the weak hands and rebuy everything. Edit: The problem is, the vast USD holder doesn't infinite LTC to sell down, and the vast LTC holder doesnt have infinite amounts of USD to price up. The defintion of a costly war, and all you see is the price at 276-283.

This means you must HODL because you make it easier for the price to go up and thus harder to make it go down, and at the same time, you make the pumper easier to attract more interest. Either way, just HODL and give it time. It's not a correction, it's a war on every coin at this very moment. Correction was this morning, this is now war for control.

"Alright redditors,

We can all sit here and shitpost or eat tons of mayo but if we make high quality shitpost we might actually help the cause.

What am I talking about? We're having a huge opportunity handed to us. Let's go over the facts.

1) There is a massive influx underway of new users.
https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/7ggmid/coinbase_we_are_experiencing_all_time_high/
https://twitter.com/ramikawach/status/936125519820492800


2) These are not yet all integrated into the ecosystem but yesterday we saw a preview of what this means during rising prices for the networks. ETH, BTC and LTC all set new record for transaction numbers. 
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-ltc.html#log#3m


3) For bitcoin this 400k transactions a day is known to be an absolute max under its current form. All blocks are full and the miners saw huge growth in the last weeks leading to an unprecedented amount of blocks mined in one day. (173 vs the hardcoded 144 (under no miner growth))


4) Ethereum saw 663k txs yesterday and 637k as an average over the last three days. It is my belief it can currently handle up to 900k, and will see mempool bloating and the rising of the fees before that.

Calculations for the 900k:

Average gas limit per block is 6,715,000: https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit

Average blocks per day: 6350 https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime (need a zoom for this one) (block every 13,6 seconds)

This leads to a gas limit of 42,640,000,000 per day.

The past three days we saw on average 30,000,000,000 gas spent. https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused

This means we were at 70,35% capacity over the past three days where 637k/day were transacted. 

This leaves me to believe ethereum has a total capacity of 905k/day.


5) Litecoin has exactly 4 times the capacity of bitcoin. This means it can deal with 1 million transactions per day without bloating the mempool and with 1,5 million when the mempool is fully bloated and transaction fees have risen to 1 or several dollars.


6) Bitcoin Cash is not traded on Bitstamp nor GDAX (2 of the top 10 exchanges) and is not well viewed in the core camp. It also did not see anywhere near a new ATH in terms of transactions yesterday.


7) This is exactly Charlie's vision. To use Litecoin for many smaller transaction. To have users make the shift from 100% bitcoin to  80% bitcoin / 20% litecoin. And it might happen as soon as next week. If the influx of new people is real and the ether limit of 900k proves right, there will be an unprecedented demand for transactions compounded by a decrease in output of the bitcoin network after its difficulty increase and there will be only 1 network that has both the capacity and availability on every major exchange. Litecoin.


So my proposal is to keep spreading this info, make it into reality. Showcase how great LTC functions as a payment network. I'm sure if litecoin surpasses bitcoin in number of transactions, the price will also do good things."
"

Everyone is so focused on the price right now. Makes sense. But it hides a lot of what a crypto actually is. Here are some stats on LTC you might've missed in the recent chaos:


==Transactions==

Litecoin has peaked at 68k daily transactions! Bitcoin these days processes 443k, and Ethereum 791k. We still have lots of room to spare!
This is far more than the next runners-up, Dash and BCash, at 15k and 27k respectively.

Since November 1st, Litecoin daily transactions have increased by 189%! Among the aforementioned coins,
the next runner-up is Dash with a 140% increase. Then Ethereum at 51%, Bitcoin at 30%, and 
finally BCash at -79%. Outch!


==Daily Tweets==

Litecoin today is tweeted about roughly 7k times. Bitcoin 155k, Ethereum 18k, and Dash 1k. You might think
the LTC/BTC ratio would be 0.045 because of that, but you would be wrong! Ha ha ha. Anyway, since November 1st
our chikun coin has gained an amazing 217% Twitter activity! Next was Bitcoin at 172%, Ethereum at 84%, and finally
Dash at 34%. Try harder, Dash! Just kidding you weird little bastard.


==Daily Active Addresses==

Bitcoin is king with an incredible 871k active addresses. Next up is Ethereum with 406k, then our silver coin
(or is that another altcoin? I lose track) with 174k. On the next tier are Dash and BCash with, respectively, 
56k and 55k. 

Compared with November 1st we have gained 141% daily active addresses which is more than Ethereum at 62%, 
BCash at 30%, and Bitcoin at only 11%. Dash came in close to us with a 115% increase. Good job, Dash!



So there you have it. Some stats that matter showing us closer to Bitcoin in many ways that aren't fiat value. For all three of the above
measures Litecoin has experienced the highest growth since November 1 compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and BCash. I hope this helps
to put Litecoin's growth into some perspective. And this is without widespread use of MAST, RSK, or atomic swaps! The future is bright, even if the ratio is not.


Cheers all!

"I want to clarify some things about recent events.

First of all, please note that there is a difference between Litecoin and the Litecoin Foundation. Litecoin is a decentralized network and currency. Litecoin Foundation (LF) is a centralized non-profit organization whose mission is to advance Litecoin development, adoption, and usage. I am the creator of Litecoin and the Managing Director of the LF. I know this causes quite a bit of confusion, but hopefully I can set the record straight. Litecoin doesn’t need LF or me for that matter, but I’m working hard with LF to make Litecoin a success. If LF is not doing a good job, nothing prevents another organization to step up and do better. This exact situation actually happened last year when the LF came into existence because the Litecoin Association wasn’t doing a good job. When you invest in Litecoin by buying LTC, money doesn’t go to fund LF in any way. In some ways, LF is working for you for free to help increase the value of your investment. Of course, we appreciate all the people who have donated to LF and those donations go a long way to further our success.

Last week, LF announced a partnership with TokenPay Swiss AG (TP) in a deal to acquire a stake in a German bank, WEG Bank AG. This partnership is between LF and TP. The deal is that LF receives the 9.9% stake in the bank in exchange for technical work and marketing support for TokenPay, eFin decentralized exchange, and integration with the bank. To be clear, LF did not pay any money for this stake in the bank. The plan is also for me to get a board seat at the bank.

There was a TPAY token sale last December. If you have been following me on Twitter, you know that I don’t like tokensales/ICOs. I don’t like ICOs because some of them are outright scams and most of them are set up to fail because of bad incentive structures. That said, TP did not run away with the their funds. Instead, they have used those funds exactly as they promised, and buying the bank is part of that promise. Further, through my interaction with Derek Capo, TP CEO, I have seen sincerity and real desire to increase crypto adoption. Given all that, I feel comfortable representing LF in making this deal with TP.

I want to now lay out the possibilities of this partnership, best case and worst case. 

Best case is that with this bank, we are able to create and deliver crypto solutions like debit cards, merchant processing, and other innovative solutions. However, even with a stake and influence at the bank, it’s not guaranteed that this will succeed. People have brought up valid concerns that we still need to work with and be approved by players in the current financial systems like Visa and SWIFT, but we definitely have a much higher chance of succeeding now that we own a stake in a bank with bank licenses. And with a seat at the board of the bank, I will have some influence on the direction. Even if we are not able to do anything with this bank in terms of pushing crypto adoption further, we still have a stake in the bank and can benefit financially from it, which benefits LF and its mission. Worst case is of course that the partnership fails for whatever reasons. This would of course hurt LF’s reputation, but it would have no material impact on LF and, of course, it would have no effect on the Litecoin network and currency. Just like Bitcoin is not affected by Bitcoin Foundation’s failures, Litecoin is not affected by Litecoin Foundation’s failures. Of course reputation is important to people’s confidence in Litecoin Foundation and Litecoin and we understand that, but nothing successful ever happens without taking some risks. In this case, we believe that the potential gains far outweigh the risks.

If you have any further questions, please ask me and I will try to answer.

P.S. For transparency, neither the LF nor I have ever owned or plan to own any TPAY coins."

"Reptiles N Reefs Las Vegas is now accepting BTC and LTC just in time for Black Friday!

Thanks to this sub for teaching me how to set it up! GO LTC! Wohooooo!"
You know which one I'm talking about. No rollocosters.
"I see a lot of articles posted online about the carbon footprint bitcoin/litecoin mining has recently. Eg: http://pando.com/2013/12/16/bitcoin-has-a-dark-side-its-carbon-footprint/

I found out about American Forests a year or 2 ago when I saw them being used in a couple of PR campaigns from Ikea/we-wood etc. 

Basically the deal is if you donate $1 to them they grow a tree on your behalf since in bulk the saplings are pretty cheap. So if a company donates $10k they can proudly write we grew 10,000 trees to fight out carbon footprint like idea/we-wood does. More: http://www.americanforests.org/

I talked to Greg Meyer from American Forests gmeyer-AT-americanforests.org http://www.americanforests.org/who-we-are-about-us/senior-staff-bios/ a couple of times last year and tried convincing my company to donate $10k to them.  

While I could not convince the company I work with to donate them $10k to grow 10,000 trees it would still be amazing if we could raise $10k in litecoin and grow 10,000 trees with that. I really respect what they do and global warming is a real thing. 

That ways we would be able to fight the carbon footprint bitcoin/litecoin mining has and additionally get litecoin the Positive PR we need. 

__________________________

**Update:** /user/Backpack_Stargazer linked to http://www.treesforthefuture.org/ which plants trees at $0.10 a pop. Thus with $10k we would be able to plant 100,000 trees. 100k trees would also sound a LOT better in a Press release and do a lot of good for this world. 

We just need somebody respected in the community to setup a wallet to accept donations which can go to the organization of choice on our behalf. I'm pretty sure now that a LOT of people are wiling to support something like this if the right member steps up and creates a wallet. 

__________________________

**Update:** I'm talking to /user/Cmannoia to get a fundraiser started. He/She claims to work with http://www.edenprojects.org/ and has posted a payment address on the website to verify https://edenreforestationprojects.nationbuilder.com/donate . I've asked them to create a new thread for the fundraiser along with some verification (100,000 trees AND creating jobs in africa!). They would be accepting litecoins directly so that would work out perfectly for everybody. I'll update this once they post the thread. 
__________________________

**Update:**  We finally got the official fundraiser live:  http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1vyuvl/100000_tree_project_fundraiser_wthe_eden_projects/ .. We convinced a charity that grows trees to accept litecoins directly and they are going to grow a 100,000 trees now on our behalf once the fundraiser is complete. 10x of the original goal. Reddit is so awesome! Glad we could get something live! "
"doubling and tripling of market cap can occur. lots of people spreading lies on ltc and fud. That hater stuff is one reason we are going much higher

PS: Charlie just announced lower fees as of 2 ish EST.

PS2: LTC growth is organic and not due to hype/PR, etc as evidenced by the Charlie inteview today. Organic growth is the best and most solid. LTC just works and works CHEAPER just like ETH!

PS3: for the newbies, LTC was created with being 1/4 of btc in mind. Do the math. Can you imagine if LTC went to 4-5k? HODL

"I have been reading a lot of comments and post of people saying, *""When BTC implements Segwit, LTC will be meaningless""* or *""August 1st will be the end of BTC""*. I have to admit, I too got scared a couple months ago during the NYC Consensus back in May when hearing about BTC and Segwit. However, I did my research first before spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). 

#Y2K Bug = August 1st BTC Deadline

First off everyone is spreading FUD about the August 1st deadline and it honestly reminds me of the Y2K Bug. *""Everyone cash out and protect your money""* or *""The market will crash and burn""*. The reason this is not going to happen is because this would mean everyone will just lose faith in cryptocurrency in general. People are spreading FUD all over the internet for one reason only . . . **they want cheap BTC** . Everyone has this idea that BTC will crash and then they can grab cheap BTC under $1000 and then BTC will go up to $10k and they will be rich! Honestly, Segwit is going to get implemented, there will be no hard fork. When the dust settles, the markets will barely move. 

#It is a WIN - WIN for Litecoin

**Scenario #1** - BTC does not implement Segwit on August 1st, there is chaos and panic in the cryptocurrency community. BTC holders jump ship to the next closet and most stable cryptocurrency, which is Litecoin. Litecoin jumps to over $500 dollars and everyone becomes rich. 
**Likelihood of this happening = 10%** - This is the doomsday scenario. It will not happen and everyone needs to take a deep breathe. 

**Scenario #2** - BTC implements Segwit, weak hands will jump ship on Litecoin, Litecoin will lose some value initially but will go back up and keep rising as BTC and LTC will see all time highs they have never reached before. 
**Likelihood of this happening 90%** - This is the most practical scenario. Sorry, millionaires and billionaires will not be made overnight. Don't be one of the weak hands that pull out of Litecoin cause it will easily increase 5 folds before this time next year. 

#Why Segwit on BTC = Best Case Scenario of Litecoin

Segwit on BTC means a **HUGE** price increase for Litecoin. Charlie Lee and the community of Litecoin wants Segwit on BTC. 

*But why? Wouldn't this mean BTC will have the same technology as LTC and LTC will be obsolete and lose it's edge in the game?* **NO!**
-> Don't listen to the FUD, don't listen to the rumors. These are the people who are spreading this FUD:

1. People who don't know what they are talking about; didn't do any research; don't understand what they are investing in or; repeating FUD that they read from some random post naively. 

2. People are want **Cheap Litecoin** because they know the value is going to increase drastically over the next year. These are the same people who are spreading FUD about the August 1st deadline with BTC and want to scoop up cheap BTC. These are not *Whales*, these are **Wannabe Whales**. These are the individuals who want as much value and weight as they can. The fact of the matter is - Whales don't spread FUD, whales move markets and can cause their own FUD. Whales are staying put and waiting for everyone to panic and sell their Litecoin and Bitcoin to scoop more up. Don't be one of these fools that the Whales make their money off of!

#So how is Segwit on BTC good for Litecoin?

Charlie Lee has already expressed how this would be **Huge** for the Litecoin community. It will open so many doors, that are closed right now. Here are my top three but there are tons of more benefits. 

1. Two words **Atomic Swap** - this is the best and newest technology in the cryptocurrency world. It is basically cross blockchain trades *but* without having to use an exchange. This is made possible because Litecoin will be implementing the **Lightning Network** soon. If Bitcoin has Segwit it will allow individuals to swap between Litecoin and Bitcoin almost instantaneously. This means if you are at a store and they only accept Bitcoin but you have Litecoin, you can buy that item using atomic swap. Or Bitcoin takes too long to move from one wallet to another or one exchange to another, you can use atomic swap for this to hold Litecoin. Attached is a link to an article that explains atomic swap and how beneficial it will be if Bitcoin gets Segwit for the Litecoin community. [hyperlink](http://www.coindesk.com/cross-blockchain-trades-lightning-gives-new-life-atomic-swaps/)

2. I know you heard it before **Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin's Gold**. This phrase was actually coined (no pun intended) by the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee. With the Bitcoin community getting it's act together and finally implementing Segwit, there will be a big price increase to Bitcoin. Litecoin will truly become the silver of the cryptocurrency world. When Bitcoin goes up, it brings it's little brother Litecoin with it. Bitcoin at 5k will mean Litecoin over $150-$300. BTC going up to 5k is great if you were in the game for a while and have a huge holding of Bitcoin *But* if you got into the game late, you now have a chance to make a **Huge** profit with Litecoin. 

3. Ready for the two most overly used words in the cryptocurrency community **Bitcoin** and **Scaling**. There is no secret Bitcoin has a scaling issue, Ethereum has a scaling issue, even Litecoin scaling solution isn't perfect. We are all early adopters and we should all believe cryptocurrency can be widely accepted with the mainstream public. If more and more people start using Bitcoin scaling is going to become even more of an issue. This is way Litecoin plays so well with Bitcoin. **Litecoin is basically Bitcoin's scaling solution!** Bitcoin is not meant to be quick and limber. Bitcoin is suppose to the gold of cryptocurrency, meaning it should be slow to move it. You store Bitcoin. Whereas Litecoin is the silver of cryptocurrency meaning you can use it quick and easier, cheap transactions and fast confirmation times. It is a win for business owners accepting Litecoin and a win for the individuals using Litecoin as a payment. 

#Segwit on BTC is amazing for Litecoin!"

"Just as the title states and more than welcome to join the discussion. Earlier today - Charlie Lee tweeted out very crucial information in regards to the crypto world in China. Since then he's deleted the series of tweets due to our own very community who consistently demands answers on a 24hr basis. 

Charlie did not have to be the scapegoat, but people are making him out to be such a bad guy who delivered 'news' that didn't please the community. However, if he tweeted something positive to boost his own coin, people would've cheered. However, he tried to protect the community from insider trading which is what we experienced last week and the community puts the guy on blast. What more do you guys want? 

Do you really believe somebody in his position would risk his entire reputation to spread false information? The crypto community in general act like a bunch of self entitled pricks. It's seriously frustrating to watch thread after thread people complaining about losing anywhere from $10 - $1k. Hello? Did you guys not voluntarily put your OWN money into crypto? Did you expect INSTANT profit from the moment you placed that buy order? 

If the idea of losing money gives you fear and anxiety to the point where a leader tries to help the community in hindsight, maybe you should call it quits, (I know most won't - but you should really consider it). You guys are hurting the community and are not really in it for tech & how it'll shape OUR global future.

It's getting sad and tiresome. 

/rant"
"So there have been a lot of posts recently asking about when ""such and such"" tech will be released so I decided to write this post to keep everyone in the loop.

# List of Litecoin Technology

**1. MAST**

* *What does it do?* It allows more privacy by hiding lumped transactions through a Merkle root.  It also allows for complicated smart contracts.  Smart contracts are currently capable on the LTC blockchain, it just takes up a lot of space.  

* *When will it be released?* Of all the tech, this is the closest to being released.  Perhaps in the next Core release update. (But who knows?)

**2. Lightning Network**

* *What does it do?* Allows instant transactions and reduced fees.

* *When will it be released?* The LN isn't being developed by the Litecoin Foundation specifically.  It is being developed by Lighting Labs.  There is a prototype wallet called ZAP! by jack mallers.   If you're a coder, you can help them test it. That being said, it will take a **significant amount of time** in order for the LN to create a fully functional product.  Perhaps a year to create stable wallets.  Multiple years to scale it out.

**3. Atomic Swaps**

* *What does it do?* It allows people to trade one coin for a different coin without an exchange.  This is called cross-chain swaps.  It actually utilizes LN to do it.

* *When will it be released?* Charlie reported that LTC and Decred just did an official test run but that was not through the LN.  If it takes a year for stable LN wallets, it will take longer to build AS on top of that and even longer to integrate it into the mainstream.

**4. Covenants** 

* *What does it do?* You are able to select LTC to be bound together and stay together no matter what.  When LTC blocks are formed, all the LTC are lumped together.  Covenants will allow chosen LTC not to be lumped in with the other coins but be continually bound together.  This allows Colored Coin application.  It also allows **""vaults""** which will be added to Litecoin core.  You basically lock it up so in case someone gets your priv keys, it has a delayed transaction time (let's say a day) for it to be sent out without interruption.  But you have a special ""key"" that lets you spend the LTC faster than the ones your attacker is sending.  Pretty cool stuff.  More security. 

* *When will it be released?* Honestly, I have no idea.  Right now, it doesn't seem to be a high priority from what I understand.

**5. Confidential Transactions** 

* *What does it do?* Allows anonymity between LTC transactions, something similar to Monero. 
* *When will it be released?* Charlie recently expressed in an interview that he thinks this might be the next project to work on.  So I assume once MAST is implemented, they will focus on this next.  My general guess would be in about a 6 months to a year.

**6. Colored Coins**

* *What does it do?* Allows LTC to be repurposed to be attached to an asset.  Yes.  That means ICO's.  But think bigger and be more creative. Johnson Lau speculated you can assign LTC to a computerized car like Tesla.  Your LTC could be given the property to act like a key to your car which you could send via your mobile phone. *mind blown*
* *When will it be released?* I'm not sure this is very high on their priority list.  BTC might take the lead before LTC on this one.  Maybe 2 years?

# TLDR
*MAST, LN, AS, Covenant, Confidential Transactions, and Colored Coins.*

&nbsp;

As you can see there is a lot of exciting stuff in store for LTC!

&nbsp;

Also, there is much to do.  Not only do these protocols need to be written, but they need to be constantly tested for bugs.  If you are a coder and want to help, this is their github: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin.  C++ and JAVA.  

&nbsp;

You don't have to ask if you can help or be involved, you can simply start working on the github!  They'll contact you if you are doing good work. :) After all, this is not a centralized community but a decentralized one.  That means we are all in this together and we all do our part.  That is the essence of Litecoin.

Signing off,

"I have a feeling that there will be a lot of people new to Litecoin dropping into this sub in the next 24 hours, as people see the LTC/BTC ratio rising. This is the first question on newbies minds, and there was a great response from u/shyliar in [a thread a few weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/6dnbxb/why_litecoin_when_theres_bitcoin/) ago that I want to quote here:

I've used both LTC and BTC since 2012. I started with BTC and then discovered LTC. Even in 2012 there were discussions of the limited transactional capacity of BTC, five years later it's still being discussed. In 2012 having already made a purchase with BTC I was dissatisfied with the slow confirmation times and the necessity of additional coins seemed obvious. I suggest you make a small investment in both coins and try moving them around from wallet to wallet. You'll see the lite/light quickly.

Here's a list of reasons I like Litecoin:

* Capable of eight times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.
* Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.
* Blocks are not full.
* The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.
* Anti-spam.
* Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 7,153 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (7,153TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.
*Continuous development look here at number of releases in past few years: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases
* Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2017: https://litecoincore.org/
* Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.
* Great community. Definitly helps when consensus is needed.
* Unlike bitcoin, it is possible to make changes to litecoin.
* Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify.

* Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets in fact volume has remained high month after month for years.
* The speed, liquidity and value of Litecoin is useful to traders seeking arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.
* Now on coinbase and will be on bitstamp in June.
* Fair release. In a crypto world of premined and ICO releases many appreciate this fact. The code was released well before the Genesis block was mined and everyone knew when it would be going live; therefore, individuals could anticipate and get their miners and software ready.
* It's primary function is to be a cryptocurrency.
* Still mineable in many western countries even after electrical costs are factored in. Here in Canada my Titans still make a profit long after shutting my Neptunes down.
* Many low value coins can be merge mined with it increasing profits for miners.
* It will always maintain the integrity of the blockchain (no hard forks for special interests).
* Recently activated segwit on it's network with virtually 100 percent consensus.
* The possibility of utilizing sidechains for smart contracts without the possibility of corrupting the original non-turing complete blockchain.
* Potential of using the Lightning Network as a method of increasing transactional capacity.
* Security.

With all the memes and price action posts, I think this is worth posting here again. "
If Litecoin hits $50 this week I will drink a bottle of ketchup and live stream it. 
PS: I don't hold any bitcoin but success of cyrpto world will always measured in terms of Bitcoin
"I've been lurking this forum for a long time, and it seems 90% of the people in here only care about the price... I mean, screw the price, I love the fact that Litecoin is (at least used to be) a stable coin if compared to others and can be used as a currency, for example, if I buy today a smartphone for 3 ltcs I wont have to be concerned that I could have bought 10 smartphones if I waited the infamous 2 weeks. Stability in a currency is much better than volatility, if a currency is too volatile then it's more of a commodity than a currency itself.
For me, the only crypto I'd use as a currency is Litecoin, for it's stability and amazing technology."

"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.

"Total Market Cap of Crypto has already dropped over 20-30 Billion Dollars. You must understand that this is extremely important and healthy for a market, that was very bullish in the few days. Be happy with the coins you have, do not panic sell. The market will go up again eventually. If you have money left, I personally, and ofc this is no financial advice, invest in a few hours, if the market keeps correcting._

"Guys, we need to promote LTC on r/CryptoCurrency/ and other similar reddit pages. Now is the time to explain to people why LTC is better and safer than BTC vs BCH drama."
"This is very important for people who are new to crypto-currencies to understand. I would still consider myself very new, but I'm learning. I got in around 2014, didn't make any money and didn't care about cashing out (or learning more) because my balance was a pittance so I just closed up the wallet and forgot about it until recently. Boy was that stupid.

When I came back this year, I didn't care about anything but my balance again, just concerned with the price. It seems the flood of newbies brings a whole new wave of people who are still too concerned about price. What we need to understand is the PRICE does not matter, the VALUE of crypto-currency does. It becomes more obvious the more I learn, the technology has value regardless of its price. It is not about making a quick buck, it is not about buying a Ferrari (though that is always a lovely bonus, should it come). It is about being part of a relatively new technology that is seeing unprecedented growth and has potential to change the future of our planet forever, in a positive way.

How many of you enjoy waiting for bank transfers to go through for 3-5 days (especially when you are waiting to buy more crypto)? How many love that the government prints more of your money so its worth less and less? What about the fact that you aren't actually in charge of your own money? What if you could be in charge of your own money and BE your own bank? That is the VALUE of litecoin (and bitcoin and other cryptos) and that is just merely scratching the surface.

So with that said. Do some research, stop staring at the price and learn more about the technology you are investing money into. Maybe you'll just learn something that changes your opinion about this being a cash grab. You may even become an educated advocate of cryptocurrency and might just enjoy what you learn."

*""I bought X LTC""* : We get it and we like you and if you are here is because you are interested to buy LTC or you already have. We are welcoming you with open arms :) 

*""I HODL""* : good for you and sure this does not always apply. Stop pushing everyone to hold and calling them out if they don't. Anyone can do what they want with their money/coins.

*""..here we go [animated moon meme]""* : just enough 

Reddit is the front page of the internet and one of many social networks that first newcomers are going to for info. It’s good to have useful info there instead of moon memes. Its good for the community to show that we are actively looking at new innovations and focus on technology and not only when the prices will spike.

If we want to have any chance to have this coin adopted and compete with other on the same space is to bring more people into cryptocurrency and LTC. So, we need to see more ppl buying/holding (not hodling) and using this coin. Its good to bring awareness to the cryptocurrency subs however that’s not our audience, our audience is ppl who haven’t heard about crypto yet. We want them to come in and yeah sure invest in Bitcoin (that’s what got them into crypto anyway) but then find out about the advantages of LTC as soon as possible to invest here as well.

You can hate all you want Bitcoin Cash but they have taken the LTC rhetoric (low fees etc) and addressing it to ppl outside the crypto community, not internally to the crypto community. Of course the bitcoin name next to Cash and the recent fork gave them already external exposure (and free coins) but hey that only gives them a head start but not for long (it showing already). This is what we should be doing.

"We as a community should start pushing litecoin forward in a decentralized way. Why are we always waiting for Charlie to say something 'positive' in a tweet or to give us an 'update' ? From my observation, I have to admit 95% of this community are spineless, weak and are here to be 'made rich' by Charlie. No offence but this is the sad truth. Most of you guys/gals want to be carried off into the sunset with a few mill in your back pockets. Well the sad truth is that WONT happen just because you hodl litecoin. We have to work for litecoin to succeed and in time we will be rewarded financially but the aim of the game is to change the world with litecoin at the forefront of this impending revolution. So lets start promoting litecoin, encouraging large scale adoption by lobbying retailers and lets start pushing litecoin into a direction which suits the larger litecoin community. This coin was created by Charlie Lee but it will have to exist based on its own merit not solely on Charlie Lee's tweets/announcements. And it is our responsibility as a community to make litecoin the best cryptocurrency out there."

"**Progress Update:**  As of this post, we're up to 482 LTC donated. We've exceeded our 100,000 tree goal by just over 7,000 trees! We have 6 days to go until the fundraiser ends.


We just wanted to show you guys how fired up our employees are about getting started on the Litecoin forest.


* Images here: http://imgur.com/a/oeJ8R#0

I know most of you guys are miners, and you're sensitive to the carbon footprint mining has. Just so you know, the things you see them planting in these photos are mangrove propagules. ""Mangrove Forests store up to four times as much carbon as other tropical forests, including rainforests."" (http://bit.ly/1nKJuQr)


By donating to Eden, the Litecoin community is giving back in more ways than they can imagine, and again our Malagasy (Malagasy is what you call people from Madagascar) staff is fired up.

**BTW** In a PM, /u/Coblee has suggested that we name your forest the Litecoin forest. We love this idea! To take it a step further, we want to place a permanent sign at the forest site to commemorate this fundraiser. To that extent, we know people in the LTC community have skills, without a doubt mining skills, most likely bowstaff skills, and we're hoping graphic design skills...kinda like /u/COOKIEEE and his post (http://bit.ly/1dYGPKb). 

**Is there anyone out there that wants to design the sign for the Litecoin community?** We would leave it up to you guys as a community to pick the winner.

Let us know in the comments below.

We know the Litecoin community is an international bunch (never seen so many international hits from so many countries in our analytics reports ever). As soon as the fundraiser ends, and the reforestation site is finalized, we will have GPS coordinates for the Litecoin forest and if anyone is ever in Madagascar and wants to visit, we would love for you to come and check it out!

What I just realized today though is that Coinbase users have grown exponentially since this time last year.  They now have 20M users!  With 20M Coinbase users and only 56M litecoins in existence right now there are literally less than 3 litecoins available for every user on Coinbase.

Looking out globally this coin is even more rare.  So on this Friday before Memorial Day weekend I am going to do my part and buy 3 litecoins with the hope that some of you can also take 3 more off the market w me!

This sub is pitiful right now.

I won't go into too many specifics but in addition to general FUD, a lot of the posts and comments come off as desperate, overly eager, and just generally pathetic. The constant comments about potential Amazon adoption, Facebook partnership, Charlie's surprise, complaining about price, etc seriously make the community look sad and generally unlikable. 

Picture that creepy, overbearing guy at a party that no one wants to associate with, that's this sub. Imagine a sore loser after a basketball game, that's this sub. Think about the buzzkill in your social group who's always bringing everyone down around them, that's this sub.

I say all that to say this, think back to when you were first getting started in crypto and you were browsing subs and found one like this..do you think you'd want to get involved? Reddit is important to new people and perception is reality.

"See the linked reddit comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rzjjl/zipzap_adds_25k_locations_in_uk_and_240k/cdshqvu 

This is a huge win for Litecoin as it's even harder to buy Litecoin with cash than Bitcoin.

To explain the comments:

- cryptocyprus works with easyco.in
- The role of easyco.in in the ZipZap news: ""You are buying Bitcoin or Litecoin from easyco.in and ZipZap enables the payment to be completed at thousands of locations around the world using cash.""
- Cryptocyrus also says: ""We are integrating Litecoin onto the easyco.in platform. This information wasnt meant to be released for a while yet.""
- Concludes with ""Haha no its okay. Its a very important step for making Bitcoin and Litecoin accessible. Next step the developing markets, we are integrating MPesa to this platform too."""
"Hi Guys,

After witnessing a lot of shit posts with people complaining about why Charlie didnt say ""this or that"" about Litecoin, i wanted to break down what the REAL problem with Litecoin is.

It is you, the misinformed.

Here are a few points of discussion you should google and fully wrap your head around, before spreading more cancerous misinformed complaints:

- ""litecoin is silver to bitcoins gold"" , this is Charlies vision, if you do not like it...then fucking leave. Please do some fucking research before buying into something. Or go buy some scammy shit like Dash

- ""bitcoin is more secure than litecoin"" , well because maybe it is? Try researching about the network hashrate of bitcoin and wrap your fucking heads around how much larger it is than the rest of crypto combined. Also, he said this comment from a techie perspective.

- people complaining about litecoin being set up to be ""beta"" to bitcoins ""alpha"" have to really understand bitcoins network hashrate. The amount of fucking electricity and resources that are supporting it are IMMENSE.

NO COIN IS EVEN FUCKING CLOSE

A month ago, there were tons of fucktards giggling about how ETH would overtake bitcoin but just couldnt wrap their heads around this idea of network hash rate.

- Anyone complaining about the PR just doesnt fucking get it. Decentralized currency isnt a fucking corporation. If this bothers you, then go buy the next scammy ICO or Dash. Otherwise, try to use google and read up on this shit and use your fucking brains

-  some of you fucking cunts might be surprised to see how large Litecoins network hash is vs other coins, go look it up. (Hint: this is the reason why i strongly believe in this project)

- fuck you if you downvote this, i will have the last laugh when you lose the shirt off your back"

I've seen a handful of reddit topics more recently on the issue - still no response??

**Are Litecoin devs just going to stick their heads in the sand and hope for the best?** At least post a written response on the issue? Do they have any plan? It's too late to implement these things when half of the mining community have invested money into ASICs, the time is to do it now before they become entrenched and the centralisation of mining power begins. ASIC resistance is supposed to  be Litecoins unique selling point, I really don't see why anyone would be opposed to trivially modifying the Scrypt algorithm to use more memory... (apart from people who have ordered ASICs), the same amount of coins per day will still be created no-one will be worse off.

All I see looking to the future is disadvantages:

- Litecoin loses it's unique selling point over Bitcoin
- Mining becomes increasingly centralised
- The everyday miner with GPUs will end up getting forced out. It may take 5 times longer than with Bitcoin but it will happen imo
- Looks bad from a marketing perspective that Litecoin advertises itself as ASIC resistant for years and suddenly ASICs are popping up
etc.

I see no solid reasons why not to change the memory requirement of Scrypt."

"After spending quite a bit of time on this subreddit, I am quite disappointed in the litecoin community. About 80% of the post is literal time wasting moon praying. Instead of spending time war-fighting about when or by how much litecoin will go up by, I urge the community to utilize their skills to help spread the utility of litecoin as fast as possible. It honestly feels like Lee and like 3 developers holding up an entire community on their own. If you want the price of Litecoin to go up, then help out. That is the best way to ensure the success of litecoin.

Examples:

1) If you are a developer, integrate litecoin in whatever platform you are coding for.

2) If you are a student, call businesses or talk to owner of businesses that you frequent to have them integrate litecoin into their business. At the very least, get them interested in cryptocurrency.

3) If you are have financial connections, connect upwards and convince the heads to adopt crypto into their portfolios.

4) If you are in any office setting and you keep checking the prices and subreddit, stop it. Email or call businesses on the applications you use frequently to adopt litecoin.

5) If you are in any other setting, you can help by writing articles or documentation or videos for people to use litecoin more easily. Like updating litecoin.info.

Honestly we need more programmers for this community. All the other altcoins are slowly kicking our ass. 

Me personally, I am a web developer. Our program links a lot of local businesses into a singular web platform. So my goal right now is to link these businesses together to use litecoin as a medium of transfer. Also, why the hell are we still using command line codes to transfer paper wallet amount to each other?!? Litecoin has been around 5+ years and no one stepped up to integrate it properly in a consumer friendly manner. Guess its another thing I'll have to fix. 
I will notify the community once the program is completed."
"I decided to write this up because there's a lot of confusion about what a ""Node"" is.  I personally had to do a lot of research to figured this out myself.  If anyone would like to suggest edits, I welcome them.
 
Due to the decentralized nature of Litecoin, sometimes key terms or definitions don’t get standardized.  This is particularly problematic for newcomers who want to learn about Litecoin but get confused by variant vocabulary.  For example, a Full Litecoin Node to one person may mean something slightly different to another.  In light of this, below I suggest a list of terms to help the community use the same definitions and language in regards to Litecoin Nodes.
 
#A Node

Before we talk about Litecoin Nodes, let’s talk about nodes in a broad sense.  In a distributed network, the simplest way to define a node would be to say it is a point of intersection or connection with the network.  It can act as both a redistribution point or a communication endpoint.  This loose definition helps us better understand the different ways a Litecoin Node functions within the Litecoin Network.  The following definitions should collectively be considered Litecoin Nodes.
 
#A Full Node

A Full Litecoin Node is an integral component of the Litecoin Network because it validates the blockchain. It does this by downloading a copy of it. It is also capable of relaying transactions and recent blocks, but this isn’t required to be considered a Full Node. Now when you first open up a Full Node client like Litecoin Core, most people are sitting behind a firewall. In this case, your Full Node is limited in the number of connections it can connect to (around 8) and only looks for Super Nodes a.k.a. Listening Nodes. The reason for this is because your Full Node isn’t publicly connectable yet.
 
#A Super Node a.k.a. Listening Node

In a distributed network, a Super Node functions as a highly connected redistribution point as well as a relay station. Therefore this would be an appropriate term to describe a publicly connectable Full Litecoin Node. This means many nodes can connect to it to obtain relayed transactional data and blockchain history. This may require more bandwidth and CPU than a Full Node because of all the extra work it’s doing. These Super Nodes are normally on 24/7 and are reliable focal points for other nodes to connect to. In order to activate this within a Litecoin client functioning as a node, you must make it publicly connectable. One way to do this is to bypass any potential firewalls and/or setup port forwarding. Some manuals suggest running litecoind(litecoin daemon) in the background instead of Litecoin-Qt, but this isn’t necessary.

u/aaron0791 Raspberry Pi [guide](https://redd.it/78x624) can either be a super node or a full node depending on whether it is publicly connectable.  You can run it with the litecoind as well in order to avoid setting up a GUI with the Raspberry Pi.

#A Miner’s Node

Today, miners utilize mining programs separate from Litecoin Core to mine Litecoin blocks. Some miners choose to solo mine and therefore use their own Full Node to maintain a full copy of the blockchain via litecoind. Others choose to pool mine and work together to solve blocks. In this case, the admin of the pool maintains a Full Node while pool miners contribute their hashpower. A third method, though highly discouraged and harmful to the network, is to SPV mine by mining on top of blocks before fully validating them. These SPV pool miners typically trust another mining pool’s Full Node as a reference to build on top of. In light of this, a Miner’s Node can be further subcategorized as either a Solo Miner’s Full Node or a Pool Miner’s Full Node.
 
#A Simplified Payment Verification(SPV) Client a.k.a. Thin Client a.k.a. Light Wallets

SPV clients like Loafwallet (the Litecoin App for smartphones) are not Full Nodes because they don’t download the blockchain. SPV clients do this by ensuring your transactions are put in a block and then confirm that other blocks are being added to it. Therefore in the loosest sense, an SPV Client may fit the criteria of a node. However, they don’t do much to support and validate the distributed trustless ledger of Litecoin. Instead, they store just copies of all the headers of all the blocks in the blockchain that are taken from other Super Nodes. Therefore, SPV clients are unable to verify any transactions in the chain because they don’t have access to it. In this way, they function as communication endpoints as they are are unable to relay transactions or blockchain data. Additionally, it is important to put your own full nodes behind them to securely use SPV clients as wallets.
 
#Specialized “Edge Routing” Nodes

Other types of nodes exist where Full Nodes are stripped of its wallet and mining capabilities.  Entities such exchanges and merchant payment processors then build on top of these specialized “edge routing” nodes.  
 
#Conclusion

Above, I’ve briefly described the various roles a Litecoin Node can have.  I’ve also included a broad overview of the necessary steps a user would need to take to use Litecoin Core in these roles.  Hopefully by providing this list of terminology, it will empower users to understand what exact role they are playing in the network and to inform them of the steps they can take if they want to play a different one.

"I think we can be very thankful to have a guy like Charlie Lee as the founder of Litecoin. Besides being a charismatic face of Litecoin, he's talked about how he didn't premine litecoin at all when he created and released it to the community. I thought I'd bring some extra attention to his recent pledge and eventual donation of 225 LTC to charity to support the tree planting efforts. His edit shows that he didn't want to dliute his holdings so he literally spent what would have been around $5000 to be able to meet what he promised and then he posted proof of payment. That is pretty damn awesome and shows what kind of guy he is. 

Good work Charlie. You seem like you'd be an interesting person to meet. \o/ 

And as Charlie has mentioned, please continue donating to the tree campaign that will be active until February 8th.

"In the past few weeks, this subreddit has seen tens of thousands of new subscribers due to Litecoin’s recent meteoric rise into triple digits. I’m very happy that the community is growing, but I’ve been left with the impression that many of the new users are unfamiliar with Litecoin’s positioning in the cryptocurrency universe, as such I want to clear up some basic information — namely, what is Litecoin’s history, and what distinguishes it from Bitcoin?

&nbsp;

Litecoin was created by forking the source code of Bitcoin in 2011. For non programmers, this means the code was literally copied, line-for-line, from the Bitcoin project on Github. The initial developers made three significant modifications to the project that distinguish it from Bitcoin:

&nbsp;

* The time it takes to mine a block of Litecoin was reduced to 2.5 minutes from 10 minutes.
* The maximum number of possible coins was increased by a factor of 4.
* The mining algorithm was changed to Script from SHA1.

&nbsp;


This means that, despite these radical changes, Bitcoin and Litecoin are remarkably similar in most respects. For example, both currencies rely on the principle of distributed mining, making it infeasible for any one group to “control” the history of Litecoin. Yet by changing the time it takes to mine a block, a Litecoin transaction will (on average) receive acknowledgements more quickly than a Bitcoin transaction. In addition, changing the mining algorithm to Scrypt from SHA1 kept the mining community accessible to “everyday Joes”.  Whereas Bitcoin’s SHA1 algorithm can be run on expensive hardware that is roughly 1000x faster than a GPU, Litecoin’s Scrypt algorithm is very memory intensive, therefore it is difficult to develop such “high speed” mining hardware. To date, mining Litecoin on a high-end consumer GPU is somewhat reasonable.

&nbsp;

One might wonder why it was valuable to create a “clone” version of Bitcoin in the first place. Why would we need another? To this, I would argue that there is value in redundancy. If, for example, a malicious group of users find an effective method of abusing the Bitcoin network (a DDOS, for example), Litecoin exists as a fallback. Of course, Litecoin may well also be susceptible to such attacks, but then malicious users would have to attack both networks in tandem which would be more difficult.

&nbsp;

Lastly, I’ve heard too much talk about Litecoin itself being rendered “obsolete” by up and coming features on the Bitcoin network. Since Litecoin was forked from Bitcoin, it’s unlikely that there will exist a feature that Bitcoin creates that is inaccessible to Litecoin. Since Litecoin is under active development, and is relatively drama-free, there are times when Litecoin has features that Bitcoin hasn’t yet managed to develop. For example, support for SegWit was added about a year ago with overwhelming acceptance from the mining community.

&nbsp;

tl;dr, Litecoin and Bitcoin are largely similar with a few key differences. I believe they the two currencies will benefit each other in the long run. The idea that one will render the other obsolete is ridiculous."
"People need to learn how to use the search bar. So many duplicate questions. Congratulations on buying your first litecoin,but you don’t need to make a post about it. This subreddit is clogged up with repeat questions and “first litecoin” posts.
Maybe there should be a stickied post on various topics.
“First Time Buyers” where people can write about the first litecoin purchase
“Buying and Selling Questions” where people can ask and learn more about buying from Coinbase, fees, LoafWallet.

Mods can you do something about this?

"To Litecoin miners and pool operators,

致所有的矿工以及矿池主：

As you all know, the Litecoin developers and I worked on adding SegWit to Litecoin last year. We have taken tremendous efforts on it in order to help Litecoin rise again and wished that miners and pools would support this and signal for SegWit. As it turned out, we have not done a good job at convincing you why SegWit is good for Litecoin. I hope this letter can help.

我想你们已经了解到，最近一年内，莱特币开发人员和我都在为添加隔离见证到莱特币而工作。为此，我们花了大量的时间和精力，只为让莱特币能够东山再起，并盼望矿工与矿池能够早日支持并且激活隔离见证。但遗憾的是，我们并没有成功地让你们意识到为什么隔离见证对莱特币有好处。我希望这封信能够有所帮助。

First of all, a lot of criticism about SegWit comes from Bitcoin's perspective. SegWit is not a good scaling solution. I agree. It is not. Litecoin, currently, is not running into a block size problem. Litecoin has 4 times the capacity of Bitcoin, so it likely won't run into any capacity issues for many years. Our reasoning for adding SegWit is not because of it's small block size bump. SegWit has a fix for transaction malleability, which lets us add new technologies like Lightning Networks. SegWit also opens up the possibility of adding many other improvements like Schnorr signatures or Confidential Transactions. All of these improvements are going to help Litecoin tremendously. And with Bitcoin stalling due to the block size scaling deadlock, Litecoin can really shine if we can get SegWit on Litecoin.

首先，很多的关于隔离见证的批评都是站在比特币的视角得出来的。隔离见证不是一个好的解决扩容问题的方案。这点的确如此。莱特币目前并没有区块大小的问题。莱特币有4倍于比特币的容量，因此它在未来很多年之内都不会有区块容量的问题。我们支持隔离见证并不是因为小区块冲突，而是因为隔离见证可以修复交易可锻性，进而可以让我们添加更多的新技术如闪电网络。隔离见证也让很多其他的升级成为了可能，如：Schnorr签名和匿名交易。所有的这些功能都将极大地帮助莱特币的发展。在比特币因为区块大小问题停滞不前的时候，如果我们能够在莱特币上激活隔离见证，莱特币必将发光。

People also complain about the complexity of SegWit code. I don't think miners or pools need to worry about that. The Litecoin development team is comfortable with the SegWit code and we never have any trouble about it. In a healthy ecosystem, each party contributes its best. We are confident in what we do best, coding. We also welcome you introducing more talents to join our development team.

很多人也抱怨过隔离见证代码复杂性的问题，我觉得这个担心是没有必要的。莱特币开发团队很有信心能够自如地应对隔离见证的代码，我们从来就没有遇到过什么问题。在一个健康的生态系统中，每一方贡献自己的最好的一面。我们有信心做到自己的最好。我们也欢迎矿工和矿池介绍更多的天才加入开发团队。

Xinxi Wang has worked hard to set up a Litecoin Foundation. We will work towards getting funding for it so that we can hire a few full-time Litecoin developers. I will be the Managing Director and I will work with the Litecoin development team to improve Litecoin. However, a lot of what we want to work on depends on SegWit being activated. PZ is also in the process of setting up a foundation in the Cayman Island. I expect this might also help Litecoin and the development team in the future.

新喜正在努力注册莱特币基金会。我们会共同努力为其募集资金以雇佣全职开发人员。我也会成为基金会的总裁，与莱特币开发人员并肩作战，一起提升莱特币。但是，我们的开发计划很大部分工作都取决于隔离见证是否会被激活。PZ也准备在开曼群岛设立一个基金会。我觉得将来这有可能帮助莱特币及其开发团队。

I also believe that the market is waiting for Litecoin to get SegWit and the price will react positively if SegWit is activated. Seeing all these other altcoins pump is definitely disheartening. So let's give the market what it wants.

我相信市场在等待莱特币激活隔离见证，那时，莱特币价格也会有积极的响应。看到其他的竞争币价格飙升而莱特币纹丝不动实在是令人沮丧。让我们给市场市场想要的吧。

For concerns about on-chain scaling, I understand your concerns. I promise you if and when the need arises for Litecoin to scale on-chain, the Litecoin developers and I will execute a hard fork to increase max block size for Litecoin.

对于链上扩容的顾虑，我能理解。我向你们承诺，如果莱特币有链上扩容的需求，莱特币开发人员和我都会采用硬分叉的形式来提升莱特币的区块大小。

Lastly, I plan to travel to China in June and want to meet with as many of the Chinese miners and pool operators as possible. I would love to hear your opinions about what you think the Litecoin development team should work on next. And at that time, I would much rather talk to you about new Litecoin features as oppose to still trying to convince you about SegWit.

最后，我计划六月份去中国，希望能见尽可能多的矿工以及矿池主。我很想知道你们的关于莱特币开发团队未来工作的意见或者建议。到那时候，我希望更多的时间是用来跟你们谈谈莱特币未来的新特性而不是去说服你们激活隔离见证。

I hope you will trust in me, my vision, and the Litecoin development team. We all want the best for Litecoin and we are all in this together. Let Litecoin take the lead!

我衷心希望你们会相信我，我的愿景以及莱特币开发团队。我们都希望莱特币能够做到最好，并且我们都在为此奋斗着。让莱特币成为领头羊！

Thanks,

Charlie Lee

Litecoin Creator

Hey Everyone, 

My name is Chris from [HODL](https://alwayshodl.com) the official merchandise partner of crypto. I’ve personally been an advocate and believer in Litecoin for years so it’s been amazing to have the opportunity to collaborate with their team and design initiatives to promote the currency while giving back to the community.
 

We’ve have been working with the Litecoin team over the last few months to ramp up their marketing efforts and create a merchandise line that the community would love. I’ll be joining the Litecoin Foundation livestream later today to share in more detail how we are planning to accelerate marketing in the future. 


For the first marketing announcement of the week, we are excited to launch the **New Litecoin Merchandise** line in collaboration with the Litecoin core team and Foundation today.


**Shop Here**>> https://www.alwayshodl.com/litecoin


**To celebrate the launch we are having 20% off all Litecoin Merchandise for the next 48 hours.**

With LTC being the cryptocurrency for payment it was critical that you could buy their merch using Litecoin. That’s exactly what you can do. 

**Use Litecoin to pay for their merchandise and save an additional 10%**


**Shop Here and Pay with Litecoin** >>https://www.alwayshodl.com/litecoin

Driving global awareness and giving back to the Litecoin Foundation are both super important. So for all the Litecoin + HODL Merchandise:

* A percentage of each sale goes back to the Litecoin Foundation
* Products ship anywhere in the world

**To give back to the best LTC community I will be picking 5 people that comment on this thread with an awesome Litecoin HODL story and send them Free LTC Merch. So comment with your story and let’s represent!**

A few weeks ago Charlie announced on twitter that LTC is pushing their marketing efforts with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/938433421520527360) and he wasn’t messing around.


Over the next 3 days we will be announcing a new marketing initiative each day in this thread. We will edit the original post to highlight the new announcement and you will also see them on social coming from the Litecoin team. 


So keep an eye out and let’s spread the word that Litecoin is moving full steam ahead.

"Hey fellow Litecoiners! I've been a long-time hodler/supporter of Litecoin, and this year has been one helluva ride for cryptos. I'm in the process of starting a business and have been looking into accepting LTC on my webstore.

However, upon trying to Google a standardized ""Litecoin Accepted Here"" logo to place on my site, I wasn't able to find one... despite Litecoin being around for 6 years! In fact, I couldn't find *any* standardized Litecoin logo at all (with Google results showing me a hodge-podge of options, using different font styles and whatnot).

So after some experimentation, I ended up re-designing the existing Litecoin logos, into what I hope to become a standardized Litecoin logo for everyone to use! Without further adieu, my interpretation:

* [**Logo**](https://imgur.com/GLD7RHk)
* [All variations](https://imgur.com/AXcqW7d)
* [""Accepted Here"" 1](https://imgur.com/Z4mv5SJ), [""Accepted Here"" 2](https://imgur.com/k8TfqQG)
* [Black](https://imgur.com/exuww1G), [Blue](https://imgur.com/PBqDaBY), [Silver](https://imgur.com/rMx18hW), [Silver & Black](https://imgur.com/JVriJBZ)
* [Ł-circle](https://imgur.com/v08gboL), [""Litecoin""](https://imgur.com/EBOmxF1)

----------

Design philosophy:

* Since Lightning Network is just around the corner, I've changed the slash in the Ł to look a bit sleeker (perhaps reminiscent of a lightning bolt). The visual difference is clear, but the change is subtle enough to still be recognizable as the Litecoin logo.
* Both the Ł-circle and the ""Litecoin"" word must be independently recognizable. While the Ł-circle was already recognizable by itself, I haven't found any previous designs for the word ""Litecoin"" that's unique to Litecoin. So for the word ""Litecoin"", I picked a fitting font style with enough slant, made some tweaks to letter spacing, and lastly added a small visual marker to the ""E"".
* Color-independency: While logos with a lot of shades/colors look fancy, they tend to lose their identity in monotone environments (imagine the Batman logo beaming into the sky). As a result, I've chosen for my logo to be defined by only its shape. Meaning it can be used in black&white, or be etched in metal/wood and still be recognizable. As you can see from the different variations, the colors can all be changed on-the-fly, but the logo shape remains consistent throughout.

I've published this work with CC0 (Creative Commons Zero), so you are free to use the logo or any of its variations, anywhere and however you feel like (even for commercial purposes). Feedback is welcome! ***Long live Litecoin!!!***

**Edit**: I'm adding another set of logos, this time with a ring around the Ł-circle to resemble more of a coin (as suggested by a community member)

"First, STOP posting about it in /r/litecoin, post about it in /r/litecoinmarkets. Please.

My guess is that many of you are younger people who have little to no experience in the trading or investing world. Litecoin and cryptocurrency has been your fast-track tunnel bore into investing and now you find yourself flabbergasted by the concept of volatility.

I invite you to look at a chart for Tesla (TSLA), one of the most established and successful ~~blue chip~~ technology stocks on the public market. Look at its movement for all available timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y). You will find bursts of volatility in nearly all of them. No publicly traded commodity, security, or currency, will EVER maintain a steady upward trajectory. People buy, people sell, people get emotional and they overbuy and oversell. Don't get emotional, stop looking at the charts like it's Instagram, and relax. 

Your posts asking someone to explain what the last 6 hours of price movement means just makes this community seem full of  overzealous college freshmen who have no clue what they're throwing their money at. It de-legitimizes the coin. Focus on what matters, forget about the hourly price movement, and your weak hands will disappear."
"I just hope this makes some of those people who've called me all names under the sun, accused me of being pessimistic, telling me how wrong I am, all those wannabe overnight millionaires, those who blindly downvote anything that doesn't equate to rash ""predicitons"" about the price.

Please, please, take this as a lesson in being patient. Support the network. Tell people about LTC. Email exchanges. Approach local businesses. Share articles on Facebook etc, THEN you will see the price increase SLOWLY and STEADILY.

And by the way, as far as I'm concerned, those of you with the ""Well I didn't make my money and the diff is too high,so I'm off to another coin instead"" can fuck off frankly. Good riddance.

Big shout to the man who told me ""$30 within 12 hours."", to the guy who told me ""LTC should be worth $100 right now, it's undervalued."", and to those of you who smeared your smarmy smirky ""told you so"" comments all over my posts when we TIPPED OVER $20 for a short while. I stick by what I've said ALL ALONG, $20, a stable $20 isn't likely this year, let alone just because another exchange opens. Well done you.

Looking forward to this being downvoted to hell once again.

EDIT: I've really riled the gang this time, my inbox is awash with torrents of abuse! Well done you people, well done."
"Imagine looking at a new revolutionary form of currency that is changing the world, and being able to say, ""I created that"". Imagine the passion you would feel for its continued success.

- His incentive for LTC success has nothing to do with wealth. This is his creation. No one wants to see this work more than him.

He was director of engineering at Coinbase. Between any equity he has there and any BTC he probably has, he is doing fine monetarily.

- Many say, ""it's a terrible sign when the owner of a company sells their position of stock"".

New Flash: This is a currency...not a stock.

- Charlie can now passionately pursue the growth and success of the currency he created without fear...knowing that people can't point fingers at him and say he is manipulating price.

My guess is that for someone like Charlie and his personality, this is a relief.

- He's smart, and if all coin creators followed his lead, the integrity of cryptocurrency would be better maintained. Although we know most creators would not do this.

- Let him be the innovator he wants to be. He doesn't want to be the CEO of a company, which is how everyone is looking at him.

I could go on and on, but the point is, this is a healthy move in what has become an even more volatile market. A lot of manipulation seems to be coming to the surface, and I'm proud that the creator of LiteCoin doesn't want any part of it."

"Hey everyone!  About 2 months ago I posted [My Call To Arms: An Action Plan to Contact Businesses](https://redd.it/6esl9d) and it went pretty well.  We contacted over 50 businesses!  It was perfect timing too because it was right before LTC jumped to the $30's.


&nbsp;


Anyways, I'm posting here to start another campaign.  I was talking with u/drcpperpot and he had a great idea to use MAST to get about 6000 redditors to donate about .1 LTC to the Litecoin Foundation which would be sent once the address hit 600LTC.  We thought this would be an awesome demonstration of a use case for MAST...but alas, MAST is still unavailable.  So instead, this is what I propose to my LTC community.


&nbsp;

# The #'s

1. Litecoin Foundation’s total assets is about [$176,000]( https://litecoin-foundation.org/2017/07/financial-statements-2017-06/)  

2. There are 44,000 subscribers to this sub.  

3. If we each donated .2 LTC that would give the Litecoin Foundation over $500000.  But let's make the goal 999LTC to be a little more realistic.

4. This would nearly double their fund.

5. And we all know that well fed dev’s = a well developed LTC

# My Proposal

1. Comment below with your LTC pledge to the LTC Foundation.  Then update us with a screenshot of your transaction to the Litecoin Donation address to earn a pat on the shoulder from a member of the LTC community!  You can use imgur to host your pictures.

2. Ecurrencyhodler’s Special:  For the first 50 people to pledge and donate 1 LTC, I will send .02LTC back to you!  I need a screenshot of your transaction which includes your address and the foundation's address as well as for you to post your address so I can confirm and copy/paste it into my wallet.

3. Lastly, tweet it out to see if we can get others to join in on the #LTCPledge!

# My One Request to u/coblee

1. Charlie, if you're reading this.  We want to tell you that we love you, support you, and that your last couple of interviews were pretty good!  But take a couple grand from our donations and get some PR training so you can get even more comfortable in the hot seat!  

# Litecoin Foundation Address

1. [3BTxuixRkhMQfTSqCLmq9Wn4jJ9H3dszhX](https://litecoin-foundation.org/donation/) <-- click here to confirm this actually is the LTCFoundation donation address

Alright folks!  Great job!  It's been a week since we started and the drive is officially over.  Here are some stats:  48 pledges, 34 of them more than 1+ LTC, the biggest donation was 7.7777LTC, and averaged about 8.7LTC per day for a grand total of 61.28 LTC or over $3000.

I kind of went overboard last time, Posted Memes and such then got banned by admin on btc-e.com after contributing to a riot to lower withdrawal fee's of LTC <3

BTC-e Fee's are 0.1 LTC Per withdrawal, Couple months ago it was 0.5 LTC Per withdrawal and it halted the growth of the economy for months until Reddit took Action. We are nearing a Value Rise that it is becoming necessary to take action again. 

0.5 LTC per withdrawal was extremely high, It was around 3$ per coin when LTC peaked at 6$ after that it became unpractical for users to invest and buy a single LTC or a couple LTC without giving a majority of it to BTC-E.


[They did lower the fee's to 0.1 LTC after a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1kln0l/btce_ltc_withdrawal_fee_now_01_ltc/) when people started promoting use of alternative exchanges such as cryptsy and mxcnow and the trade volume dropped dramatically on btc-e.


As of now, Withdrawal of LTC is costing $1.50 on BTC-E. We are nearing another milestone so contact BTC-e through the following methods and ask them nicely to lower there fee's:

**TLDR;** LTC Withdrawal Fee's on BTC-E are GETTING TOO DAMN HIGH!"
"I thought I'd write up a brief post on why 5/10 is a big day for Litecoin as a way to reflect and in case you're new.  A lot of this is going to briefly cover Bitcoin's history \(hopefully somewhat objectively\), but there's a reason for that as it will show you the role Litecoin played and the continued role it could continue to play in the future.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Today marks the day when Litecoin successfully activated SegWit.  This was an important moment for both the Bitcoin and Litecoin communities.  In the beginning of 2017, there were 3 main topics of contention in the bitcoin community:

1. There were rumblings of covert ASIC BOOST mining on the Bitcoin network.
2. There was also talk about the need for a[ transaction malleability](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bug-guide-transaction-malleability/) fix for transaction id's, particularly because this would be needed if 2nd layer solutions like the Lightning Network ever were to transpire.  As a side note, transaction malleability is just  fancy way of saying that there was more than 1 way to create a tx id.  Even though, LTC would be sent to the correct address, accounting was difficult because there could be multiple tx id's for the same transaction which created conflicting pieces of information.
3. Bitcoin's blocks were getting full and so there were talks of increasing the blocksize to process more transactions.

# Segwit: The Possible Solution

Segwit was first proposed by  Pieter Wiulle in 2015 in order to address the problem of malleability. Later on, a positive side\-effect to SegWit that was discovered was that it could naturally increase the blocksize to just under 4 mb.

However, there was much resistance in the Bitcoin community to hardfork in order to implement this protocol.  That's when Luke\-jr proposed a soft fork i.e. some nodes are SegWit and others are not.  This is why you can currently broadcast to both legacy and segwit transactions from the same wallet.  However in order to achieve this, no true segwit addresses were utilized \(hence the current need for Bech32 SegWit addresses\).  Instead, SegWit transactions are nested into a script \(a.k.a a smart contract\) called a ""Pay 2 Script Hash"".  *If you want to learn more, I highly recommend Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 7 by Andreas.*

By soft forking, the hope was that SegWit could:

1. Make covert ASIC BOOST mining negligible if not useless.
2. Fix Transaction Malleability to set the path towards the Lightning Network.
3. Increase the blocksize to a hypothetical 4 mb block \(2mb average\) ""weight"" as a temporary stop\-gap.

However, the method of implementing a SegWit soft\-fork through P2SH had never been done before and FUD started circulating around this topic.  Some claimed that there was a problem of ""anyone could spend"" the script that was used to lock up the SegWit transactions.  Since there was so much in\-fighting between implementing a SegWit softfork and simply just increasing blocksizes in lieu of SegWit, the Bitcoin community was stuck.

They then attempted to settle this debate through miner signaling.  This meant miner's would run the client software they supported which would then be recorded in the block that they successfully submit.  Turns out the miners responsible for extending the majority of Bitcoin's blockchain wanted a simple blocksize increase instead of SegWit.

This then created another wave of debate as the discussion shifted towards how to exactly determine ""consensus.""  Then bitcoin clients were released that allowed non\-mining nodes to ""signal"" in support of SegWit or a Blocksize increase.  This revealed that many users actually believed in SegWit, contrary to what the miners wanted \(although even here there is some debate as to the authenticity of these nodes as they can be spoofed\).  It is from this movement that the phrase ""User Activated Soft Fork"" \(UASF\) was born.

# How Does Litecoin Fit into All of This?

In the beginning of 2017, Charlie wrote up an article outlining[ his vision for Litecoin, SegWit, and the Lightning Network](https://segwit.org/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b).  He \(along with the Litecoin core team\) then worked hard [to convince and gain consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/63cgfc/my_letter_to_chinese_miners_and_pool_operators_on/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) among miners to implement segwit.  In fact, they even hosted a ""[Litecoin Roundtable](https://medium.com/@Litecoinchina/litecoin-global-roundtable-resolution-001-2017-c67b729bc06d)"".

It was out of this agreement that the Litecoin dev team could confidently move forward with soft\-forking SegWit onto Litecoin which officially occurred on 5/10/17.

With the success of the soft fork, it showed that it wasn't difficult to implement and that it wouldn't disrupt the network.  Even though Bitcoin developers could have tested the implementation on testnet, nothing beats a live main net version to ""test"" on.

Oh, and Litecoin implementing Segwit also proved that the ""anyone can spend"" FUD was...well just FUD.

# The $1 MM SegWit Bounty

A random redditor \([u/throwaway40338210716](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway40338210716)\) created a throwaway account and posted a [$1 MM Bounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/6azeu1/1mm_segwit_bounty/) for anyone who could ""steal"" the LTC from the P2SH address.  This person even provided the raw hex tx for miners to try and steal the funds from:

>010000000100a2cc0c0851ea26111ca02c3df8c3aeb4b03a6acabb034630a86fea74ab5f4d0000000017160014a5ad2fd0b2a3d6d41b4bc00feee4fcfd2ff0ebb9ffffffff010000000000000000086a067030776e336400000000

\(P.S. u/coblee later revealed [he was the person who put up this bounty](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/914372293232660481)\)

No one was successful in doing so.  In fact, the funds were left there for about [4 months](http://explorer.litecoin.net/address/3MidrAnQ9w1YK6pBqMv7cw5bGLDvPRznph)...or just a few weeks after Bitcoin activated SegWit.

# Litecoin's Value as the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold

Though many Bitcoin maximalists may not admit this, Litecoin was an important part in helping implement SegWit onto Bitcoin:

1. Litecoin proved it was safe to do so on main net.
2. The $1 MM Bounty proved P2SH transactions were safe disproved the ""anyone can spend"" FUD.

In the end, there were many reasons as to why Bitcoin ultimately implemented SegWit...one of it being the SegWit2X NYA agreement.  However it is undeniable that Litecoin played its part in squashing the FUD surrounding SegWit thereby removing some of the huge roadblocks Bitcoin faced during these debates.

In light of all this, we now can look forward to an exciting future of layer 2 scaling solutions through the Lightning Network.  Suffice it to say, there are many mutual benefits to Litecoin being the silver to Bitcoin's gold \(an analogy that highlights the close relationship Litecoin's codebase has to Bitcoin's\), two of which we've seen this year alone:

1. It allows us to be a testbed for Bitcoin.  Nothing beats main net implementation with billions of dollars on the line.
2. It allows BTC protocols and clients to be easily ported onto LTC.  This is evidenced by SegWit as well as how the lnd client has both BTC and LTC support.
3. It offers a secure enough network for those who are building on top of BTC to port their businesses onto LTC for cheaper transactions.  This was ultimately why Abra decided to add Litecoin as an underlying asset to its exchange.

Anyways, I hope this was helpful to you all and provided some context to the historical significance behind 5/10 and Litecoin activating SegWit.  In many ways, this was the date that Litecoin undeniably proved its worth to both the bitcoin and the cryptocommunity as a whole.  I will add UASF to my twitter handle as a way to commemorate it.

I've seen bitcoin specific websites but thought it will be easier for everyone if we can have a large database which will be filterable by each crypto. 

I've started with BTC, LTC and ETH but this will grow if/when the project grows.

Add your business now, and if you have any suggestions please comment and I'll see what I can do."
"Hi folks --

**(TL;DR I like altcoins, I would have been disinterested in crypto without Litecoin, and hope Dogecoin is overall good for Litecoin and the rest of the altcoin scene even though right now everything seems crazypants)**

I made a post here before, but I wanted to make a longer one after seeing a few Dogecoin related posts here (Then no more dogecoin topics, I swear! heh)


So, I got into cryptocurrency late July of this year, after reading a bit about it and about block size halving, and saying to myself ""Alright, I think I'm missing out on something potentially huge, I'm going to learn how to mine."" After fussing around and joining Slush's pool and mining for 5 days with my graphics card, I finally got 0.01 bitcoin -- the amount needed for the pool to finally pay out and get something in my wallet, and I proudly proclaimed on my facebook ""Huzzah, I'm rich. I mined $1 worth of bitcoin. And it only cost $3 of power."" I would have stopped, except that I found altcoins like Litecoin that I could actually mine and find whole numbers of, and thus I continued.


I get really irritated when people say things like ""Bitcoin is being undermined by all these altcoins"" and ""Altcoins take away from Bitcoin's value"" because to me, it's precisely the opposite. The regular person without a $5000 ASIC has nothing to mine without altcoins. There would be way less people into cryptocurrency if it wasn't for altcoins. Altcoins are paramount to bitcoin's success, and bitcoin is paramount to altcoin success. And, although I wasn't there for all of the history and growing pains -- when I got into it, it seemed pretty accepted and stable -- but I could tell that Litecoin essentially paved the way for all of that.


Anyway the reason I say these things is I sincerely hope that my happy accident Dogecoin turns out to be overall good for crypto. Yes, the alternate cryptocurrency forum looks a bit uh...Disastrous...right now, and some of the new people come from places where being obnoxious is more accepted. But, overall I think the dogecoin community has been very generous and well behaved, and from what I hear, similar to how the bitcoin community used to be before the coin value raised so immensely. 


I have no idea how long Dogecoin will remain at the popularity level or if it'll go up or down (or both many times), but what I hope is that it isn't seen as a threat to any altcoin, and can be seen as what I see it for - something that is bridging the gap between the complex, underground nature of cryptocurrency and something tangible that more regular people can play with and learn from. I think it is ushering a new lot of folks into the larger cryptocurrency scene (for which I feel the need to warn them of the potential perils at this point...). We all know how fascinating and exciting cryptocurrency is...I think it is great that more people can experience that, whether it be with Dogecoin or Litecoin. Or even Quark.

"Hello everybody,

Some time ago I posted warning about the danger of sending a BTC to an LTC address. I made the mistake of sending an entire coin to my Trezor's LTC address instead of my BTC wallet. I thought I had lost the coin forever.

Even though some people here doubted that was even possible and even called me a liar, most people were very supportive, with one Redditor even offering to send me 1 BTC because I was warning other people.

Luckily I did not have to take up on her offer and, with the help of some awesome people, I was able to recover my coin as soon as Segwit activated.

The customer support from Trezor was terrible, though. They simply refused to help me. I already ordered a Nano Ledger S and will never do business with Trezor again.

Here is the amazing guide that /u/btctroubadour wrote for me: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6sfnl2/segwit_has_been_locked_in_congratulations_everyone/dleu77d/
Hopefully this will help other people who might have done the same mistake I did. Also, it taught me a lot of interesting things about Blockchain.

It is also good to know that improvements are being made on the currencies so that such mistakes are not possible anymore. If I were not a techie, a situation like this would probably have kept me away from Crypto forever.

Thank you to everybody who gave me support. This is a great community and I am happy to be part of it."

Quite arbitrary datapoint I'll give you that but I have been noticing a massive uptick in litecoins being transacted over the past 4-5 days. Pretty interesting and I hope price will follow.

"I haven't been around the longest and I definitely don't own a lot of LTC.  What I have done is follow LTC and Charlie intently for a substantial amount of time.  I've spent more time observing and thinking than buying.  

For any newcomers who feel conflicted about LTC, Charlie, prices, etc., here's some advice:

1.  In a sea of speculation, over-valuation, hyper-mania, propaganda & uncertainty, you have chosen the coin that has always been stable, has always been dependable, and is a crypto OG.  While that might sound boring to many of us, it is the most exciting to anyone with big, serious money.  

2.  If crypto was a football game, we have just (maybe) ended the first quarter.  If you're in now, congratulations.  You might not have been here from kickoff (and neither was I), but you were still insightful enough to enter the game at an early stage.  Take a deep breath.  Close your eyes.  Don't worry about what's happening today or tomorrow all the time - start game-planning for years down the road.  When you dream, dream about the future, not about next month or next year.  If you have faith in LTC, playing the long game is necessary and it will give you peace of mind.  

3.  Diversify.  This not is only smart from an investment perspective, but it is also beneficial from a psychological one.  Put your LTC in a paper wallet, encrypt it with a password, consider it gone.  Look at it like bars of silver you buried in your backyard.  After you do that, go ahead and research other coins and ""play around"" a little.  That way you can have fun with everyone else in the short term while also not making a mistake and impulsively blowing the Warren Buffet of your investments. 

4.  Charlie is a gift, just not the gift you always want him to be.  He will have you fired up when he hypes LTC and when he comes out with cool updates.  He will piss you off when he seemingly hates to see LTC shoot up in price.  He is often conflicting.  Rather than being mad one day and happy the next, try and figure out why you feel that way.  What is he doing/saying that makes you feel that way?  Why is he doing it?  When answering these questions, don't think about yourself or Charlie; think about LTC.  What benefits LTC?  Is it price stability when potential businesses are considering implementing it?  Is it growth when LTC needs marketing?  How does each chess move work to compete against competitors?  Think big, think long term.  Charlie is.

5.  Don't doubt yourself.  You're here for a reason.  Your personality fits here for a reason.  If we all end up being totally wrong, fine.  But I'd rather go with what is in my gut and be wrong than ignore what was in my gut and realize I was right.  Have confidence.  "
"I'm not one to regularly contribute to this subreddit.  I've got litecoin, but generally as a hedge against the shenanigans of bitcoin.  It is, after all, a code fork of bitcoin with a few architectural changes like an increased block generation time, and an alternate PoW.  It has also directly contributed to the development of bitcion through things such as the UASF proposal.

When I listened to the testimony of the SEC chairman and CFTC chairman at their senate testimony the other day, I recognized that there were so many things that need to be understood in the crypto space.  It is really important to listen to Jay Clayton, and his understanding of the overlap between ICO's and securities.  Here is him explaining just exactly what he's responsible for regulating :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7VWYOEmQM&t=45m32s

Now that Charlie Lee, the creator of the LTC, has sold his stake, and is still involved in the advancement of the protocol, it means that the definition of a security, as I see it, no longer applies.  Lee now has no direct stake in the 'stock' of the instrument.  

This type of language by the SEC chairman should send chills down the spine of any ICO controller :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7VWYOEmQM&t=70m29s

> ""I'm very unhappy that people are conducting ICO's like public offerings of stock when they know that they should be following the private placement rules.  Those ... things make me unhappy.  To figure out how to deal with them is why we're here.""

And this :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7VWYOEmQM&t=73m59s

> ICO's that are securities offerings?  We should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings.  End of story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7VWYOEmQM&t=75m20s

> The people who wrote 'The 34' and 'The 33' act, they were smart.  They did it on a principle basis. They basically said, if you're giving people money in exchange for the future development of a business, with the hope of a return ... it's a security.

> When they were written, there was a great recognition that there was a tremendous amount of securities activity in this country, and that we were going to rely upon gate-keepers, to help us enforce those, *and liability*, rules.  Accountants, lawyers, under-writers, sellers and the like.  I'm counting on those people to do their job.

What does that mean?  If you lose money on an ICO, you can sue them, and the SEC will support you in saying that the people who have stolen your money were doing so illegally.

If you have your money in an ICO knowing that this is the way they're viewed by the regulators, you're mad.

Litecoin doesn't have this problem anymore.  Bitcoin doesn't either.  Almost every other ICO that I know of does."
"With LTC being 45$ right now, that's 4.5$. Please make some thunder over this. Exchanges are starting to act like banks."
