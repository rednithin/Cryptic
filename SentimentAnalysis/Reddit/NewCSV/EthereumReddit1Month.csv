"Alice wants to buy Bitcoin for ether and Bob wants to buy Ether for Bitcoin

- Alice sets a price on the website and Bob likes the price and clicks get into trade

- Alice initiates a contract with the amount of ether set in, the price to bitcoin, Bob‚Äôs bitcoin address and Bob‚Äôs ethereum address, this could be initiated with an email saying ‚Äúbob would like to trade with you, click here (with bobs info auto filled into a web3 transaction)

- Bob sends the bitcoin to Alice, Alice sees the bitcoins arrive and waits for 6 confirmations or can even do it early if she is confident

- After six confirmations, Alice sends a transaction to the smart contract which sends the ether to Bob by a self destruct with bobs ethereum address as a parameter (self destruct will free up storage and result in a cheaper transaction).

Settlement mechanism: 

- If Alice never claims to have received the bitcoins but did, Bob can void the contract (after a set timestamp) and get the coins by providing proof of his bitcoin transaction with summa tx in the smart contract (a valid slice of at least 6 blocks of transaction proof). The smart contract is self destructed on his ethereum address. 

- If Bob never sends the bitcoins, he will be unable to void the contract and Alice can self destruct it back to her wallet (after the set timestamp) 

Requirements:

- Alice should only provide a fresh bitcoin address with no existing transactions 

- One contract, one trade. 

- Contract can only be instantiated when the trade has begun, this prevents Alice from making a contract in advance and waiting till it is nearly expired and thus self destructing the contract and getting the bitcoins 

- Bob must be certain the amount of coins he sends matches the amount (again can be handled with a simple payment QR code)

- A timestamp with ample time for a settlement to occur

- A bytecode matcher which only let‚Äôs bob enter the trade if the contract code matches what the contract is supposed to be "

"I was wondering how it works with EVM and Ethereum in comparaison to the EOS network where RAM and CPU are token-ownership (limited) ressources. So if I need to run a dApp on Ethereum with 100GB of data, is it technicaly possible? or maybe I'll need an additional layer-2 like the Loom Network? Thanks!"

"Hey everyone, just landed in Paris for the blockchain week, any advice on where to go first? (the program seems to be changing a lot, afraid I could miss smth big:)  

Would also appreciate any advice on chatrooms I should join.  

Also, where's the best place to eat around here? (price is a factor)  

Thanks for the info!"" "

"A solution just occurred to me about how to establish a registry of unique and private human identities in a public blockchain. It's not a solution I've seen discussed before and I'm starting to wonder why that might be. It's deceptively simple. Essentially, we could design an imitation game or stochastic challenge-response process (a Turing test complex enough to prove that each player is exhibiting intelligent human behavior), which would need to be played at a specific agreed-upon time and on a periodic basis (it wouldn't be a one-off mechanism, but an infinitely repeated game).

These conditions seem to ensure the uniqueness of each player as there would be no machine which could replicate a cognitively-meaningful path through the game and no way for each unique participant to play the game more than once simultaneously. In short, the successful completion of this game would earn the players a security token which they could then exchange for a private key to some registry of unique identity holders. I imagine this could all be designed in such a way that there would be no transitive connection between the digital and real world identities of the players.

Another benefit is the fact that this can be implemented in regular software without any expensive biometric hardware, providing high on-boarding bandwidth relative to other approaches. We're really talking about a kind of MMO-CAPTCHA with intermittent state updates to the blockchain. And who knows, this may even be an enjoyable and non-bureaucratic experience for the players. I realize this would be an extremely difficult engineering and social coordination feat, but is there any reason in principle this form of solution couldn't be feasible?

Very open to any thoughts, criticisms, resources, or projects along these lines."

"Tomorrow I'll travel to the biggest ETH conference in the EU and it'll be my first conference ever. I've been looking forward to it for a while now and the (amount of) speakers is simply overwhelming. Over 250 knowledgeable speakers will talk about their work/passion on the Ethereum network. I've made my personal list of the people I really want to see already, but I'm sure I've overlooked an interesting speaker or workshop.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question to you guys is, which speaker would you recommend this EthCC and why?**

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you attended the last editions of EthCC or some other conference like EthDenver; what was your experience and why would you recommend anyone going to these? 

And what about blockchain hackathons? In april I'll compete in the [Odyssey hackathon](https://www.odyssey.org/), the biggest hackathon in the world. That'll also be a first for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

"I know videos are frowned upon here and got my u/altcoinxp banned on this sub (which I would like unbanned, but haven't had time to write my argument for it yet), but anyway, videos are my best way I have to communicate my thoughts and saves me from having to type and rewrite over and over again and youtube lets me speak without worry of censorship. I don't really want to get into that here, just pls don't ban me and remove my posts again for sharing my thoughts.  
  
I've made arguments against ProgPoW and have yet to hear any valid counter-arguments to them. I'm also completely independent, not a miner, not involved with ASICs, I don't work for anyone, and I invested in Ethereum a long time ago and (other than some scraps from donations over the last year) it's the only crypto I hold.  
  
You don't have to agree, you don't have to change because of me, but please just hear me out, and if there are valid counter-arguments to my thoughts please speak up. I don't bite and am very much for civil debates backed by reason and evidence...

"*There are concerns that the use of non-fungible tokens  could end up becoming fragmented, with different standards and varying  degrees of certification.*

At the moment, as we  mentioned a little earlier, it can be an expensive and complicated thing  to achieve. It can sometimes take months to develop a DApp, and in the  fast-moving blockchain world, that could cost an entrepreneur their  competitive advantage.

Instead of every outlet  interested in non-fungible tokens creating their own framework (which  would result in a breeding ground for inconsistency,) some platforms are  trying to create a technological layer which unifies and standardizes  these tokens.

One of them is¬†[0xcert](https://0xcert.org/),  which offers a ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù framework which means that a  non-fungible token can be developed and verified quicker ‚Äì and the  platform claims it is achievable in days. The company says it eliminates  the need for in-depth blockchain knowledge, while stopping precious  data from being siloed and preventing developers from having a lengthy,  expensive and insecure process."

Thinking of an idea about building a future on the difficulty rate. Is this something the community would be interested in?

"Hello I have some questions

A distribuited ledger  will  it never perform as a  centralized one?  Or  is  it  a pipe dream?

Because last day  the  website  I used  went  down  for 1  hour  and this   is a  bad  thing  that  won't  never  happen  if the website  was  hosted  on a distribuited database.

On the  other hand  distribuited  data-base  and  D--apps  are an unpratical way of doing ''internet''... the  transactions  must  be  shared  and verified  by  all the  memebers in the network

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: will  we  ever  reach  the point  to have dapps  and  distribuited databases  which  that  performs  the same  way as  the centralized ones?

&amp;#x200B;

With  sharding only some nodes  on the  network (choosen randomly)  perform  the  ''verification task''  and no need to  download  all  the  historical transactions, so my question is:

&amp;#x200B;

can ethereum or   other  DLT  reach  the scalability level  of  Central databaseses?"

[removed]

Most apps I have only let me get notified at a certain price but I want just a scheduled price notification every 30 minutes. Thanks for the suggestions

"Hello! We are offering QA geared towards blockchain dapps. Our team is composed by Lucas, our QA analyst, and me, a web3 developer with almost 3 years of experience. DApps are a new field, and there are many ambiguous, gray areas in UI and UX. We combine expertise in the QA realm with a broad and solid understanding of the web3 stack.

If you're interested in sample feedback for your website (1 or 2 bug fix requests), drop and email at cehhiro@cehhiro.com.

We are looking forward to jointly improving the decentralized web. A few weeks back we audited LocalEthereum, and Michael was very pleased. We hope to help your project as well."

Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the process of fundraising capital. The ICO (Initial Coin Offering) model allows projects to bootstrap themselves without needing to go through traditional venture capital funding. More recently, STOs (Security Token Offering) created a way for **projects to tokenize assets** and give holders **equity** within the company.

However, crypto evolves quickly, and now there is an even newer funding model called the **IEO (Initial Exchange Offering)**. IEOs enable crypto projects to fundraise **directly on digital exchanges** themselves which is why they‚Äôre generating so much *buzz* lately. *Are IEOs just another passing fad, or are they a crypto trend that‚Äôs here to stay?* Let‚Äôs take a deeper look to find out.

[https://www.initialcoinlist.com/what-is-an-initial-exchange-offering-ieo/](https://www.initialcoinlist.com/what-is-an-initial-exchange-offering-ieo/)"





"You are a gift from the Gods. Your passion, commitment and hard work are deeply appreciated beyond comprehension. I cannot express the gratitude that I feel for living in a timeline with individuals as dedicated as in this one. When surly audiences cast their doubt upon you, stand strong, knowing that you care not for their pageantry, but care only for doing what is right, doing what is true, there's nothing else to do, if good is what you seek to do. Do not allow people who are unable to meet their own standards, to get into your head. Use your knowledge to rise above their FUD. Trust as few people as possible - only those who have truly proved themselves worthy of your trust, and even then, be prepared for those you trust to disgrace you. Be prepared for anything to happen. Do not let it make you falter, rather, take it up in flames and use it as fuel to burn your own internal fire of your desire. Virtue is enough. Thank you for your work.

I believe that Ethereum has given humanity the utility to effectively create platforms which incentivise cooperation and unity amongst individuals who comprise the userbase of said platforms. This is an unprecedented opportunity to seize the means of the new web-based economy in order to do what is right. We are in the middle of a financial revolution. All across humanity. The internet is a means of infrastructure that is effectively connecting the world into a singularity. That singularity is either going to be taken over by the good guys, or the bad guys. This is our time to stand up against the injustice that we are passively eating up every day of our godforsaken lives. **Enough**. This is the best chance that we could ever possibly hope for, to have the tools at our disposal to revolt against the despicable and swinish. How? By implementing sustainable energy infrastructure. By incentivising cooperation. By taxing the elites. Universal basic income schemes. Wholesome culture. Respect for work/life balance. Respect for virtuous values. Contempt for hoggery or stupidity. Why hold ourselves back? Why give in to our primitive desires? At least, ""why"" to the degree that we allow our primitive desires to become our main focus - this is degrading to the self, our primary focus only needs to be to do what is right, and what is right is whatever we consider as the virtuous decision to make in a given situation. I think that a *""more-sane""* version of gratifying our primitive desires is to allow virtuous efforts to bring our satisfaction to us. Doing this requires the alignment of what you consider to be gratifying, with what reality is confronting you with (it is possible for as long as you tell yourself it is).

I wanted to take a moment to give thanks to all of those who comprise this enterprise. The haters and the lovers. The yin and the yang. The fuel and the fire. I love every single one of you down to the core of your soul. Never give up the fight for what is right. The past has handed us divinity and it is up to us to preserve it. Up to us to live for it. Up to us to die for it. Memento mori. Protect one another, for we are all part of the same thing. There is nothing separating us. Spacetime connects us to each other. Spacetime itself is part of what we all together are. What we do to spacetime, we do to ourselves. There is nothing separating the spacetime we experience from our idea of our ""self"". The ""self"" is merely the manifestation of all spacetime that has been projected onto it. Without the ""outside"", there would be no ""inside"", and yet there are neither, as they are each one and the same. The logos permeates all, knows no bounds. Follow the guidance of your intuition, harmonise with that which you consider to be ""right"" (always open to correction from the truth).

For freedom, virtue &amp; one another.

I love you."

"There's a complete need for a solution to take away currency pegged stablecoins and lack of stability in merchant proceeds. As, there one of the currencies in a two-pegged stablecoin receives instability, and merchants are at high risk of losing their revenues. These two issues can be solved with the properties of water and also the existence of a joint nominal value and token balance: eventually there will be a project that takes this on.

here is the research white paper, currently not an ICO:

"SendCrypto Bot now has beta support for Telegram.

https://i.imgur.com/FBXbqT8.png

To use it, invite [SendCryptoBot](https://telegram.me/SendCryptoBot) to your group and use one of the trigger commands:

`/pay @Alice $1`  
`/pay @Alice $1 ETH`  
`/pay @Alice 20 REQ`

Once the payment is complete the bot will post a message in the group to confirm, as well as DMing the sender and recipient.

The bot runs with [Privacy Mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) enabled, which means it only sees messages directed to it with the `/pay` command.

DM the bot with `help` for more info.

This is a fresh launch so there might be bugs."

"Hey everyone, the topic mass adoption is beside technical thoughts and partnerships something I think about a lot. In the last time I see more and more games on the blockchain appearing. I am a big SciFi and cyberpunk fan so one games caught my attention especially. I wrote an article about it.

But I also wanted to ask which other games you know? Where do you see potential and how can the gaming industry bring more value?"

"Hi. I don't know if this idea has been pursued or not, but I was thinking of a way to bring Ethereum transactions to those without internet access. I'm thinking about using [mesh networks](https://www.geckoandfly.com/22562/chat-without-internet-connection-mesh-network/).   


Is this idea plausible? It would only make sense in highly populated cities (as the range is limited).  And I know it's not really practical, because public WiFi is relatively common. I just don't know if it's technically possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is that users with an internet connection act as a hotspot for users without internet access (over radio) which are nearby. Would it be possible for offline users to send/receive transactions over a p2p radio mesh network?"

Anyone know if there is a documented dictionary of field names/descriptions for the log output of geth?


"I am not anti-Parity (so please, spare me the ""Parity has done a tremendous amount for Ethereum"" ... I know that).

*But I am pro-economic incentives.* And rational, unemotional economic incentives should be something many around here understand (or at least try to), given that they are critical to the operation of cryptocurrency blockchains.

So let's just look at the incentives: As the primary developers of Polkadot (with many of their devs holding a substantial amount of DOTs), Parity has a *huge financial incentive* for Ethereum to fall behind on its Eth 2.0 and Eth 1.x roadmaps.  If Ethereum does fall behind, it provides Polkadot with more of a chance for Polkadot to become more prominent for certain use cases- either by seizing existing market share of Ethereum, or to expand the market in ways that benefit them (perhaps before Ethereum could do so).  Such a situation would inevitably boost the value of DOTs.

There may be room for multiple projects in this space, but a big part of Ethereum's value proposition is having a critical mass of activity upon it (via L1 and L2).  Fragmenting economic activity across multiple networks is detrimental to that important network effect at this point.

Polkadot claims to be complementary to Ethereum, *but how*?  I mean *really* how, not ""hand-waving and hugs"" how.  What value are they adding to Ethereum that L2 and Eth 2.0 can't achieve?  Is their only value that they plan to be interoperable with Ethereum?  If so, I see how this benefits Polkadot, but I do not see how it benefits Ethereum.  If they really wanted to complement Ethereum, why aren't they launching as an L2 upon it?  Why does Polkadot need to be an L1?

What are ways in which these financial incentives might be counter balanced?

1) The holders of DOTs also hold *a lot* of ETH.  But this is not perfect, as DOTs with a relatively small ICO valuation (compared to current ETH market cap) *may* have easier accessible upside.  In this way, holding an equivalent amount of ETH to DOTs (in fiat-terms) could really be viewed as an insurance policy against Polkadot failing.
2) Polkadot demonstrates how it really is a complement to Ethereum, and not just a leech upon it.  I don't know how, but they need to show that they are dependent upon Ethereum's success in order for them to succeed.  So far, I do not see this vision.

Sorry, those are just the facts (as inconvenient as they may be).

I don't know what to do about them, but ignoring potentially perverse incentives behind one of the most important Ethereum development organizations is probably not the best approach.  Not everyone is going to win in this market, and seeing a potentially VC-controlled coin with on-chain governance as a big winner is not something I really care about.  That's not why I became interested in this space in the first place."

"Hello buidlers and ETH fans alike, I hope you're as excited for ETHDenver as I am. Development is at an all-time high and it's never been more exciting to be part of this decentralized world. Keep on buidling!

![img](3x7r6jtz6sg21)

I'm writing to let you folks attending ETHDenver know that the development team behind the ERC-20 token XYO will be at the event and need YOUR help, as all these projects do. One of the things they want is the following: help them build out the user interface for onboarding a diviner, one of the key elements within the XYO geolocation network. It would be helpful to follow the [Payable on Delivery Demo](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/payable-demo/) prior to figuring out an onboarding process.

&amp;#x200B;

You did read that correctly; one of the things this project makes possible, running on ETH, is a payable-on-delivery smart contract. XYO actually demonstrated an example of this at their inaugural Spatial conference back in November, using a drone delivery system that only executed an ETH smart contract once the drone interacted with one of the real world XYO devices: [https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b](https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to all the developer tools they have ready for the conference, which includes a simple dApp deployment tool (dApploy) and a smart contract creation environment (dApper). It also lists all the developer challenges they are putting out there and is a treasure trove of resources: [https://developers.xyo.network/](https://developers.xyo.network/)

Also take a look at their color coded papers to fully understand the network here: [https://xyo.network/research/](https://xyo.network/research/)

&amp;#x200B;

Make sure you don't miss the Proof of Location panel Saturday morning 10:10-10:45 on the Bufficorn stage to learn more about the grand vision. Arie Trouw (CEO of XYO), Marcus East of National Geographic, and Cameron Schorg of DISH will be speaking about all the possibilities this technology can bring to the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, and thanks for bearing with me, also check out XYO's new app COIN, which enables real world geomining. Available on iOS and Android: [https://coinapp.co/](https://coinapp.co/)

If you like what you see, keep up to date with XYO on their subreddit [r/XYONetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/XYONetwork) , follow their updates on their Medium blog [https://medium.com/xyonetwork](https://medium.com/xyonetwork), and most importantly, HELP BUIDL!"

"According to Preston Vanloon (of Prysmatic Labs), Serenity will have 1024 shards, 111 validators per committee, 113,664 validators (at the start), and 3,637,246 ETH locked up (at the start). 

Assuming an Ether supply of 110 Million post-Serenity, it appears only 3.3% of all Ether will be able to participate at the beginning of Serenity. The ""number"" of validators, then, is highly misleading since users with vastly larger sums of Ether will dominate the probability distribution due to stake splitting. So, for example, users with 100,000 Ether will have 3,125 opportunities to be selected, compared to the baseline average, which is likely a single user with a single opportunity to be selected, due to having only the bare minimum of 32 Ether. Accordingly, we don't know how many ""unique"" validators there will be, as those with the largest shares will radically out-compete the little guys. This seems especially problematic given how a single computer can run multiple validator instances, which reduces key obstacles for larger stakers.

Based on these rough estimations, it seems to me the validator pool, while seemingly quite large to naive observers, will in reality be extremely narrow. That is, one could easily imagine there being less than 100 unique persons controlling the consensus process; considering the pseudonymous and starkly unbalanced nature of the coin distribution at genesis.

While I understand these limitations may only be ""at the start"", and greater participation might be possible later on, that doesn't actually reassure me. Regardless of how one massages these numbers, the fact remains that the vast majority of users will be unable to participate (in a fair manner) in the consensus process. I find this to be an unacceptable trade-off. Don't take this the wrong way, but this seems like a serious flaw and likely vector of centralization in the present design. 

Am I reading this situation accurately? If not, why not? And if so, what are some pragmatic solutions to increase to actual success rate of participation in a post-Serenity world? I'd appreciate an open and critical discussion on this topic."
"for those who don't know Hacker News is \*the\* tech news forum. Every other day there is a ""how much I hate blockchain and it's useless"" article.

This is in weird contrast of what the ""leaders"" of Silicon Valley think. Being more specific Y Combinator is pro-blockchain and so are many of the big VC funds and community leaders.

Can we give some attention there and participate because it's the developers that need to start building and they need to be convinced of the benefits."

" Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working for some months during my spare time on a project that aims to grow funds for anti-aging research institutions. I am building a trustless platform where contributions get rewarded with ethereum tokens that in the event of a patent or treatment being discovered could be used as currency for production rights over patents or to pay for treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe it benefits everyone involved and that with proper exposure it can get many funds from the crypto world to anti-aging research.

"COIN LION ANALYSIS

&amp;#x200B;

ICO Date Dec 2017

ICO Price: $0.15

Ticker: (LION)

Total Supply: 159,698,831

Circulating Supply: 79,849,416

Current Token Price:  $0.02

Market Cap $764,000

ICO Date Dec 2017

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 

&amp;#x200B;

New exchange that has been in development for 1.5 years is preparing for soft launch on April 1st. It is US based, fully regulated, bank account integration, fiat trading. Portfolio Management meaning you can copy a successful trader‚Äôs/whale‚Äôs portfolio at the click of a button. The token interacts with the platform by allowing for fee free trading and access to research, information and portfolios. There will be a rich UI allowing for easy checking of portfolios proven track record etc.

&amp;#x200B;

CoinLion Summary of Features and Selling Points:

&amp;#x200B;

This is a cryptocurrency trading platform, allowing offering not only traditional exchange functionality but a deeper more robust service with advanced trading tools more familiar to traditional markets.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be portfolio management with a rich social and community element that rewards successful traders who wish to share their portfolios and research for a fee to other users. Less experienced traders can choose to pay LION to access portfolios and information from successful traders. No YouTube / Twitter shills with masked success. Everything will be integrated into the platform it's self with traceable history of success and failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything will be US based and fully regulated. By choosing this route, Coin Lion will be able to offer direct bank integration, USD trading and improved insurance and security. Many people are uneasy with the companies that intentionally avoid regulation by hopping between nation borders etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The ICO took place around the peak of the Bull Market and has since had to develop away in quiet during this long Bear Market. The original timeline was too optimistic but thankfully the market has been quiet and it allowed the team to work harder on a better product. The Soft Launch will be the first step in getting the platform out to the public. Not all features will be there at launch, but they will be added over time.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many attractive selling points about this Exchange. One of the most important is being based in the US and fully regulated. This is huge to many investors who value security over anonymity.

&amp;#x200B;

If you compare CoinLion to other exchanges and their respective tokens you will see the potential is huge. Also, the price is currently way below ICO, mostly due to the unfortunate timing of the ICO being during the peak of the Bull market, which makes it an even better opportunity.

"So we all know security is so difficult with all the zero day exploits and skids out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently the Parity attack vector was exposed as leaving not just rpc users vulnerable but anyone with a poorly configured router.

&amp;#x200B;

It occurred to me how the emphasis on making people responsible to harden their own network was glazed over in favor of coding something less susceptible to what is commonly found in the field as the network security equivalent of what we use to strain boiled pasta.

&amp;#x200B;

I've outlined some simple steps one can take below to seem a less inviting target.

&amp;#x200B;

**1**) If you must use your ISP provided kit as a wireless gateway and modem, at least minimize the scope of your WiFi range. There is no reason to project a 2.4GHz signal in a 3 block radius when a 5GHz signal at half strength will reach every corner of your home and slightly beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

**2**) The more common the hardware the most likely it's been disseminated for exploits that are readily available to apply. It's best to have a router that routes, a WAP that handles wifi and switches that will expand your network. Small office commercial grade stuff is what you want.. and even then ensure you change the default login credentials. You would be surprised how many don't heed this advice. Change your IP (i.e. if you normally access [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) over http try to enable https connections to [192.168.2.42](https://192.168.2.42) over port 88 instead. Also don't just change the password but the login name as well, every little bit helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3**) Ensure remote logins are disabled, disable uPnP if at all possible, and forwarding, and set your DNS away from what your ISP uses to the more secure OpenDNS ([208.67.220.220](https://208.67.220.220), [208.67.222.222](https://208.67.222.222)) Google ([8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8), [8.8.4.4](https://8.8.4.4)) or Cloudflare ([1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1), [1.0.0.1](https://1.0.0.1)) servers which will help mitigate mitm attempts.

&amp;#x200B;

**4**) Keep your firmware up to date, enable your router firewall.. also ensure your PC has a firewall installed. Instructions for debian or ubuntu users below.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding a very basic iptables firewall as root:

&amp;#x200B;

    #apt install -y iptables-persistent
    #invoke-rc.d netfilter-persistent save
    #service netfilter-persistent stop

&amp;#x200B;

now edit rules.v4 at /etc/iptables/rules.v4 to read:

&amp;#x200B;

    *filter
    # Allow all outgoing, but drop incoming and forwarding packets by default
    :INPUT DROP [0:0]
    :FORWARD DROP [0:0]

    :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
    :POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
    COMMIT

&amp;#x200B;

and edit /etc/iptables/rules.v6 to read:

&amp;#x200B;

    *filter
    :INPUT DROP [0:0]
    :FORWARD DROP [0:0]
    :OUTPUT DROP [0:0]

&amp;#x200B;

Then you will want to go ahead and restart and initialize the settings you laid out

    #service netfilter-persistent start
    

**5**) Linux users can also take advantage of some options available by adding the following code to /etc/sysctl.conf

&amp;#x200B;

    # Reboot machine in the event of a kernel panic.
    kernel.panic=10
    
    # Ignore erroneous broadcasts, packets and redirects
    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1
    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0
    net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route=0
    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
    net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
    net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects=1
    net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects=1
    
    # Avoid traffic intended for routing
    net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
    net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
    net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
    
    # Harden against spoofing, log attempts
    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
    net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1
    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1
    net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians=1
    
    # Fix against RFC 1337 TIME-WAIT vector
    net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1

Then have these changes immediately take effect with the following as root:

&amp;#x200B;

    #sysctl -p

This is all pretty basic stuff but I hope these tips come in handy for some here.. Keep using secure code but ultimately maintain responsibility for at least trying to secure your own network as well.

"Hey folks, I've been trying to get an Azimuth point up at Opensea and have gotten an error. Their team says an Ethereum Node outage is effecting users in the PNW (going on days  now). 

I honestly know very little about nodes and how they effect users across geos. 

Is this outage effecting anyone else? Is there any resolution? "




"/u/DCInvestor recently made an [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ar2xxh/on_the_economic_incentives_of_parity_for_ethereum/) about the incentives of Parity, but I was disappointed by the comments. As someone who has taken pride in the community's collaborative and accommodating nature, it was heartbreaking to see people immediately reach for their pitchforks about Parity. It gave me flashbacks to how the Bitcoin schism started. Can we do better job as a community to have even-headed discussion? 

Like /u/DCInvestor, I'm also not anti-Parity. I respect what they've done for the community. I also hope that they can continue to contribute as they have done so willingly in the past. Like /u/DCInvestor, I work in an industry that requires thorough disclosures and avoidance of conflict of interest, so I understand the need to align incentives between parties in the market. I also empathize with those frustrated about Parity recently. It's unfortunate that /u/5chdn has made strident remarks against the ETH2.0 roadmap and that Parity has been the source of some recent bugs in software.

That being said, I believe we're actively destroying the community when we're holding up Parity and its developers to a paragon of virtue that will never be realistic. Once we start the Salem Witch Trials for anyone who has any hint of a conflict of interest, we will have no community left. We will become like Bitcoin Core all over again. 

Here's the unpleasant truth: conflict of interest will always exist, especially in a community like Ethereum that espouses to not be chain-maximalist. Don't hate the player; hate the game. We've always ENCOURAGED projects like Polkadot and others like Cosmos. If you want to give Parity crap about starting Polkadot, you also have to start questioning the community's values for a multi-chain future. In fact, many of the comments in the attached thread did exactly that. 

Now, I believe it's fair to be skeptical of this approach, especially when naively following it will encourage bad actors, but I also think we need to keep in mind why we created this approach in the first place. It comes down to innovation. Innovation in the Bitcoin community ground to a halt when people began branding every alternative take as a shitcoin. Conversely, research in areas adjacent to Ethereum has exploded because we've continually welcomed teams like EOS, IOTA, Cosmos, and Polkadot to build ERC-20 tokens on top. Their research, successes, and failures will benefit Ethereum just as Ethereum's scale benefits them.

Another unpleasant truth: the ETH2.0 development is still extremely experimental and fraught with risk. ETH2.0 developers and the EF may have a clear vision about Ethereum's future, but there's no guarantee that it'll come to fruition. What if the current sharding spec fails and we have to redesign it? Wouldn't it be better to have adjacent experiments with concrete results that can point us in the right direction? 

I believe many people here have an incorrect perspective of research-driven projects. Ground-breaking research flourishes an open and accepting environment for competing visions, not with a couple of researchers burying their heads in a problem with monomaniacal focus. And let's be honest: Ethereum needs the research just as much as everyone else. 

It's easy to accept these principles when Ethereum is doing well, but it's most important to accept them when Ethereum is not doing well. And yes, Ethereum has not had its best few months lately, at least in the court of public opinion. The delay of Constantinople, continued stagnation of price, and concerns about roadmap completion have made it hard to stick to our open-minded philosophy. However, this does not mean we should push our frustrations on developers and hold them to unrealistic standards. 

One final uncomfortable fact: Parity is not the only one with conflicts-of-interest. Vlad Zamfir sits on the board for RChain, a separate blockchain with no affiliation to Ethereum. He presumably has a big stake in RChain, and he's also been critical of Ethereum in the past, calling it shitty software. Wouldn't he stand to benefit if Ethereum fails as well? Ethereum's research partners for Zk-SNARKS have Zcash. Could their work with us merely be a ploy for further PR on Zcash? I bring up these examples not because I think there's a ""slippery slope."" This is a logical fallacy. 

I bring these examples up because I believe the most productive line of conversation first starts with revisiting our community values and standard of ethics before we give Parity a fair chance at explaining themselves. As we consider Parity's position, we need to apply their standard of behavior to all the other people who are not ""under trial."" We don't want to set bad precedents that then lead us down the dark road of radicalization. Parity also deserves the benefit of a doubt because they've contributed to the community for so long even before the $5M grant. They're the #2 node software for a reason, and we can't neglect that fact when we consider their case. 

One last tangential note: I recently read about Russian strategies to destabilize communities on social media.  Apparently, one of their favorite strategies was to log onto their site and post very radical statements that supposedly support the community (e.g. on a anti-Trump site, they might spam messages that Trump is a fascist). These statements would disgust the more moderate members of the community, leading the community to fracture into smaller, less influential elements. I bring this up because we're essentially doing the same thing to ourselves right now. By accusing Parity and folks like Afri of a conspiracy without conclusive evidence and due process, we're nothing better than a mob looking for a witch to burn. 

I think we can do better than that. I'm sure you do too.

"1) Switch to PoS.
2) Have the EF stake."

"So not too long ago I made an account on the exchange crex24. For some reason I had hundreds of shares of a token called Thorecoin (THR is the symbol) on said exchange. This token was valued at around 30 cents during this time. Unfortunately,  I had a student loan that needed a payment to be made so I cashed out THR for a couple hundred dollars to cover what was needed. Here THR is a few weeks/months whatever later and one single share is $500 dollars?!! I feel sick that I would have had a few hundred THOUSAND dollars as opposed to just a few hundred dollars if it wasn‚Äôt for needing immediate cash.  

Did I miss an opportunity here or is this too fishy where Crex24 would never have let me see this money?

Thanks. 

"


"It is in my opinion that the next big financial crisis will likely be due to the surmounting student loan debt (or maybe auto loans). This post is not intended to explain why this potential crisis will arise, or even what will happen... but more of a ""how can we/blockchain help stop this"". In short, are there any ideas or protocols being explored or built that aim to tackle this challenge? 

Personally, I have no idea (well maybe a few wild ones) of how defi could potential thwart this upcoming disaster, but was curious to hear from the community.

"Over a year ago [Christian Lundkvist](/u/christianlundkvist) came up with a very elegant idea for a simplified, rock-solid multisig wallet:

[exploring-simpler-ethereum-multisig-contracts](https://medium.com/@ChrisLundkvist/exploring-simpler-ethereum-multisig-contracts-b71020c19037)

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago Mr. Lundkvist updated his MultiSig Wallet contract to comply with EIP-712 (standard for signing typed, structured data). I haven't seen any user interface front-end for the updated contract, so I put this one together.

&amp;#x200B;

The user interface is spartan, but functional. In particular it has the following

functions:

* create/deploy a wallet with just a few key-strokes
* add/edit labels for the owner addresses
* save wallet data as a JSON string
* import a deployed wallet from the blockchain or JSON string
* create a simple transaction with just a few keystrokes
* sign a transaction (EIP-712)
* save/import transaction data (including any signatures) from/to JSON
* execute a transaction when there are sufficient signatures
* ens lookups where ethereum addresses are accepted

&amp;#x200B;

The ability to save transaction data as JSON seemed necessary to me, since different owners will need a convenient way to pass transactions around while collecting signatures.

&amp;#x200B;

The front-end is on IPFS:

[https://ipfs.io/ipns/simplemultisig.io/wallet](https://ipfs.io/ipns/simplemultisig.io/wallet)

&amp;#x200B;

and the source code (my fork of Mr. Lundkvist's repository) is on [github](https://github.com/AlejandroDiaz666/simple-multisig)

Cheers,

AD"
"Hey all, I am new to this forum, although have been using and developing (a bit) decentralised apps for 2-3 years now.

I am wondering how do people get tokens in the first place to start using Dapps? And how to you get your money back into Fiat after. Can you give examples from your personal experience? Dapps usually assume that you have some kind of tokens in the first place - do you guys see this as a problem?"

"Last year (2018) a group of doctors saw Ethereum as a goldmine and started an ICO. They accepted seed round funds and promised funds would be used for development of their Telemedicine platform. They immediately hit a speed bump with the ICO collapse, but continued to promise that the further rounds of investment would take place once they ""had clarity regarding the laws regarding fund raising"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions arose from investors as to the legality of the platform and regulations, but were always shot down as the founders were ""Doctors"" and knew what they were doing. Delays continued and founders made Augur bets on minor development goals to ""prove things were on track"". When challenged with the ethics of using investor funds to gamble and multiply funds, they removed any mention of doing so. Then things continued... delays, excuses, and messages/communication slowed to a trickle.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2019. In January, major investor revolts started to bubble up in the Telegram group, and user numbers dropped daily. There was 0 trading volume on their own protocol despite claims of activity from the founders. As of March 9th, the founders muted the Telegram group and sent emails to those who  invested saying that they ""will reimburse investors in the currency of  investment"".

&amp;#x200B;

This reimbursement is based on Ethereum, paid to the founders in 2018 at price highs and now depreciated to less than half of the original value. The founders are licensed medical professionals in the US, US citizens, and are hiding behind a company formed in Malta as a defense for their liabilities. The website for the project is [https://medcredits.io/](https://medcredits.io/) and the founding partners can be found at : [http://medcredits.io/team/](http://medcredits.io/team/)

&amp;#x200B;

This post is not made to start a mob rush, but to provide a repository of information for those who invested and now have no means of contact. Before taking any action, seek legal counsel, as this will most likely require SEC action and filings.  


TL/DR: Freezing the Telegram chat and now ""refunding"" investors with  depreciated [~~#~~**ETH**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash) rather than giving their tokens or the money back. This is after a year's delay following a seed round... [~~@~~**medXprotocol**](https://twitter.com/medXprotocol) is making a bad situation worse.....

"Hi there,

So I have a Ledger Nano S since almost a year ago I think, but when I tried to update the device to Firmware V1.5.5, the usb cable got disconnected by accident and it cancelled the update ofcourse.

Now after unplugging and retrying I couldn't get back on my Ledger because it shows something called ""Bootloader"" on the device, now I took the steps explained on their website to fix this, ans after fixing the Bootloader problem a new error occured on the Ledger screen, ""MCU firmware not genuine"", so I tried everything they suggested on their website and send alot of emails back and forth with Ledger Support, but nothing seems to work.

So basicly I get the Bootloader error and after fixing that it gives me the MCU not genuine error, but I simply can't fix that problem.

Also, when I unplug the Ledger Nano S with the ""MCU not genuine"" error on screen and plug it back in I get the Bootloader error again.

I have tried literally everything suggested on their website, every step.

Also restarted the device in unsafe mode ams Deleted all apps on there, doesn't work, disabled my anti-virus and firewall, updated my usb ports and am not using VPN, also closed any unneccesary programs on my pc that could interfere with the Ledger. (all as suggested by Ledger support).

Again nothinf works and I keep getting these Bootloader and MCU not genuine error messages. 

Still unable to acces my Ledger wallet!

All of this because my usb cable got disconnected during an update.

I don't see this become mainstream when something so small can couse u to be unable to acces your funds...

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

"At its simplest, Ethereum is platform based on blockchain technology that allows the development of decentralised apps (dApps). Similar to Bitcoin in that it has a tradable coin, its purpose and capabilities change. Ether, the coin on the Ethereum platform, works in the same way as other cryptocurrencies, but it is also the fuel behind the network, meaning developers need to pay Ether for code execution.

"After reading this recent [article](https://www.ccn.com/mycrypto-ceo-toxicity-in-ethereum) by [@CCNMarkets](https://twitter.com/CCNMarkets), I have come to realize that to stand in solidarity with the rest of the Ethereum community‚Äôs call for a unified code of conduct, there are things I need to address myself, as the founder and CEO of MEW. Being public and transparent, without hurting innocent people, is important. It conveys our shared values and points the way toward a more cooperative community. Debate informed by the competition of ideas and quality of work must be what defines our community, and those ideals are undermined by false narratives and personal attacks.

I am disappointed that certain parties have perceived my silence as a weakness and have taken advantage of it to spread misinformation about my involvement with MEW.

Until now, I admit that I have been quiet, but steadfast in my ultimate pursuit of building better and more useful products and features that will enrich the Ethereum community in time. However, remaining silent while others are on the offensive truly does a disservice to my team and to the community I care very much about. Those that know me understand that I am a very reserved person by nature, but I can no longer permit false information about me and my company to be spread on various mediums and outlets. I feel compelled and encouraged in this action by the Ethereum Community‚Äôs Code of Conduct itself, which states:

  
&gt;‚ÄúWe encourage you to promote this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.‚Äù- [Ethereum Community‚Äôs Code of Conduct v1](https://hackmd.io/s/SkZ6ZV2UV)


I feel that the statements made by my former business partner and MyCrypto CEO, Taylor Monahan (/u/insomniasexx) in the CCN interview mischaracterize my involvement with MEW, as well as the reasons behind the end of our partnership and her departure from MEW. Throughout that difficult time, I remained dedicated to MEW‚Äôs vision and contribution to the Ethereum community at large. I also must clarify that past and present employees of MEW have always been paid by the company. No evidence has ever been brought to my attention that Taylor paid employees out of her own pocket, nor has that claim ever been made to me prior to the publication of the piece in CCN. Furthermore, there would have been no reason for anyone to use their own funds to cover payroll, as MyEtherWallet was well funded at the time.

The coding side of MEW was single-handedly programmed by me long before Taylor left MEW and started her own company. I have remained committed to the development of user-friendly Ethereum solutions, and today MEW is flourishing with three core products. All of them came to life since Taylor‚Äôs departure, built by a strong team that has been with the project for the majority (as of now, over a year) of its lifetime. We would not be where we are today without the hard work and countless late nights spent on building MEW by this team from early 2018 up until now. This is another reason why I refuse to sit in silence while my team and the company to which they have dedicated themselves are presented falsely and disrespectfully to the media and the community.

Moreover, I think it‚Äôs rather telling that most, if not all, of the developers from MEW's early team who continued work with MyCrypto after Taylor‚Äôs departure from MEW have moved on to other ventures, and are no longer with either project. I continue to wish these talented individuals the very best as they work to build great things in this space.

Finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that not just [@myetherwallet](https://www.twitter.com/myetherwallet)‚Äôs Twitter account, but any account that represents a company in this space, should be considered as part of the company‚Äôs brand rather than anyone‚Äôs personal Twitter account. Maintaining it in such a manner helps to boost user confidence, which is essential in our industry.

At the end of the day, we are all working towards improving the Ethereum ecosystem, and this purpose is beyond personal preferences, communication styles or complicated backstories. The image presented by the members of the Ethereum community to the wider world will have a tremendous effect on the adoption of the blockchain. Users and outside experts can‚Äôt have confidence in the transparency and integrity of our products if we don‚Äôt hold ourselves and our peers to the same standards. I am hopeful that this initiative to agree on and maintain a universal Code of Conduct will allow the community to focus more fully on bringing innovations to the blockchain technology ‚Äì which is what brought us here together in the first place."

"*EthArmbian \[1\] is a custom Linux image for the NanoPC-T4 ARM SoC that runs Geth or Parity Ethereum clients as a boot service and automatically turns the device into a full Ethereum node. It includes other components of the Ethereum ecosystem such as Trinity, Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm.*

&amp;#x200B;

*EthRaspbian \[2\] is a custom Linux image for the Raspberry Pi 2/3 that runs Geth or Parity as light clients and includes other components of the Ethereum framework such as Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm.*

&amp;#x200B;

*both images take care of all steps, from setting up the environment, to running the Ethereum software and synchronizing the blockchain.*

# Ethereum software installed

Both images include the following software:

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum node clients**

* Geth 1.8.23 (enabled by default)
* Parity\_2.3.8
* Trinity (installer script, only on NanoPC image)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum framework**

* Ipfs 0.4.19
* Swarm 0.3.11
* Raiden 0.100.2

&amp;#x200B;

**For further info regarding installation and usage please visit EthRaspbian README \[2\]**

## Features

As Ethereum ecosystem grows it seems that supporting the Ethereum network is not just about running a full node anymore. Other important components of the ecosystem need to run p2p clients as well and the Raspberry pi is a pretty good option to do so:

&amp;#x200B;

* There are lots of Raspberry Pis out there
* Huge community support
* Low cost and low power consumption

&amp;#x200B;

Raspberry Pi image features:

* Runs geth in light mode by default (Parity is included as well)
* Includes: Status.im node (runs by default), Raiden network node, IPFS and Swarm
* Based on Debian Stretch
* Automatically resizes the SD card
* Changes the hostname to something like ‚Äúethnode-e2a3e6fe‚Äù (HEX chunk based on the MAC hash)
* Binaries run as systemd services and are restarted in case any problem arises

&amp;#x200B;

The board may be useful for lots of tasks:

* As mentioned, it can support other key components of the Ethereum network (Swarm, IPFS, Status, Raiden Network)
* Run testnets
* Run private networks
* Use it as a development environment
* Run an Ethereum light node
* Other (Sidechains, Ethereum 2.0 tests‚Ä¶)

&amp;#x200B;

**Note: Geth (light client) and Status.im are enabled by default. It takes a few minutes for both clients to start running so give it some time.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Ethereum software update
* Fixed some bugs in update script
* Added Raiden as Debian package and Systemd service
* Updated Ubuntu packages

# Final remarks

Status.im \[3\] is doing a decentralization test on 1st April, so if you want to support the network, both images are a good option to do so. Download the image for your device (Raspberry Pi or NanoPC-T4) and flash it. Status.im is enabled by default in both images so you won‚Äôt need to do anything other than connect an Ethernet cable and power it up.

Most probably Geth will get an update very soon. I will upload the package right away and update the image as well (no reddit post).

# Special thanks

Thanks to the Ethereum Foundation for the grant \[4\], it is really appreciated.

Thanks to Bruno Skvorc for his insightful feedback with the NanoPC image. This helps a lot to fix bugs and improve the image quality.

"Is it really possible to maintain the PoW system in case of massive adoption? We are clear that Bitcoin is not going to change to PoS and we are also seeing that in some places mining is banned because of the harmful effect in the region: the rise in the price of energy, above all. Considering that now we are beginning to propose measures to avoid climate change, is it really possible to maintain PoW forever?"

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working for some months during my spare time on a project that aims to grow funds for anti-aging research institutions. I am building a trustless platform where contributions get rewarded with ethereum tokens that in the event of a patent or treatment being discovered could be used as currency for production rights over patents or to pay for treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am still tweaking the decentralised platform that manages the funds and based on feedback I might add or remove features.

"*EthArmbian \[1\] is a custom Linux image for the NanoPC-T4 ARM SoC that runs Geth or Parity Ethereum clients as a boot service and automatically turns the device into a full Ethereum node. It includes other components of the Ethereum ecosystem such as Trinity, Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm.*

&amp;#x200B;

*EthRaspbian \[2\] is a custom Linux image for the Raspberry Pi 2/3 that runs Geth or Parity as light clients and includes other components of the Ethereum framework such as Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm.*

&amp;#x200B;

*both images take care of all steps, from setting up the environment, to running the Ethereum software and synchronizing the blockchain.*

# Ethereum software installed

Both images include the following software:

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum node clients**

* Geth 1.8.23 (enabled by default)
* Parity\_2.3.8
* Trinity (installer script, only on NanoPC image)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ethereum framework**

* Ipfs 0.4.19
* Swarm 0.3.11
* Raiden 0.100.2
* Status.im 0.23.8 Beta8 Chaos (enabled by default)

# EthRaspbian image (Raspberry Pi)

## Download links

**For further info regarding installation and usage please visit EthRaspbian README \[2\]**

## Features

As Ethereum ecosystem grows it seems that supporting the Ethereum network is not just about running a full node anymore. Other important components of the ecosystem need to run p2p clients as well and the Raspberry pi is a pretty good option to do so:

* There are lots of Raspberry Pis out there
* Huge community support
* Low cost and low power consumption

&amp;#x200B;

Raspberry Pi image features:

* Runs geth in light mode by default (Parity is included as well)
* Includes: Status.im node (runs by default), Raiden network node, IPFS and Swarm
* Based on Debian Stretch
* Automatically resizes the SD card
* Changes the hostname to something like ‚Äúethnode-e2a3e6fe‚Äù (HEX chunk based on the MAC hash)
* Binaries run as systemd services and are restarted in case any problem arises

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The board may be useful for lots of tasks:

* As mentioned, it can support other key components of the Ethereum network (Swarm, IPFS, Status, Raiden Network)
* Run testnets
* Run private networks
* Use it as a development environment
* Run an Ethereum light node
* Other (Sidechains, Ethereum 2.0 tests‚Ä¶)

&amp;#x200B;

**Note: Geth (light mode) and Status.im are enabled by default**.

&amp;#x200B;

You can disable them by running:

`sudo systemctl stop geth &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable geth`

`sudo systemctl stop status.im &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable status.im`

# EthArmbian image (NanoPC-T4)

"This is going to be a post about cryptoeconomics. I hope the moderators will allow this to be posted to r/ethereum because cryptoeconomics is at the core of the success or failure of any decentralized crypto project, including Ethereum. I will discuss price but only in reference to the cryptoeconomic factors contributing to the success of Ethereum.

The motivation for writing this post came about because I have been hearing and reading a lot of people involved with Ethereum who seem to feel that price isn't important or needed for Ethereum to succeed. I even heard this sentiment stated by one of the main speakers at ETHDenver last month! I aim to show in this post that this viewpoint is very much incorrect, and that a high and increasing price of Ether over time is a critical component to achieving success for the Ethereum platform.

First of all, the very fact that ETHDenver exists is a function of the fact that there are thousands of people being paid to write code targeting Ethereum (wallets, clients, exchanges, smart contracts, vertically-integrated Dapps etc.) In some cases, the funding for those salaries comes directly from the millions of dollars investors made in the last price cycle, while in others it comes from VC and other investors building on Ethereum who are looking forward to future large-scale growth in Ethereum, mostly driven by growth of the value of Ether and other tokens running on Ethereum. This is the virtuous cryptonomic cycle, an increasing ether price brings more projects and developers which leads to more network effects and value to the entire ecosystem.

Secondly, Ethereum needs to do very well in the crypto marketplace to continue to attract future talent, investment, and network effects. If Ethereum slips to the #10 crypto asset, it will have far fewer people choosing to build on Ethereum, those projects and developers instead looking to build on platforms with better future prospects for becoming the global financial backbone for decentralized applications. 

Finally, a high price of Ether provides security for the Ethereum chain. It funds mining hardware and electricity in the PoW phase of Ethereum. And directly secures the chain in the proof-of-stake phase. Ethereum has the potential one day of securing a significant fraction of all digital financial assets on a single platform of sharded ledgers and smart contracts. If those assets are worth trillions of dollars, then Ethereum needs to be worth enough so that it is not viable to attack those assets by attacking the underlying Ethereum cryptoeconomic system.

To summarize, when some people in the Ethereum community denigrate Ether investors, say that Ethereum can work fine with the price of Ether at $10, and that a strong and growing price of Ether isn't important, they are way off base! The price of Ether is critical to the success of Ethereum.

This virtuous cycle also explains why the value of the Ether token is important to the entire Ethereum community, and why some people react quite negatively to attempts to siphon value from ETH and accrue it to competitors instead. Those attempts, if successful, will damage the future success of the entire community."

"Hey all, long time I did not post here.

&amp;#x200B;

I realised the project I am working on since last summer has never been mentioned on this subredit and thought you might be interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

[The Sandbox](https://i.redd.it/hez9ldls9hh21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

The Sandbox is a user generated content game platform using a minecraft style voxel world with voxel asset made by player themselves. We are aiming to launch a marketplace this year with the game client launching after that.

&amp;#x200B;

We have just released a blog post about the blockchain feature we use here : [https://medium.com/sandbox-game/blockchain-features-in-the-sandbox-7db91fcc615c](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/blockchain-features-in-the-sandbox-7db91fcc615c)

&amp;#x200B;

If you consider yourself an artist or know someone that do, check out our creator's fund : [https://medium.com/sandbox-game/were-offering-artists-2m-in-grants-to-create-content-in-our-new-the-sandbox-40dfc10cdc00](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/were-offering-artists-2m-in-grants-to-create-content-in-our-new-the-sandbox-40dfc10cdc00)

 

You can also test yourself already with our unique voxel editor at [https://www.voxedit.io/](https://www.voxedit.io/)

It allows you to create voxel asset and animate them.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also follow us on Telegram: [https://t.me/sandboxgame](https://t.me/sandboxgame) and Discord: [https://discord.gg/vAe4zvY](https://discord.gg/vAe4zvY) to ask any questions to our team and community.

"**Time:** 12 PM AEDT, March 8, 2019 (Sydney Time)

**Name:** Trevor Clarke‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVP of Product, Amberdata

**Topic:** Build Your First State Channel

**Brief:** In this workshop, we will be building a simple state channel. We will walk through the state flow, pros/cons of state channels and then create a state channel in solidity!

A State Channel is a scaling solution, where two or more participants can transact information in a trustless manner without forcing the transaction to be submitted to a blockchain between each transaction. This is achieved with a few pieces: multi-sig ‚Äúwallet‚Äù creation, inter-party transaction &amp; state communication, final state and dispute stored on chain.

Join the workshop and you will walk away with practical skills to use state channels in your next project!

"Evolution Planet is the first virtual planet game to use game asset management as a new nuclear game. It is also the first open platform and autonomous ecosystem based on blockchain, dedicated to blockchain game development, operation and resource integration.

&amp;#x200B;

two. Industry pain points:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The existing blockchain game is still driven by speculative psychology, focusing only on the money-making effect.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The game category is single and the playability is poor.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Mainly for digital currency players, it is difficult to attract real game users to enter.

&amp;#x200B;

The vision of the evolutionary planet: to achieve a new blockchain game ecology by connecting with other game system networks, blockchain games IP and Dapp zero barriers by means of cross-chain, sidechain, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: Bridging different games through cross-chain, sidechain, etc., creates a larger game ecology, which is the vision of many blockchain games. However, the current technical difficulty is relatively large, not only for the project team of the evolutionary planet, can we wait and see.

&amp;#x200B;

three. Game world view:

&amp;#x200B;

Evolutionary Planet's game world view is divided into geography, chemistry, physics, economics, and social views, and is constructed very reasonably.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Geography: The evolutionary planet is set as a planet with 26 continents, 24 of which contain 2025 (45\*45) plots, and the other two special continents contain 7921 (22\*360 1) plots. Block, the total number of plots is 64442 blocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: Compared to other sandbox games, the number of plots on the evolutionary planet is still scarce. For example, Neoworld, which has recently been on fire, has a total of 280,000 (7\*40000) land on seven continents. The setting of the evolutionary planet's official 26 continents is not easy. The original intention may be to access more public and external game ecosystems in the future, but the speed and method of opening up the mainland requires reasonable planning. The opening of the mainland too fast or too slow may affect the interests of players and the future development of the game.

https://i.redd.it/ker2pde729k21.png

&amp;#x200B;

2. Chemistry: It contains five basic elements: gold, wood, water, fire and earth. The properties of different plots are different, and the rate and number of generation of various elements are also different. The basic elements can synthesize higher-level composites with a certain amount of proportions, and the composites can produce higher-grade composites. The production and use of advanced props requires the same level of elements.

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: The setting of the chemistry concept adopts the five-line design in traditional Chinese culture. Compared with the setting of steel, wood and stone directly used in ordinary mines in Neowold, it is closer to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game world. Moreover, the five-line element superimposed composite certificate makes the props for the player's personalized development in the game more abundant.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Physics: Each plot is 100\*100 meters in size and has no height limit. In this parcel space, players can construct buildings. Due to the location and distance, evolutionary planets can be introduced to transport and transport workers.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Economic outlook:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) System pass model

&amp;#x200B;

RING is the system of evolutionary planet, with a total cap of 10 billion, the first mainland issued 2 billion, and the supply of the Xth RING is

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qzjvk1hh29k21.png

&amp;#x200B;

On October 10th, the official WeChat group of Evolution Planet announced the system revenue source and distribution plan:

https://i.redd.it/z9m77y2i29k21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: Evolutionary Planet uses the Bancor protocol for token exchange. Bancor everyone knows that unlike the original Ai Siou cut amaranth, both the user and the project side must have a human-machine transaction, a two-way exchange, and the evolution of the planet‚Äôs project is obviously More confidence in the project itself, but also dispelled concerns that players are worried that the project side will cut the leek directly. However, the release of RING takes the form of deflation on a continent-by-continental basis. This is somewhat unfriendly to the players who come in later. The release of RING on the A continent and the G continent is doubled. The final release of the mainland is only 8 million. . If the project side does not balance the progress of the project and the timing of the opening of the mainland, it is likely to affect the future attractiveness of the evolutionary planet.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Element resource pass model

&amp;#x200B;

The release of elemental resources will be determined by the parcel attributes (the release rate of the five resources) and the player's industrial activity indicators.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/uw09fpa039k21.png

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: Due to the evolution of the elemental resources release by the evolutionary planet, it is necessary for the landlord not only to pay attention to the reasonable matching between different elements, but also to pay attention to the rational planning of the building placement, so as to achieve the process of maximizing production. Optimization of the release of element resources. If you just build without a brain, the gains you get may be far below the optimal situation.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Composite certificate model:

&amp;#x200B;

The release model of the composite pass is completely dependent on the market supply and demand. The generation of the pass means that the corresponding number of elements are destroyed, and the destruction of the pass can bring the corresponding number of elements to be restored.

&amp;#x200B;

Box: A variety of basic composites, also the basic unit of the building.

&amp;#x200B;

Building: It consists of a square and a building model. The squares form part of the building and the building model represents the space design of the building. The building can be removed and restored to a square by paying a certain depreciation fee. When a building is worn, other players can provide the creator with a cloning fee to create the same building.

&amp;#x200B;

Props: Created by the mainland developers and defines the resources or benefits that the props can represent.

&amp;#x200B;

External props: Third-party blockchain game assets, props (such as encrypted cats) can also be connected to the evolutionary planet as a game prop of the evolutionary planet.

&amp;#x200B;

Transportation: The location of the resource or item with location information is transferred, and the handling fee RING is required for transportation. The farther away, the higher the handling fee.

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation: The setting of the composite pass has made the evolution of the planet become very diverse. In addition to the classic landlord and part-time play, you can get the benefits of RING by designing a personalized architectural model or other equity props. The traditional gameplay is too monotonous on the one hand, and it is easy to form conflicts of interest between players of different roles on the other hand. The choice of composite pass provided by Evolutionary Planet is conducive to building a more reasonable game ecology.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Social view: The user's account can be associated with a professional role at the same time, such as miners, exercise workers, construction workers, transport workers, etc. (the landlord does not belong to the system occupation). The specific occupation will obtain the productivity efficiency attributes such as proficiency according to the basic attribute addition, props, service age and other parameters. When the user changes the occupation, the new occupation has zero continuous time and low proficiency. Establish a credible voting mechanism by developing a scalable blockchain voting system.

&amp;#x200B;

three. game design:

&amp;#x200B;

The official white paper introduces the classic gameplay:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1msryra539k21.png

Interpretation: Players who have played games in my world and games like Neoworld may not be familiar with these gameplays. The landlords and migrant workers in the early bonus period are cooperative, and the income of both parties is very high. With the end of the dividend period, the income of both parties will gradually decrease, and after the number of landowners is saturated, the increase in the number of migrant workers will inevitably lead to the opposition between the two. After that, if the project party and the player can't increase the playability by developing other gameplay, the game's ecology may continue to deteriorate.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the resources and gameplay built into Evolution Planet, system developers or third-party developers can also access evolutionary planet games by developing a variety of game Dapps.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/krduq3sj39k21.png

Interpretation: At present, these peripheral Dapps are still in the concept stage. If the follow-up of the game ecology and the growth of user traffic continue to connect these Dapps to the evolutionary planet, that means that each of us can be in the world of evolutionary planets. Opening a bank, running a government, competing for an arena, etc., it is quite exciting to think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

four. Design Principles:

&amp;#x200B;

Minimize principle

&amp;#x200B;

2. Service API

&amp;#x200B;

3. Sustainable

&amp;#x200B;

4. Upgradeable

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xn2qy38k39k21.png

Interpretation: In addition to the technical architecture of the evolutionary planet, the official white paper also introduces the Darwin network and interstellar asset coding standards. Because these partial technical aspects are difficult for ordinary players to understand, and do not know and will not affect the game experience, so I will not go into details here.

" Cryptocurrency International Tanzania Limited is a globally renowned private limited liability enterprise located in the United Republic of Tanzania. It is one of the first organizations in Tanzania to offer its products in the financial technology sector. CITL eventually intends to revolutionize the global payment systems and transfer by leveraging blockchain technology. By integrating blockchain into the payment system the company has developed a dedicated decentralized cryptocurrency, denoted as Connect Coin (XCON).

## Connect Coin (XCON)

Connect Coin is a standard ERC-20 Ethereum-based coin developed to ‚Äòconnect the world‚Äô by streamlining the digital mode of payment and money transfer. XCON plans to empower merchants by facilitating them with a blockchain-based payment system known as Connect Pay to showcase and market their products and services. The company has also extended a global Connect Marketplace that allows consumers and merchants from around the world to efficiently take part in trading activities using Connect Coin.

### How Does Connect Coin Functions?

* Through Connect Coin, holders can obtain goods and pay for services on any global platform that accepts Connect Coin like Connect Marketplace, Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, etc.
* The Connect Coin owners can purchase goods and services directly from the merchants. By allowing global merchants to be part of Connect Marketplace, the platform aims to enhance the Connect Coin acceptability to over 95%.
* Coin Holders can exchange Connect Coins directly to fiat money or any other cryptocurrencies through Connect App.

## Connect App

Through Connect App, users can collect, send, and receive XCON from other users within the platform in real-time. The app also allows users to pay for goods and services to merchants around the world who accept Connect Coins. Within the app users can exchange Connect Coins to other cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, etc.

### Features of Connect App

Some of the essential features of Connect App include:-

* A Secure and reliable way of storing purchased coins
* Effortless to use and fast
* Low-cost transactions
* A simple means to pay for goods and services

## Connect Marketplace

Connect Marketplace is an advanced decentralized e-commerce network that has integrated distributed ledger technology. It is basically an extensive global market wherein verified service providers and consumers can connect with each other and transact safely via a single payment system.

### Consensus Algorithm ‚Äì Proof of Delivery

When packages are delivered to the concerned buyers, they have to confirm the delivery of the same through their signatures on the Connect Mobile App. This will ensure that the right package is delivered to the right buyer."

"On February 28, the Ethereum community received the hard fork it had awaited since a security bug delayed its implementation in mid January: Constantinople. But what is Constantinople exactly, and what does St. Petersburg have to do with it?

Below we discuss upgrades, Constantinople‚Äôs security issues, EIPs, St. Petersburg‚Äôs arrival, the ‚ÄúDifficulty Bomb,‚Äù and the reason behind it all; Ethererum‚Äôs quest to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.

Ok. But why we need it?

Simply a change in the Ethereum protocol: new rules that will hopefully improve the blockchain, and that require developers and the community to coordinate a smooth transition. This transition is necessary because the upgrade is, in fact, a hard fork: the chain will split into two, with the new branch living on, and the old, outdated one dying.

**#28**

**Speaker:** Felix Leupold @Gnosis

**Topic:** d∆íusion ‚Äî A Scalable, Fair Exchange

**Brief:** Centralized exchanges can be exploited by strategies like arbitrage trading or front-running. Today‚Äôs ‚Äòdecentralized exchanges‚Äô are solely non-custodial: trades are still settled via pseudo-continuous order books, reserving the ability to front-run and arbitrage trades. Introducing d∆íusion, a fully decentralized exchange that moves beyond these limitations. d∆íusion collects limit orders for many token pairs in discrete batches and clears all trades at the same arbitrage free price. It achieves scalability through the use of succinct zero knowledge proofs (zkSnarks). These proofs can be provided by all participants in the network removing the need for a single operator.

&amp;#x200B;

**#29**

**Speaker:** Brett Robertson @Ethereum Cat Herders

**Topic:** The Ethereum Cat Herders: Project Management in a Decentralised Ethereum

**Brief:** Ethereum has grown rapidly in the last few years and now has many branches working on different areas all for a common goal. As projects grow and develop they can experience some teething issues, most of which can be addressed by better coordination and communication. In a large open source, globally decentralised project of nascent technology, this can be hard. This exactly what the Ethereum Cat Herders are keen to address to help drive Ethereum forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**#30**

**Speaker:** Mo Dong @Celer Network

**Topic:** Build and Operate Internet-Scale dApps on Celer Network

**Brief:** Despite its high potentials, off-chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved. For example, how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on-chain operations? How to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off-chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks? How to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off-chain dApps? How to guarantee that off-chain states are always available for possible disputes?

In this talk, Mo will describe how Celer Network solves these challenges. Celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain dApps; and an incentive-aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off-chain state availability. He will provide their vision for Celer Network 2.0, a grand unification of all off-chain scaling technologies into a single solution.

&amp;#x200B;

**#31**

**Speaker:** Zeming Yu@Cover More Insurance

**Topic:**  An Introduction to Security Token Offerings

**Brief:** Zeming will talk about the use of ethereum within the security token offering space.

&amp;#x200B;

**#32**

**Speaker:** Michael Yuan	@Second State &amp; CyberMiles Foundation

**Topic:** Creating a Rules Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine

**Brief:** Smart contracts are immutable programs on the blockchain. They are automatically executed based on pre-defined rules. However, complex and inferencing rules could be extremely difficult to program, test, and validate, using standard programming languages like Solidity. The long sequence of highly nested IF / THEN statements is fragile and error-prone. The problem is compounded by the need to frequently change rules based on business requirements.

Past enterprise software vendors have long relied on Business Rules Engines (BREs) to solve this problem. BREs allow business analysts to write transactional (state changing) programs in a specialized programming language called formal rules language, which can be generated by graphical user interfaces. BREs automatically evaluate, re-evaluate, and execute those rules. They have been proven successful in traditional financial services.

With the Open Source Lity project, we have developed extensions to Solidity and the EVM to support a BRE for smart contracts. In this presentation, Michael will discuss the benefits and use cases of rules language and engine for smart contracts especially in the context of financial services applications. He will further describe how the rules language is designed and implemented, including compiler and virtual machine runtime support.

Who remembers what domain investing was like in the 1990s or early 2000s?

New digital real estate was being created from scratch and sold, launching an entirely new, purely digital, asset class. And as the internet filled up with new websites, premier domains began to shoot up in value.

Some companies in the .com era may have succeeded largely due to their domain and its primacy in search results. Today, this market has become stagnant, but innovation is popping up in a new area ‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääblockchain domains.

1. New domain extensions

If there‚Äôs one thing that blockchains are great at, it‚Äôs permissionless innovation.

New blockchain domain services can just launch on a public blockchain, no ICANN approval necessary.

2. Payments are native

Another thing blockchains are pretty great at is payments.

So what if I told you that your blockchain domain will replace your cryptocurrency addresses for payments? Rather than sharing your bitcoin, eth, and other addresses when you want to get paid, just share yourname.zil.

Now when I go into a wallet to pay you, I type yourname.zil, choose from a list of currencies you accept, and pay.

Not only is this is a way to replace long addresses, but it‚Äôs also a way to easily accept any cryptocurrency. If you just want to receive whatever currency is easiest for folks who pay you, then set up your domain so you accept all of the top cryptocurrencies.

3. Censorship resistance

With blockchain domains, the user stores the domain asset themselves inside of their cryptocurrency wallet, in the same way they store cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain domains are just assets on top of a [**smart contract**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-a-smart-contract/) platform like Ethereum. The only way to move a blockchain domain or change what information it points to, would be to control the private key of the wallet.

This is completely different than with traditional domains, where registrars like Godaddy &amp; Google Domains are the holders of your domain asset.

So the next step after domain custody is to make it easy to build censorship-resistant websites.

Right now, users could point their blockchain domains to content stored on a self hosted server or a decentralized storage network. That means that today it is possible to have both a domain asset and a website associated with it that can‚Äôt be taken down.

## Blockchain Domains Could Be a Much Bigger Asset Class Than Current Domains

This is due to:

1. **New features:** Payments and censorship resistance solve huge problems that exist with current domains, turning them into global, permissionless tools for business
2. **New users‚Ää:** Traditional domains are for businesses, but everyone will need a blockchain domain to pay and get paid. There‚Äôs a consumer and a business use for blockchain domains so we could easily see 3 billion instead of 300 million traditional domains.
3. **Portability:**‚Ää The entire current DNS infrastructure could easily port from the current centralized DNS registry to a public blockchain at any point in the future. Eventually, blockchain naming systems will be the tech of choice.

&gt;The Zilliqa Foundation is partnering with Unstoppable Domains to launch .zil, a new blockchain domain system. The system will launch on Zilliqa and is the first blockchain domain system to support payments in multiple cryptocurrencies, all to one domain.

Unstoppable domains is building domains on blockchains. Based in San Francisco, the company has received funding from Boost VC and grants from both the [Ethereum Foundation](http://www.ethereum.org/) and the [Zilliqa Foundation](http://www.zilliqa.com/).

When the system is launched in June, a public auction will begin for all remaining domains. Bidding starts at $10. Bids are public, and they must be at least 2% larger than the previous bid. The auction will take place on the blockchain, and anyone can participate.

At launch, .zil domains will support multiple cryptocurrencies. This means that users can add all their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zilliqa addresses to one domain. To pay, someone opens up their wallet, types in yourname.zil, selects from a list of currencies that your domain supports, and pays.

You can open your account here [https://unstoppabledomains.com/r/d6ee4241bb30494](https://unstoppabledomains.com/r/d6ee4241bb30494) and grab that perfect domain .zil name while its available.Cheers!"

4. Swap some of my other alts for ETH &lt;- That could have been an option but exchange fees are way too high for the purpose... And min to swap is usually set to $10.

"Last year GET Protocol announced multiple Ticket Sales on Blockchain and that 50,000 people will (unknowingly) have ethereum wallets by the end of 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Today GET Protocol announced another sale of 50,000 Tickets on March 2nd:

(Source: [https://medium.com/@olivier\_GET/update-february-19-6652f95efac5](https://medium.com/@olivier_GET/update-february-19-6652f95efac5))

&amp;#x200B;

""On March 2nd, we will have another big sale for Jochem Myjer. 

He recently announced an extension of his already quite unbelievable stretch of shows 

for his current tour ‚ÄòAdem in, adem uit‚Äô (Breathe in, breathe out). 

This means that upcoming Saturday, another 50.000 tickets will go on sale for these newly added shows. 

Building on last September‚Äôs successful sale, we will now get the chance to test our system again and 

prove that we are up to this type of scale."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Short reminder on how that looks like in real life:

[https://imgur.com/a/ppXUvSr](https://imgur.com/a/ppXUvSr)

&amp;#x200B;

Good-to-know:

Each smart ticket requires GET tokens as fuel. Event Organizers buy tokens from the open market via a buyback ([https://get-protocol.io/buyback/](https://get-protocol.io/buyback/))

A buyback is designed like a reverse dutch auction. The auction begins at 0.50‚Ç¨ per token and raises in a pre-defined schedule.

There have already been two successful buybacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding Ticket Scalping and Ticket Fraud GET Protocol has already proven its utility:

&amp;#x200B;

Jochem Mijer (one of the biggest dutch comedians) on his experience with GUTS Tickets and GET Protocol: 

‚ÄúProblem solved. Seriously, problem solved. First we ran some tests using GUTS, to see if it‚Äôs friendly for users, if it‚Äôs efficient, 

if it works. And now, if you calculate it, I sold 50.000 tickets for this show, in 2 hours, which in itself is pretty bizarre for a 

system that can handle it‚Ä¶ Not one! Not one ticket is up for sale for extortionate prices.‚Äù

"Yesterday, the [NFT.NYC](https://NFT.NYC) Conference kicked off in New York. There were almost too many talks to attend, and over 60 speakers devoted their time to a range of topics, both in panel discussions and in individual talks.

&amp;#x200B;

Jeremy Gardner [(Ausum)](https://www.ausum.vc/) argued that NFTs will be the catalyst for mass crypto adoption, and appealed to developers, especially those in the gaming industry, to solve the interoperability problem &gt;!(spoiler: the 0xcert Framework already does that)!&lt;.

Lou Kerner ([CryptoOracle](https://cryptooracle.io/)) claimed that FAMGA (a.k.a. Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon) has actually no community, whereas the crypto does, which gives it a significant advantage.

The graphic representation of the growth of the NFT market by Gauthier Zuppinger ([Nonfungible.com](https://Nonfungible.com)) clearly showed the growth potential of NFTs. Transactions have been increasing which is obviously a positive signal for NFTs, especially considering the effects of the bear market.

Cyrus Lohrasbpour, one of the first investors to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), recognized the potential of the artwork tokenized as NFTs since they hold characteristics similar to money and currency.

Urban Osvald ([0xcert](https://0xcert.org/?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=recap&amp;utm_content=nft.nyc%20recap)) talked about academic credentials harnessing the power of NFTs, a seemingly less attractive topic, but important for showing the variety of NFT applications and the potential for new business models.

[William Entriken](https://twitter.com/fulldecent), the lead author of the ERC-721 standard, held a workshop helping beginner developers explore and build effective and powerful smart contracts using NFTs.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, over 400 non-fungible aficionados in the audience and more than 60 speakers were taken very good care of made the event a boiling pot of non-fungible topics, minds, and projects.

&amp;#x200B;

We believe it's only appropriate to honor the effort and hard work of the event organizers. Every step of the event, they really showed their dedication and attention to details for both the attendees and the speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, a big thank you to the [NFT.NYC](https://NFT.NYC) Conference and Mr. Jodee Rich for the invite and their warm hospitality. Without a doubt, it was one of the greatest NFT events we've ever attended."

"The dapp environment is in its infancy, and so, the UI and UX models are also developing. I've teamed up with a senior QA to analyse and give feedback regarding dapp usability, while I assist as an translator to speed up the process, with 2 years of web3 stack experience.

Let us know if you're interested in a feedback demo for your dapp's website! Drop a DM or reach out to cehhiro@cehhiro.com.

The full process tests the complete UX that the enduser sees, as well as how well presented the UI is. You get a report stating what your current problems are, how to solve them, and a mockup where possible. For small to medium sized dapps, we take approximately 2 weeks to cover your needs.

Due to non-disclosure agreements, my QA teammate cannot disclose what websites he has audited before, but the 15 projects he has worked on receive upwards of 50,000 daily hits. He wants to start his own consulting reputation and I convinced him of taking this niche in crypto.

"The independent site [Popula](https://popula.com/2019/02/14/tip-popula-writers-today-because-you-can/) just launched [micro-tipping in ETH](https://popula.com/2019/02/14/tip-popula-writers-today-because-you-can/) directly to writers on all its article pages. 

For the first time, readers can send an ETH donation directly to an author's individual wallet address, entirely without leaving the article page, using the free [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser plugin and new pop-up UI.

This brand-new micro-tipping feature is a long-sought-after step in Ethereum-backed independent publishing, for support of local news and investigative journalism through decentralized micro-payments.

Previously, of course, readers have been able to send a small donation or recurring subscription to a publication or website. Now with this new widget, more Wordpress sites can embed JS pop-ups that quickly and easily sends ETH via MetaMask to a specified wallet address of that specific post's author (or a newsroom wallet) -

\- opening up new ways for site visitors to directly support content they value, and to open up channels for more personal relationships with creators. Micro-tips open up a new, richer new reader engagement metric to complement page-views, time on page, social shares, comments, or upvotes -  towards a continual two-way conversation with independent journalists, artists, and more. 

For new crypto users, there's a [How To Tip FAQ](https://popula.com/how-to-tip/), and more development coming with MetaMask. It's a smooth UX, so satisfying to send a buck to the writers whose content you appreciate. MetaMask folks, take it for a spin and let Popula know what you think. More development to come, this is just the start of opening new Ethereum-backed markets for decentralized curation and channels for membership engagement."

"As I've delved more into the economics of PoW and PoS, I've become increasingly concerned with that PoS is not a viable alternative. Most of the concerns are outlined here:

[https://www.yours.org/content/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-5437b3a591e7](https://www.yours.org/content/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-5437b3a591e7)

&amp;#x200B;

One of the key advantages to PoW is it incentivizes miners to advance their hardware to be as fast and energy efficient as possible.  As we all know, the problem with PoW is it also inevitably leads to absurd energy consumption because even as miners are rewarded for energy efficiency, new miners will enter the maker and increase competition until the cost of burnt energy is again just below the mining reward.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested to hear if anyone in the community has heard proposals to do a blend of PoS and PoW.  I've heard some discussion of changing what the task in PoW is. For example to change the task from a brute force, endurance task like current mining to perhaps rewarding short bursts of speed (a computational marathon vs a sprint). Can anyone point towards good write ups of possible solutions?"

"I am a believer in total supply market caps, instead of circulating supply market caps. And truth be told, market cap metrics are not that great of an evaluation tool for cryptos anyways. However, I know people like to see a total value number. Fair enough.

I've tried to spread the word and awareness regarding not using circulating supply, as circulating supply can be easily manipulated and deceiving. I personally view circulating supply market cap as a marketing technique for the crypto industry. Lots of folks use CMC and are not aware that its simply a joke to use circulating supply (IMO)

**Case in point: Grin**

CMC has it ranked at #193 

Messari (which uses total supply) has it ranked at #6!!!!!!!

So, if you judge a coin by its true valuation (total supply), then you are assuming Grin is a top 6 coin?! Me thinks I will SHORT the SHIT out of Grin (If I knew how to). However, most folks will look at CMC and see a coin with lots of room to grow, which it actually doesnt...its topped out. No where to go but down IMO.

Curious of what you all think about the discrepancy in market cap numbers for a coin like Grin.

Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

**#34**

**Speaker:** Guillaume Felley	@Liquidity Network

**Topic:** NOCUST: A securely scalable commit-chain

**Brief:** Commit-chains are layer 2 solutions to scale blockchains. He will present how commit-chains such as NOCUST operate in a trustless and secure manner while still allowing a large transaction throughput.  Such constructions are also an opportunity to fix some of the major user experience issues with blockchain.  Commit-chain transactions are instant and do not require to pay any gas fees.

&amp;#x200B;

**#35**

**Speaker:** Matan Field	@DAOstack

**Topic:** BUIDLing scalable DAOs

**Brief:** DAOs have long been hovering in the crypto minds and many believe 2019 would be the year we'll see some of them coming alive. We don't expect a one shape fit them all, but rather they'll likely to appear in different flavors and sizes. In this talk Matan will describe the BUIDLing blocks of DAOs, their architectural layers, governance modules and the holographic consensus protocol needed to push them up to large scale. I'll present Alchemy, an interface for generic DAOs on the Ethereum mainnet, and if the crypto god will be with me I'll also be able to present a real living DAO, baby but walking and talking.

**Speaker:**Peter Pan @MetaCartel

**Topic:**  State of the dapp ecosystem

**Brief:** We are entering a new inflection point in the Ethereum dapp ecosystem where many pieces of dapp infrastructure are now slowly emerging into viability along with the maturity of a steady and fast growing native user base of Ethereum dapps. We are slowly accelerating into a new period of experimentation enabled by a maturing ecosystem. We will slowly uncover the hidden mysteries of Web 3.0 and have another crypto kitties moment that will change how we understand the nature of Web 3.0

&amp;#x200B;

**#37**

**Speaker:** Parinya Ekparinya	@University of Sydney

**Topic:**   The Attack of the Clones against Proof-of-Authority

**Brief:** In this talk, Parinya will present vulnerabilities and countermeasures of Aura, a recently proposed blockchain consensus based on proof-of-authority. First, he will explains how the Aura consensus protocol actually works. Then, the presentation introduces the Cloning Attack and show how to apply it to double spend with a single malicious node.He will also discuss countermeasures to mitigate the risk of the Cloning Attack. Finally, the talk explains that the attack can be generalised to Clique.

&amp;#x200B;

**#38**

**Speaker:** Hannah Glass @King &amp; Wood Mallesons

**Topic:**  Why blockchain governance needs more than just a token

**Brief:** Blockchain technologies are evolving rapidly to refocus on technology-centric decentralised solutions. Many of these systems are governed by technological solutions, which makes sense in a tech-centric world. Significant work undertaken at the protocol layer is improving issues such as scalability and interoperability.

But whilst these solutions are technological in nature, the problems are human.  Scalability matters because people can‚Äôt make payments in crypto when they want.  Interoperability is a problem because it creates silos in an otherwise connected world.  Not to mention that applications are built to allow humans to store files, play games, make investments, and conduct a myriad of other activities. Purely technological solutions such as increasing block-size, creating wrapped tokens, and smart contract architecture, may improve upon the current situation, but are unlikely to solve these problems in all circumstances.  

The reason for this is because technology works well, until it doesn‚Äôt.  This is when governance matters most.

At its fundamental level, governance is designed to manage the interactions between people.  It may well be invisible in the usual course of dealings but must act as a safety net when things go wrong.  As those problems may be technological in nature, something more than just technology is likely to be needed.

This talk will examine how a co-developed technological, commercial and legal governance architecture can ensure that any solution is fit for purpose, robust and resilient, and enforceable even where there is a bug, flaw or outage.  Where problems are human, to too must the solution.

As Coin-telegraph explained  in an article looking at alternatives to ERC-20, advocates of this  token protocol believe it could become ‚Äúthe ultimate vehicle for putting  every significant asset on a public or hybrid blockchain with 100  percent immutability and security.‚Äù

Non-fungible tokens  allow you to detail more of the attributes that make them special ‚Äì far  beyond the name, balance, token supply and symbol. This is because you  can include rich metadata about an asset and include information about  ownership ‚Äì and these authenticated details can ultimately add value  because investors can be confident about its provenance.

That  said, there are downsides. Non-fungible tokens have not been embraced  as speedily as some advocates hoped, in part because the ERC-721  protocol is so new. It can also be tricky and time consuming to develop  decentralized applications for non-fungible tokens properly."


"Gnosis will fund 10 DAI-ETH auctions on the DutchX trading protocol to showcase how well the DutchX works for high volume orders. 

Each DAI auction will be worth 100,000 USD, so a total of 1,000,000 DAI will be auctioned off over the course of the #DutchXDAI run. ETH will be the token required for bidding. 

**What‚Äôs the opportunity here?** 

In these upcoming auctions, there will be no buy-back bot on the bidder side. 

This means that the auction will keep running until the whole volume is bid upon. 

This will enable participants to obtain DAI, **possibly at a discount** if there are not enough bids that close the auction at or above market price!

**Join us for the first auction in a live call with Gnosis CEO Martin K√∂ppelmann on the evening of Tuesday, March 5th, 2019 here:** [**https://youtu.be/Oods\_JKQlTQ**](https://youtu.be/Oods_JKQlTQ) **He will walk you through how to participate!** 

Follow the hashtag #DutchXDAI on Twitter for exact times auctions will run."

### What‚Äôs happening in the Game industry?

You have to consider you‚Äôre still lucky if the Game company tells you that they could not return your money back because of the server down. A lot of Free Game used to subliminal selling tricks the players are probably falling for, such as ‚ÄúPay for Win‚Äù and ‚ÄúPay for Time.‚Äù For ‚ÄúPay for Win‚Äù means the Player B beats the Player A, in the meanwhile, the Player B not just only wins the game, but also build up the player-confidence and use to entice the player to spend more. For ‚ÄúPay for Time‚Äù means the Game company provides the exclusive Game business package for Player A. The Player A only needs to spend time with Player B for playing the games.

In ethics, we still could find more evidence to prove that how does a traditional Game company set the trick campaigns to use to entice the player to spend more. In contrast, it is hard to run the traditional business in the Game industry. One more thing, the businessman is nothing to lose when free internet games on all the internet. The free internet games are pretty much like the free Antivirus software. It‚Äôs cutting-off the every Pays Antivirus software business. Furthermore, if we can earn the easy money from ONLINE Game business, why not give it a try? It is about the time to discover the INTERNET business actually makes any profits.

### Advantage of IOE¬†coins

IOE is disrupted the traditional way of advertising games. The players can trade their virtual items and earn a certain commission via the trading progress. Moreover, they don‚Äôt need to pay extra for Agent and can make the deal with another player directly. It helps to build a good and healthy environment in the Game industry. At the same time, the users can watch the Game developer and make sure they won‚Äôt overcharge or empty the assets from ONLINE Users.

# Is it the right time owing the IOE¬†dApp?

# ‚ú™ Blockchain Tokens:

IOE is a decentralized exchange with the security of blockchain-based for trading Ethereum (ERC-20) tokens. The IOE Coins will be sustained circulation of 100 million tokens. One inside source claims that Official Trading Platforms could not change the rules.

**‚ú™ Contract Source Code:**

The Announcement of Contract Source Code ‚Üí Click here: [Contract Source Code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x15eBe584D7a0c28a3a4e73E5430B08324F3296f9#code), and could check from [Rating Token](https://www.ratingtoken.net/?from=dappreview) OF [https://dapp.review/dapp/10328](https://dapp.review/dapp/10328) It‚Äôs pretty safe here.

**‚ú™ ETH Guaranteed:**

Neither the users can not pre-purchase IOE Coins nor other trading platforms must purchase via ETH with Smart Contracts which also holding the IOE coins as well. The user who is holding the IOE Coins with Smart Contracts can purchase the ETH directly, doesn‚Äôt need to purchase from other the trading platforms.

### Adventage of IOE¬†Coins

**‚ú™ Automating Purchase:**

The user can buy the buy/sell the IOE coins directly vis the ETH which has the smart contracts. Whoever buy/sell the IOE/ETH price will go up or down automatically. It‚Äôs similar to P3D. But the P3D could not transfer/sell to other directly and either launch to other trading platforms.

**‚ú™ Profit sharing via the transaction fee**

Purchase the ETH can get 8% profit sharing. The profit sharing will depend on how much you purchase. Sell the ETH can get 10% profit sharing as the transaction fee. The amount of the transaction fee is going to share with all the IOE coins holders and will be sharing by how much percentage of IOE token the user has.

**‚ú™ Join &amp; Share &amp; Earn Bonus!**

Invite more friends to join the Club! If one member joins the club successfully, he/she can earn the rewards by new member‚Äôs 33.33% profit sharing from the transaction fee. And the rest of 66.67% will be sharing with all the IOE coins holders.

**‚ú™ Make sure the currency stabilizes**

None of the currency can guarantee it could be more valuable or it would be crash once its launch. In contrast, the IOE can make sure the currency rate will be stabilized based on Smart Contracts.

### What‚Äôs the benefit of purchasing IOE¬†Coins?

**‚ú™ Buy Early! More Cheaper!**

According to IOE believes if the user purchases early, it would be cheaper! He/she can earn the rewards by inviting more and more new members, that could get the profit sharing from the transaction fee.

#### ‚ú™ Less than 2% of exchange¬†rate

Nowadays, the Smart Contract has already sell 100‚Äì98.421 = 1.579%, 1 IOE Coin = 0.000368ETH, when reach to 100% that 1 IOE Coin = 1.5 ETH, nearly 4000 times more. According to [Ethscan](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x15eBe584D7a0c28a3a4e73E5430B08324F3296f9)

#### ‚ú™ Going to launch on Trading¬†Platform

IOE is processing and going to launch on some international trading platforms. It would be much convenient for user trading in the nearly future.

I am thinking of investing some money into block chain and I am wondering if it's a good time to invest

" A **non-fungible token** (NFT) is an asset that represents something **unique** which  means that it is not replaceable. This makes it perfect for many use  cases and applications on the blockchain. For me, the top 3 are:

1. **Certificates**:  The fields that handle certificates often face several issues, frauds  being the most sever. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help introduce new  trustless systems and efficiently reduce friction. We can store all  kinds of certificates, from ISO documents to academic credentials as  NFTs. From there, institutions can build new systems or upgrade the  existing ones.
2. **Collectibles**: By far, this is currently  the most popular use case for NFTs, kicked off by CryptoKitties. NFTs  can represent either digital of physical collectibles. Once tokenized,  they can be used in different models. Collectibles can represent in-game  items (like a sword in a game) or players within a fantasy football  game. The options are pretty much endless.
3. **Digital art**:  Digital art is the growing field of digital media that can significantly  leverage the NFTs for their unique digital representations on the  blockchain. This way, the market can leverage a more robust control over  ownership and provenance of an artwork. New user experiences can spring  from this model and further expand this field in the public. Similarly,  in the real-world art market, an NFT can become an ownership  certificate for a specific piece of fine art.

"r/ConsenSys spoke, Bounties Network, focused much of its efforts this year to making social impact with its services. One of their highlights included the use of **Boost**, their positive action token. Teams at the event earned the token for hacking on the Impact track and mentoring other bufficorn students at the event.

&gt;The token is part of a much wider project that will continue across UNICEF Innovation events throughout 2019 and will focus on boosting efforts to make the world a better place

Bounties' partnership with Opera was also a focus during their time there, along with their Impact IRL panel that discussed empowering people in the world by enabling access to information, resources and a global pool of work and talent.

"I know scalability is a major concern with Ethereum, and that PLASMA is supposed to fix scalability issues. So, what I want to know is where are we with PLASMA, and is PLASMA still the go to scalability solution for Vitalik and company? I would appreciate an honest discussion on this topic."
"All the discussions around Afri leaving the Ethereum community got me thinking - there were 3 main responses to the situation:

1. People who saw no problem with Afri's tweets / COIs and came to his defense, many of whom know him on a personal level and could vouch for his character
2. People who had concerns with Afri's COIs (or generally how we handle COIs) and expressed them fairly and reasonably to see how we could improve as a community
3. (Mostly Anonymous) People who had spammed reddit/twitter with bullying, personal attacks, unfounded assumptions, and hostility towards Afri, and then claimed ""CENSORSHIP"" when their comments were removed

Note: I sympathize with both 1 and 2 - not taking a side here in this post!

&amp;#x200B;

I was personally shocked by the magnitude of comments that I would classify in bucket 3 above.  **Is this a potential attack vector for Ethereum?**

&amp;#x200B;

Many leaders in our community are contributing in volunteer roles (e.g. Afri was release manager, launched Goerli, etc), and for these people to see the community turn on them with personal attacks can be disheartening and cause them to leave Ethereum altogether.  **In particular, I believe we are significantly more vulnerable to this attack than centralized teams with smaller communities.**

&amp;#x200B;

One example of this is an anonymous user named ""Andrew Quentson"" who began spamming every public Ethereum chatroom over the past few days.  **It's a very cheap attack to perform, but seems to be very effective at sowing discord and is contributing to a hostile ""them vs. us"" feeling here.**  Who knows who could be the next dev to be targeted..

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?  Is this something we should be concerned about and, if so, what should we do about it?  "

"Let me preface this by stating that I am not a maximalist. May the best decentralized permission-less blockchain protocol be widely-adopted, and may that result in an economic transformation that improves the world. I don‚Äôt care who builds it.

ATM I think Ethereum shows the most promise, and it has the widest adoption. However, Polkadot has an amazing dev team with OG Ethereum experience, and it's no secret that Polkadot devs think that Polkadot might be better than Serenity.
Both projects are not complete, so it‚Äôs difficult to compare them; however, it seems that a key difference between the projects regards the heterogeneous consensus of parachains, as opposed to the homogeneous consensus of Serenity shards. To me, it seems like Polkadot has a disadvantage here, but I‚Äôd be happy to be corrected.

If consensus mechanisms on Polkadot parachains are variable, then a valid but ‚Äúcollusioned‚Äù state on one parachain (say a dPOS parachain with back-channel collusion or poor distribution) can be bridged to other parachains,and this would effectively compromise the consensus value of the other parachains.

It seems the solution would be governance around parachain inclusion, but the downside would be that it would have to be either done reactively, enacted after damage is done, or proactively, removing the permissionless aspect of the network."

"Moon's original idea evolved from a simple browser to something much bigger, a decentralized operating system, Moonad, based on Formality, Swarm/IPFS, Ethereum, etc. Sadly, we also realized building it would require increasing the team's size considerably, and we obviously can't use EF's resources for that. As such, we've decided to downgrade our internal goals, and now we'll focus exclusively on Formality and its EVM/ewasm targets, which are much more relevant and directly appliable to Ethereum.

When it comes to Moonad, though, I still think it is an amazing concept that deserves to be developed. For that reason, I'm writting the [Moonad Manifesto](https://github.com/moonad/manifesto), an informal document explain all of its ""why""s. We're now wondering if we should abandon the project entirely, or pursue external funding in order to develop all the non-Ethereum-relevant pieces necessary to build it. I'd like to hear what you all think."

My name is Patrick and I work for a tech &amp; innovation festival based in Toronto called Elevate ([elevatetechfest.com](https://elevatetechfest.com)). My role at the company is to hunt for the biggest names in tech and convince them to come speak at our festival. As a crypto enthusiast, Vitalik was the first person that came to mind when I thought of the person I'd like to hear speak most. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if anybody from this sub has any interest in having Vitalik speak in Toronto this September? I'm hoping that through this post, I can demonstrate to Vitalik that the Ethereum community would like to see him do more speaking engagements. I know he gets these types of offers all the time, but I think it's pretty rare the engagement is in his home town. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any interest, Ethereum Community? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts, u/vbuterin? "



"ETH is being centralized like never before. It's always Vitalik or the core ETH dev team who decide everything based on their own thoughts and what benefits them. How do you feel about this? ETH talked so much about being decentralized, immutable, irreversable, but it never stayed true to it's origins. 

I am very happy that ETC is out there as the main competitor for ETH and lately, I have seen a lot of discussions regarding PoW and PoS and how miners would flee to the ETC network. I think this is a real scenario happening very soon, and it seems like the ethereum team do anything to oppose the ETC network and team. I even think the 51% attack have something to do with ETH. What do you think about all this? Do you like how the ETH team is doing things back and forth in order to create distraction so they can get their plans to work behind the scenes?

**One bug in the protocol of ETH, would lead everyone to ETC.** 

Don't downvote me just because I am not writing in favour for ETH. Argue with real arguments backing up your statements, or just let it be. I don't like the tension that there is between eth fanboys and those who stay true to what a blockchain like ETC is, a decentralized, immutable and irreversable blockchain which can be used for many purposes such as dapps, iot, p2p and more things.

Hi all, I'm the developer of [Topicshare.io](https://topicshare.io/). I would like to share with you what I've been doing lately ETH wise, and would love some feedback from anyone who finds this interesting!

[Topicshare.io](https://topicshare.io/) is extremely simple blockchain platform for campaign creators and social media users.  It enables a decentralized and organic way for people to advertise or  spread messages. Imagine that you just released a new product and you  want others to spread word about it. Rather than paying for an ad, you can harness the power of social media community to spread awareness  about  your product/service/idea via their networks (only Tweeter atm). For their efforts,  you can reward them automatically, using this campaign system or if you  want to help an idea or a product, you can share it with connections in  your network, and earn Ether for it.  
If you wanna earn some Rinkeby ETH you can already test it by sharing some of the existing posts.  
If you wanna run a campaign, it will costs approx. 0.1 ETH . 

It's on Rinkeby, no email or username required, I made a lot of how to's for starters, go play with it :)

"Dear members of the crypto community,

**TL;DR: Uninstall Moon, Revoke your Coinbase API Keys NOW and PROTECT YOUR ETHEREUM**

I am the co-founder and CTO at [https://paywithmoon.com](https://paywithmoon.com/). Due to the unethical business practices Moon Technologies, Inc. has been engaged in, I have left the company.

As of today, the moon browser extension manipulates the DOM of all our users' browsers to give them an augmented shopping experience, one that allows them to shop online with cryptocurrency. Over the past couple of months, my co-founder, Kenneth Kruger, has ordered the collection of data belonging to our users as a way to improve customer experiences. None of our users have ever been asked explicitly if they would prefer to opt-out of tracking, a feature which I regularly insisted should be added. If you are a user and look under at terms and conditions stated under [https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/](https://paywithmoon.com/terms-conditions/) (dated 26 Feb 2019), you will find the agreement hidden under one of the terms and conditions.

From the moment you install our browser extension, we know exactly what pages are open on your browser, what the content of those pages are, and what you are doing with them.

The biggest and most alarming issue of all, is the process of collection of how our browser extension works in the backend - Coinbase API keys. From the moment the user initiates the connection between us and Coinbase, we watch for changes in the user's current window, waiting for the user to complete the one-time passcode (OTP) verification process as required by Coinbase. Once that is done, we programatically click the required permissions (scopes) required to create the API key as Moon sees fit.

The API key is then shown only once on the next screen, but the user does not know this (done via CSS manipulation). We extract the API keys into our backend, stored in **plain text** on our database. This is a definite security antipattern as I'm sure many of you know. **This API key is then able to be used indefinitely until manually revoked by the individual user**.

When I asked my co-founder why we should not encrypt the keys or create recursively locking IAM policies to prevent anyone in the management team to have **personal** access to our users' API keys, my co-founder constantly avoided or redirected the discussion and prevented me from building any kind of system that would protect our users.

Only two days ago, I have been locked out of my organization accounts including AWS and can no longer take preventive measures to protect my users.

**If you are a user of our browser extension today, \*\*\*PLEASE\*\*\* you need to uninstall the browser extension via** ***chrome://extensions*** **and go into** [***https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api***](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) **and revoke ALL your API keys NOW.**

If you have not used the Moon browser extension, but know of a friend that might, please inform him or her to do so immediately.

My deteriorating relationship with my co-founder has grown to a point where it simply can no longer be contained. You can read more about my experience in another post here [https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what\_to\_do\_in\_the\_event\_you\_get\_zuckerberged\_in\_a/](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/au668p/what_to_do_in_the_event_you_get_zuckerberged_in_a/).

I had created Moon as I was crazy enough to think I was able to change the world with the single vision of bringing mass adoption to cryptocurrency, accelerating the future of the financial system. However, today is truly a sad day for crypto. Until we can find a way to completely decentralize and move away from the corporations, the no-accountability attitude and greed many executives possess, we cannot hope to bring forth the dream of cryptocurrency.

Until we meet on the moon again, please be safe, not sorry,  
Alexander Ang"

"Why can‚Äôt metamask or some other wallet service providers just create a version where they aggregate all the Txs and send it all at once and confirm on mainnet in every few minute intervals (using some sort of zk-* approach or other L2 scaling solutions)? They can still keep the current version for power users. I would imagine most uses probably don‚Äôt care whether their Txs get confirmed in 15 seconds or 15 minutes, as long as it‚Äôs not taking hours or getting stuck in the queue. That way most users can pay a constant low flat fee to transaction aggregators, and aggregators, although taking the market risk on gas price, can profit from the fee difference in the long term. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something important... would be nice to hear some thoughts. "









"Hi after successful Constantinople upgrade, are we officially entering into the third phase of ethereum metropolis?"






"Hello All,

I‚Äôve been building an online library DApp. You can checkout the website I‚Äôve thrown together for it over at [http://www.booksonablockchain.com/](http://www.booksonablockchain.com/).

The idea is to make a product to access books and textbooks hosted on Blockchain.

When I was a second year physics major, short on money, I challenged myself to spend as little as possible to buy the textbooks for my classes. I found e-book copies of them, and while it was cheaper, it wasn‚Äôt always convenient. I couldn‚Äôt always pull it up when I needed to reference it in the middle of class, it was difficult to take notes on particular sections without copying down a lot of information from the book, for one particular lecture-lab I had, I wasn‚Äôt able to find the lab manual, so I had to borrow one from a friend, and the e-book sometimes proved hard to navigate through and flip quickly between sections. 

From other physics majors I learned that people like to cross-reference materials across multiple textbooks to better understand a concept, - the case that stands out is Taylor and Maclaurin series in calculus. One textbook might provide a better conceptual understanding (how Taylor and Maclaurin series are built from power series, and how they can be used to approximate any function), while another might offer a better practical walk through (how to just get the right answer), and together they give a more complete understanding to the reader. The DApp I‚Äôm working on would be capable of providing this capability by providing access to multiple textbooks on the same subject, allowing users to pick and choose between several different textbooks based on what they‚Äôre looking for.

I‚Äôve built a minimum viable interactive website to gauge the interest of my idea of providing an online library of general books, comics and textbooks that users could borrow, either to reference while they study or just as a blockchain library/bookstore.. So far, it only offers books available on the public domain, for copyright reasons. It‚Äôs also currently using the Rinkeby testnet, so you don‚Äôt need to spend any real money to test it out. I‚Äôm planning on expanding the selection in the future. 

Technology-wise, there is still a lot that needs to be improved, but during this stage, I would appreciate feedback and constructive criticism you guy have."

Brought to you by the same team that built Truffle, the popular development tool.

&amp;#x200B;

**#6**

**Speaker:** Wei Tang @Parity

**Topic:** Debugging the Consensus

**Main content:** Wei will be focusing on reflections and lessons learned for the past two Constantinople delays and how we handled consensus bugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#7**

**Speaker:** Paul Hauner &amp; Adrian Manning @ Sigma PrimeT**opic:** 

Lighthouse: Towards Ethereum 2.0

**Main content:** They would like to give a talk about some of the more technical aspects of the client / design architecture, or alternatively some aspects of the current security space in Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

**#8**

**Speaker:** Adrian Eidelman @Rootstock

**Topic:** What is RSK (Rootstock) and how it's contributing to the Ethereum community

**Main content:** Adrian will give a brief introduction to RSK and how they are collaborating in different projects in the Ethereum Ecosystem. He'd also like to present their Grants program for developers.

**Main content:** In this talk, he‚Äôll define and examine what makes a secure oracle mechanism reliable enough to be used by smart contracts for external data delivery, access to web APIs and off-chain payments. He will also review the security risks and failure scenarios to avoid when using oracles and share how developers should set up methods to maximize success. He‚Äôll look at how a decentralized oracle network can make oracle mechanisms more secure. Finally, he will present an in-depth approach that applies additional layers of security through the use of Trusted Execution Environments and cutting edge approaches such as TownCrier.

&amp;#x200B;

**#10**

**Speaker:** Wuwei Zhang @AlphaWallet

**Topic:** Token Behaviour Markup Language(TBML):  the ""HTML+Javascript"" for tokens

**Main content:** Currently, DApp can't accept a lot of tokens in one go and tokens have to gain support by convincing each DApp to explicitly support it. We need a layer for tokens to be used on various websites. Dapp developers can benefit from a uniformed, comprehensive interface for manipulating tokens, while token developers get to abstract their token behaviour code so they can interact with more DApps. This keynote will focus on tokenisation and introduce a standardisation effort known as TBML (Token Behaviour Markup Language) which will make the blockchain technical stack complete, providing utility for the economy and the internet. By virtue of TBML being a solution layer rather than base-layer technologies like Ethereum and Plasma, they choose to introduce the technology by example and provide rich business-context based discussion for a broader spectrum of audience.

"Similar to blockchain, Jim Jagielski (co-founder of Apache Software) notes that the internet in its early days was not owned by anyone, and really invited a community to equally contribute to the space. Although the community lost sight of data ownership and privacy, Jagielski believes that the future of Web 3 doesn't have to encroach on institutionalized forces. There can be a lot of movement done without big companies getting behind it.

He definitely makes a case for why blockchain and crytpo communities are insular - but its still very early in its full development. There are already open sourced devs dedicated to building the list of tools and environment - think Gitcoin and Truffle - at the moment. We'll have to see where the road will take us."

Nobody is claiming Ethereum didn't hit roadblocks in every facet during the last two years, but that doesn't discount the fact that hard working people are still trying to push this project to places that challenge the status quo and go where other projects aren't.  Consider this a call to all keyboard warriors, especially those who are angry cause the price dumped, to understand that for Ethereum to succeed (and for price to go up again), in addition to having a successful research turned into a working product, we also need evangelism.

"I just thought about this, maybe someone could point out why this is infeasible:

\-User generates a proof that his address Y has sent \[1\]ETH to address \[X\] and that this tx has \[6\] confirmations. Contract/address X is controlled by someone who wants to sell a token on a sidechain.

\-User submits proof to verifier contract on sidechain. If sucessful,  this contract issues token to address Y. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the verification of confirmations is the issue? Would the circuit become very big?"

"I'm interested in Ethereum's use for gaming and I already tried several of the most popular games using the Ethereum blockchain (CrytoKitties, MyCryptoHeroes, CryptoAssault, EtherKingdom) and in my opinion those (any many others) are not truly decentralized:

* They run in the browser, their files being served from a web server, on a certain domain name.
* I log in with MetaMask, a service which is not decentralized itself.
* The core gameplay seems to be handled by a game server.

&amp;#x200B;

*""But...""*

* Yes, some of them have mobile apps which will continue to work even when the web server is down.
* Yes, under certain circumstances ingame items are stored as tokens on the blockchain and can be traded. This makes them ""blockchain games"".

&amp;#x200B;

In case the web server or the game server goes down, the game is dead. Yes, you could still trade the tokens, but imagine their value being tokens of an unplayable game.

Hello buidlers and ETH fans alike, I hope you're as excited for ETHDenver as I am. Development is at an all-time high and it's never been more exciting to be part of this decentralized world. Keep on buidling!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing to let you folks attending ETHDenver know that the development team behind the ERC-20 token XYO will be at the event and need YOUR help, as all these projects do. One of the things they want is the following: help them build out the user interface for onboarding a diviner, one of the key elements within the XYO geolocation network. There are prizes going out to the winners! It would be helpful to follow the [Payable on Delivery Demo](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/payable-demo/) prior to figuring out an onboarding process.

&amp;#x200B;

You did read that correctly; one of the things this project makes possible, running on ETH, is a payable-on-delivery smart contract. XYO actually demonstrated an example of this at their inaugural Spatial conference back in November, using a drone delivery system that only executed an ETH smart contract once the drone interacted with one of the real world XYO devices: [https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b](https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to all the developer tools they have ready for the conference, which includes a simple dApp deployment tool (dApploy) and a smart contract creation environment (dApper). It also lists all the developer challenges they are putting out there and is a treasure trove of resources: [https://developers.xyo.network/](https://developers.xyo.network/)

Also take a look at their color coded papers to fully understand the network here: [https://xyo.network/research/](https://xyo.network/research/)

&amp;#x200B;

Make sure you don't miss the Proof of Location panel Saturday morning 10:10-10:45 on the Bufficorn stage to learn more about the grand vision. Arie Trouw (CEO of XYO), Marcus East of National Geographic, and Cameron Schorg of DISH will be speaking about all the possibilities this technology can bring to the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, and thanks for bearing with me, also check out XYO's new app COIN, which enables real world geomining. Available on iOS and Android: [https://coinapp.co/](https://coinapp.co/)

If you like what you see, keep up to date with XYO on their subreddit [r/XYONetwork](https://np.reddit.com/r/XYONetwork) , follow their updates on their Medium blog [https://medium.com/xyonetwork](https://medium.com/xyonetwork), and most importantly, HELP BUIDL!"

"Is it just me, or have had prices increased 3x-5x lately? What is the reason? "

"Hello, I have a  question to  submit  to  this  community

  
I have always looked at Ethereum with great suspicion, because it is a way to make things happen: Making a distributed database is obviously safer, but how will distributed databases be able to compete in terms of efficiency with centralized ones? It's a bit like the law of matter and light, so the more mass of matter increases, the faster you go.  How do you think ethereum solve this problem? 

Could you explain to me what scaling is? 

How has it managed to scale? 

The nodes that will act as POS will be chosen randomly (because if they were always chosen the same would be as if they were centralized?) 

Furthermore, the POS does not make ethereum centralized? Will it hold 'heavy' Dapps with the POS? 

You could explain these things to me, I don't understand them by myself

"Please do not get me wrong. I am not trying to troll or cause problems here. Honestly I just want to hear people's opinion about the ProgPow and current development.

The main question here is ""why there are some people against ProgPow implementation?"" I mean, people have been saying ""PoS is coming, any upgrade would be waste of time"" for the last 2 years. And honestly I don't feel like PoS is coming soon. So, why do we keep delaying the ProgPow upgrade? Is it because it doesn't have the miners' support? Or is it because it would take like 6-8 months to have this change, so devs don't want to waste time on it? Or any other reason?

"**Join Verity and earn some ETH by completing tasks**

Have some free time? Want to earn something on the side or join a promising blockchain project? Join a growing community of data-providers and earn ETH (Ethereum) and VTY (Verity‚Äôs utility token) by completing tasks on [**Verity‚Äôs platform**](https://alpha.verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum) and help us get truthful data.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Verity?**

In short, [**Verity**](https://verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum) is a decentralized oracle for smart contracts.

Using the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù principle, where a large group‚Äôs aggregated results often outperform any individual‚Äôs estimate, and blockchain-as-a-court-system, Verity is the solution to the oracle problem by collecting, verifying, and connecting real-world, real-time information to any smart contract.

While Verity is blockchain-agnostic, it is currently on the Ethereum blockchain and has its own ERC-20 utility token with VTY as its ticker. At the moment, Verity is still on the Ropsten test network with a working prototype and the move to the main Ethereum network is planned by the end of Q1 2019.

To further validate the project, in Januar, 2019, Verity was accepted by the Network Catalyst Accelerator run by US venture capital firm, Village Global. Village Global is backed by some of the most successful company founders including Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn).

Along with the access to advisors, experts, and other investors through the accelerator, the backing also included a hefty financial investment. You can read more about this investment [**here**](https://verity.network/blog/verity-backed-by-village-global-joins-us-based-network-catalyst-accelerator/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum).

&amp;#x200B;

**What types of tasks can I expect?**

There are numerous tasks that are available on the Verity platform varying in complexity, duration, and rewards, including:

* Sports and eSports matches (football/soccer, basketball, hockey, CS:GO, Dota2, LoL, ‚Ä¶) - tasks like who was the winner, what was the score, the play time, etc.
* Insurance claims - Whether a claim was valid or not, whether the package was delivered or not, damage of the product, etc.
* News sentiment analysis (crypto news for example) - Whether the article is bullish, bearish or neutral, etc.
* Fact checking - Fake news detection, inappropriate content, etc.
* Artificial Intelligence - Image and audio recognition, object categorization, handwriting analysis, etc.

And new event types and categories get introduced frequently to test the protocol and use-cases of the principle

&amp;#x200B;

**How do I start?**

We prepared an in-depth guide that explains everything and helps you get started, including setting up your Metamask and account creation on the Verity platform.

Read it [**here**](https://verity.network/blog/complete-guide-to-earning-on-verity-alpha/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum) and get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**How can I learn more about Verity?**

If you have any questions, we would be more than happy to help! Just send us an email at [**support@verity.network**](mailto:support@verity.network) or join our server on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/4DJhbNS), where you can talk to our moderators and other community members.

"It‚Äôs not difficult to observe the repercussions of a system under which the incentive structure dictates that it‚Äôs in the interest of Big Pharma, and subsequently the medical research that they undertake, to in fact prolong the of ailments of their *customers* in order to continue the sale of pharmaceutical products, which are thus designed to supress ongoing *symptoms* rather than ever target the root problem or search for an underlying *cure.*

This is fundamentally due to a misaligned incentive structure that *does not* target medical research toward curing disease, but rather to extend it.

I believe that it may be possible to restructure the incentives such that public funds could be paid out through a DAO to medical researchers that actually target the root causes of disease and ultimately present a cure.

At a basic level, the DAO would allow anyone from around the world to contribute to funds focused on a specific disease (eg. Cancer, Crohn‚Äôs, TB, Alzheimer‚Äôs, the common cold, etc.). Each fund would be a smart contract that could pay out according to any ‚Äòmilestone‚Äô or ‚Äòcure‚Äô determined by the members of the DAO. Contributors to a fund would become active members of the overall DAO and able to participate in its governance and the creation and management of funds.

Plausible?"

"Blockchain based games are quickly amassing players in offering unique advantages over normal game. Considering the popularity of Ethereum on applications, exactly there are some to list. I still can't believe that in just a matter of time, after Blockchain was widely introduced as our new means of integration. Even the Esports market is now turning heads as it is continuously growing at a pace that exceeds expectations. Potentially we may even see a paradigm of shift in their structure or corporate landscape as this fascinating development reach the mainstream adoption. I do think Ethereum ERC-1155 seems to be the perfect token for any blockchain-based games. There are hurdles to overcome like scalability, but to lookout for blockchain gaming as it really promising.

"A smartphone is not smart.

If it is really smart, you should be able to ask ""show me how much money I have"", it should summarise your balance over the three banks you have an account with, minus the credit card debts, tell you the final result in a number. 

If really smart, when you go to a layby counter to pick up an online order, your smartphone should give you the order ID without you rummage through your emails. It should be able to prove your identity in one go, as well, and not needing you to find your NSW Digital Driver Licence app to get your identity displayed.

Why can't smartphones do that? Why can't it integrate all the services its apps can provide?
The problem isn't specific to smartphone. In fact, the web works that way too. The only place where the web is more or less integrated is your inbox, but even that is barely integrated. For example, for an email ""a package is available for pick up"", you wouldn't know if you already picked it up since an email can't be updated.

The web is modelled after a conversation model‚Ää-‚Ääyou go to a website first, then converse with that website. Smartphones simply inherited the model. But the web didn't market itself being smart‚Ää-‚Ääit is marked as being ""connected"". So today's smartphone is just as smart as the web. It should be called ""ConnectedPhone"" really.

When the web was designed, the prevailing thinking is the ""Computer-Human interaction"" model, where a computer tries to have a conversation with a human. The web, which allows millions of computers to be networked, extended that model in a model I call ""cocktail party conversation"": you can have a conversation with any computer in the party, and if they mention something that only another computer knows, you can walk to that computer and start a new conversation.

This is how the web was built. You can access a website. Everything on that website is from, er, that website, until you decide to follow a link to a different website. Like moving to another cocktail party guest, you walk to the new website and talk.

On today's smartphones, each app is like a website. Although each of them provides mobile-friendly functions, like rotating screen and notifications, each one is on its own. They are like The Smurfs‚Ää-‚Ääeach one is a little helper, but your mobile phone is like the Smurf village. When you use a smartphone, it's more like a window to access each Smurf one at a time than a smart personal assistant. In reality, it's not smarter than the web. The web is about ""connected"", what smartphone is about? Smartness?
Google is more aware of this problem in this area. It tried to provide a ""unified front"" of services through Google Assistant. If you ask how to go to the nearest hospital, it gives not only the destination but also the means to get there: 30 minutes if you drive, 34 minutes if you use a Uber driver at $30.
Google's way of solving this problem has two serious limitations‚Ää-‚Ääit can't provide a service without having access to the user's sensitive information, and it can't be easily extended.

Tl;Dr: Web3.0 will be a seamless web of services, we are building this vision and if this takes your interest, see our paper here: https://github.com/AlphaWallet/TBML/blob/master/doc/design_paper.md"

Since Ethereum can only run on CPUs, which are not practical for running nontrivial machine learning models, what are the current solutions for running ML models on Ethereum? "

"&gt;It is with much regret the  Co-founders announce the closure of The Acorn Collective with immediate  effect. This has not been an easy decision and one that is the result of  a great deal of consideration. Whilst this decision is a recent one the  cause of it can be traced back many months.  
&gt;  
&gt;For those who have been  following us for a while you will know that our pre-sale raised  successfully. This money‚Äôs purpose was two-fold: firstly to promote the  main sale later in 2018 and to enable us to deliver an MVP. The  main-sale did not go well. We expended a great deal of time and  resources into making our main-sale a success, unfortunately the crypto  market crashed. Like many ICO‚Äôs, we also lost dollar value from the ETH  we had yet to convert to fiat. This was compounded by two  capital-raisers also failing to produce and our main backer from the  pre-sale failing to deliver their promise of another fund injection.  Investment in ICO‚Äôs had also dried up completely as we launched our main  sale, with ETH falling by over 50% in that period.  
&gt;  
&gt;The result of this was that we had to rig the operation differently to continue the project and deliver for our backers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Almost immediately, two  thirds of our team had to be laid off with the rest taking significant  pay cuts; focused solely on delivering the platform as promised. We as  co-founders injected more of our own capital to ensure we delivered the  platform. For a long while it looked as if this was possible. We are  very proud of the team, who have worked in extremely difficult  conditions to produce an MVP that has a virtual accelerator,  crowdfunding platform and marketplace.¬† Thus, we are among a very small  percentage of ICO projects which actually delivered a product.¬† However  sadly, this had not been enough to secure our survival as a project.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, the faith in  the market had not reappeared which resulted in a lot of selling of our  tokens. It is quite clear that there has been an effort to drive the  price down with market manipulation using 1-2 OAK transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lack of funding from  the main ICO sale in 2018 meant that there is no liquidity fund as  described in the Whitepaper. This fund would have been able to stabilise  the early market and to mitigate the risk to project founders when they  put their projects onto the platform. As such, there has also been no  budget for market making. Coin Market Cap have a policy of requiring  $5k/day in volume, which with no market making has not been possible,  and so there are few new buyers to the token market.  
&gt;  
&gt;These factors have combined  to represent a significant risk to any founder putting their project  onto the platform having their project wiped out. We have looked at  several ways of mitigating this risk, but recent news from our main  backer has now made even these last efforts irrelevant. The syndicate  that were largely responsible for our pre-sale success in the meantime  have broken up. This means that there is now no control over several  million tokens, and no chance of mitigating the risk to founders on the  platform without a significant liquidity fund which, as described above,  we do not have.  
&gt;  
&gt;The expectation that  projects going onto the platform (of which there are many) would raise  the token price and reduce the risk is no longer valid if a large token  holder could just sell into the gaps and crash the price ‚Äì the founder  could be wiped out and there is no way we could prevent this.  
&gt;  
&gt;With respect to the  founders we have been working with, we hope the work we have done with  you so far can at least stand you with a good chance of success as you  continue your crowdfunding journey elsewhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;To our community, token  holders, and to our team many of whom have been with us since the  beginning, we‚Äôre sorry this hasn‚Äôt been what we all hoped it would be.  We‚Äôve all tried our best to make this work and with your support came  very close to overcoming the many obstacles that have been thrown at us  since March last year. Sadly, this last one is insurmountable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for being such a great and supportive group, without your support and work, the project would have folded long before.  
&gt;  
&gt;We hope the above explains why this difficult decision is being made.

"Hey everyone, I was looking around and heard about this game -- 0xUniverse. You find planets and build spaceships to find more. Planets have resources and have different rarity levels (common, rare, epic, legendary -- just like the resources). To give you an idea, i started with only 0.02 ETH on there, bought one planet and found 3 others and have 3 rocket ships at the current time. One of the planets I got was a rare which was pretty cool to get with not much invested in the game yet. So far I'm having a really good time with it, check it out!

"I have a smart contract, I want to pass in some data from a third party - the data is not secret, but it must be proved that it is correct, it is unaltered as delivered by the third party. 

I'm thinking that the data can be passed in raw, and also a signature of the data. 

So the third party does: sig = F( msg, private\_key )

Then I can check in Solidity that it is third party's public key: public\_key = ECRecover( sig, msg )

I found this tutorial:

But I'm confused. The code where he creates the sig is:

let addr = web3.eth.accounts\[0\]

let msg = 'I really did make this message'

let signature = web3.eth.sign(addr, '0x' + toHex(msg))

Where does the private key feature in that? 

Additionally, It looks like he only verifies the hash of the data, but does not check the hash is derived from the data.

"In a recent episode of the [80000 Hours podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/glen-weyl-radically-reforming-capitalism-and-democracy/), Glen Weyl made a number of critical remarks about the ""blockchain"" as a technical data structure, claiming it was inimical to his way of thinking.

I find it strange a political economist of Weyl's caliber and influence would think he has the expertise to condemn the blockchain from a ""technical"" standpoint (not trying to dismiss his other remarks). Personally, I do believe his concerns are mostly fair and on point at the present time, but will ultimately turn out to be unfounded over the longer-term due to the selective disclosures which will be made possible by widespread adoption of efficient zero-knowledge protocols. Given Weyl's prominence in Ethereum land, it may be a good idea to provide him with some technical clarifications or counter-arguments. Anyone care to parse through his statements and offer their thoughts? 

Here's a slightly edited transcript of the relevant part of the interview:

&gt;**Robert Wiblin**: What do you think are the biggest downsides of the crypto-community? I guess I only have a vague exposure to it and it seems to me that whatever group came up Bitcoin are clearly geniuses and Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, is otherworldly I think in his insightfulness. But I guess it has also attracted a lot of over-confidence in people and people who are drawn in by the ideology more than anything else and I guess at the worst end there's all sorts of scammers and bullshit artists who see there chance to make a quick buck. Do you see them as damaging the community or overall it's still a very good group?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glen Weyl**: I would say the technology that's currently called ""blockchain"", which has a bunch of different elements to it, is a dead end. I think it has very few applications if any where that's going to be the right kind of data structure to use. I also think it has very problematic social implications. I think the ideology instantiated by the actual technical protocols right now is dark and deeply problematic. There's a spectrum from a really intelligent person who has a good understanding of what's going on through deeply naive and somewhat like self-deluding deliberately because of potential greed and so forth issues through to outright scammers. If you ask where the center of gravity is in that, it's definitely in that latter end of the spectrum. So, there are like huge problems. However, capitalism has enormous problems, as I've been trying to say, and there's very little space in our society for seriously reconsidering that and for people to think boldly about these things. I think this is offering a space for that and that's extremely important.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert Wiblin**: You're completely confounding my plan for this interview. I thought you were going to explain how blockchain was going to be very useful and I was going to explain why I was skeptical about those applications. Ok, talk to me about the technical side, why do you think the blockchain is overrated or harmful overall.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Glen Weyl**: Yeah, so first of all, the data structure instantiates a view of where data originates and how it should be stored that is pretty inimical to what's the right way of thinking about where data is and how it should be stored. In particular, I'm a big fan of decentralization, but the blockchain isn't really based on that concept. It's really based on the notion that a large part of all data should be completely public; and then a bunch of stuff should be utterly private. And that is ultimately \[...\] the anathema of the way I think about things. I actually think everything has some sphere of intimacy where it should be shared and some other sphere of intimacy (or of society) into which its leaking would be problematic. It's almost never the case that you'd want things to be stored completely globally; and on the other hand it's almost always the case that you don't want them to be overly cloistered. So, data structures that instantiate the appropriate level of decentralization and that actually store data in relationship to the community to which it pertains have to be a much closer to optimal way of thinking about data structures. And so that's at the very core of it's conceived that's a fundamental problem with the blockchain.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Robert Wiblin**: Can you cash that out in an example where the current approach would lead to things being too public and how it might be organized better?   
&gt;  
&gt;**Glen Weyl**: Well, I mean basically the blockchain says you are anonymous online and then everything you do online is like totally public and completely transparent. But like think about your reputation. Your reputation isn't something you need to share with everybody and in every context; but on the other hand it's incredibly important that you not be anonymous, because if you're anonymous you're unaccountable. So instead the appropriate thing to do, like if I were to look into your Rob and see if this is a guy I should do a podcast with, like probably what I wouldn't want to do is go to some global repository where every action that you've ever taken is either listed or completely detached from you. Instead, I would go to some people, I would get, in confidence, references about you. You see what I'm saying? Like that's that way human societies are and should work. Things should not be either global or utterly individualistic and private. They should always be shared with some communities and not with other communities. And the blockchain just doesn't have the affordances, naturally, to allow for that sort of a structure, at a technical level.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Personally, I think that due to the best interests of the leaders behind Parity Tech, it makes ""logical"" sense for Parity Tech's workforce to keep their best known solutions, in terms of creating a better Ethereum 2.0, reserved for their own platform. Further complexity is introduced into this discussion when considering that the Ethereum Foundation is giving development grants to Parity. Is it time for the Ethereum Foundation to be more active in terms of sponsoring the development of another Ethereum client manufacturer?"

"A cool feature to build on top of Veil would be a Venmo-esque betting platform.

&amp;#x200B;

At a high level, the way it might work would be that users use some sort of identity platform like Uport to login. Once logged in users could buy and sell future events with their peers using metamask + pre-made markets on Veil. 

&amp;#x200B;

A front board would show live updates and the option to comment on peer predictions, e.g.

\- Joe is long the Patriots for the Super Bowl @ $0.56

\- John is short Donald Trump for the 2020 US election @ $0.45

\- Sam is long Roma for best picture @ $0.35 and so on and so forth

&amp;#x200B;

By adding a social media angle user engagement/retention would go up, increasing the stickiness of the Augur/Veil.

If you are wise and business minded you know what you have to do. Buy the digital coins and make a fortune. Bitcoins (BTC) are the famous most among Cryptocurrencies but there is one other which is more authentic and its name is Ethereum.

## Buying Ethereum(ETH) is no more an expensive experience

The natives of Malaysia is lucky to have the [**Cryptocurrency**](https://b4uwallet.com/) ATM installed at B4U. The benefit of **Ethereum(ETH) ATM machine** is you can buy ETH here with your native currency Ringgit. We all know that it‚Äôs difficult to buy Cryptocurrencies online because if you buy the digital currencies online they charge you the heavy fee. It‚Äôs impossible to buy them online if you don‚Äôt have so much cash with you because you can‚Äôt get the few tokens online you will have to buy the bulk.

## The B4U [Ethereum ATM machine](https://b4uwallet.com/) has so many benefits. Let us list few

1. If you don‚Äôt want to buy the bulk of digital coins it‚Äôs OK you can buy few from this machine.
2. ATM won‚Äôt charge you much when you will buy token from here.
3. ATM won‚Äôt invade your privacy much. You will just have to scan the QR Code of your digital wallet and that‚Äôs it.
4. Not just the Buying, Selling and Exchange of Cryptocurrencies is also possible here.
5. The process of buying the **Cryptocurrency** form ATM is not lengthy but convenient.

## Sell your Cryptocurrencies conveniently

It‚Äôs not easy to sell your Cryptocurrencies online because a lot of technicalities are involved in it plus the tax is too high but with **Ethereum (ETH) ATM machine** all is easy. If you have few tokens in your wallet which you think you don‚Äôt need anymore or if you simply want to sell it to get some money in your local currency which is Ringgit. This ATM is your answer. We take your coins or tokens and we give you what you want. Your money in your local currency. When you will sell your ETH with us you won‚Äôt have to pay much tax and we won‚Äôt invade your privacy at extreme levels.

"Hi there,

tl;dr: Is there already an application or platform where private end users can easily conclude a smart contract? 

Me and a friend of mine came to this question because of the following concern:

He owes me money for a flight booking. I don't need it at the moment and he would like to buy more ether, but at the same time he doesn't want to be in debt.
So the idea is that he would buy some eth which are locked in a smart contract. At a certain date or at a certain time the initial invest  will be paid-off to me in eth or directly in fiat. Maybe with a share of the profits since we are bullish on the long term ;)

Is there already an easy to use app or platform for end users to realize that? I could imagine that Elix has a function like this but we would like to have an eth solution."

The site currently shows your ETH balance, ERC20 balances, **MakerDao** CDP information, **Uniswap** liquidity pool contributions / values, and **Compound Finance** borrowing &amp; lending. It attempts to calculate an overall net worth based on your net asset value in each Dapp + your ETH / ERC20 token balances.

Right now it‚Äôs a fairly rough POC, but it works and wanted to get it out there to collect feedback and see if others are interested.

**Backstory:**

I have a number of different addresses I use in my hot wallets, and kept losing track of which Dapps I was participating in. I wanted one place to go to 1) remind myself of old App activity and balances, 2) track my overall wallet net worth more easily, 3) check for updates without going to a computer with a web3 browser and signing in and/or pulling out the cold storage.

**Benefits:**

* No web3 browser needed, and no private key (so you don‚Äôt have to break out the cold storage every time you want to check balances)
* Works on mobile web browser so you can check from anywhere / any device (iOS safari has issues with web3 for some reason, but Chrome and others work)
* Integrations with top DeFi apps - Uniswap, Compound, MakerDao (more can be easily added based on feedback)
* There is no back-end database. Nothing is saved, other than your address in local browser storage, so that you don‚Äôt have to enter it in each time (based on feedback I can make this configurable as well)

So far it‚Äôs just a small side project that solved a problem I had. If there‚Äôs any broad interest, happy to add other features and improve the UI / UX.

Note: Right now it's only using data from the follow Uniswap exchanges: DAI, MKR, SPANK, ZRX, BAT"

"Hi everyone,

I transferred 11ETH into mist ethereum wallet but getting ""Wrong Password"" error when trying to send out some ETH.  I don't remember setting up password for this account, however I spent all day and night trying every conceivable password I may have used, but keep getting ""Wrong Password"" error.

There are many people who have experienced this issue because there are lots of posts and topics on github regarding this.  Some end up remembering the correct passwords, others, like me, swear they use correct password but still getting ""Wrong Password"" error.  I am not crazy.  I have university degree and study computing science in another in 3rd year.  I also work as software developer.  So such mistake for me is very unusual.  

Is it anywhere within the realm of possibility that it's a bug or that the password I may have set up wasn't encrypted properly by the wallet program?

Thank you,

Victor."

"Hello Reddit, We recently put together an analysis piece on how 51% attacks can impact the crypto market.

here is a small excerpt from the article which we believe is allowing threats of these attacks to become more commonplace.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to remain decentralized, cryptocurrencies using a proof of work system must not allow a single party to control the majority of total hashing power.
&gt; 
&gt; But as the global pool of hashing power grows more liquid, cryptocurrencies need to pass another important test. They must be able to resist an attack from the total rentable global hashing power for their specific algorithm. Otherwise, arbitrageurs may find it financially attractive to rent hashing power in order to perform 51% attacks.

" Hello buidlers and ETH fans alike, I hope you're as excited for ETHDenver as I am. Development is at an all-time high and it's never been more exciting to be part of this decentralized world. Keep on buidling!

![img](s23ib0chgsg21)

I'm writing to let you folks attending ETHDenver know that the development team behind the ERC-20 token XYO will be at the event and need YOUR help, as all these projects do. One of the things they want is the following: help them build out the user interface for onboarding a diviner, one of the key elements within the XYO geolocation network. There are prizes going out to the winners! It would be helpful to follow the [Payable on Delivery Demo](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/payable-demo/) prior to figuring out an onboarding process.

&amp;#x200B;

You did read that correctly; one of the things this project makes possible, running on ETH, is a payable-on-delivery smart contract. XYO actually demonstrated an example of this at their inaugural Spatial conference back in November, using a drone delivery system that only executed an ETH smart contract once the drone interacted with one of the real world XYO devices: [https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b](https://medium.com/xyonetwork/xyo-game-changer-weve-executed-a-smart-contract-with-a-drone-4deb414af67b)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the link to all the developer tools they have ready for the conference, which includes a simple dApp deployment tool (dApploy) and a smart contract creation environment (dApper). It also lists all the developer challenges they are putting out there and is a treasure trove of resources: [https://developers.xyo.network/](https://developers.xyo.network/)

Also take a look at their color coded papers to fully understand the network here: [https://xyo.network/research/](https://xyo.network/research/)

&amp;#x200B;

Make sure you don't miss the Proof of Location panel Saturday morning 10:10-10:45 on the Bufficorn stage to learn more about the grand vision. Arie Trouw (CEO of XYO), Marcus East of National Geographic, and Cameron Schorg of DISH will be speaking about all the possibilities this technology can bring to the real world.

And lastly, and thanks for bearing with me, also check out XYO's new app COIN, which enables real world geomining. Available on iOS and Android: [https://coinapp.co/](https://coinapp.co/)

"Context : Neutrino acquisition by Coinbase, and the balance between data privacy vs. legitimate community information sharing 

Has there been any thought towards building a decentralized blacklist or reporting function? 

Currently, fiat bank accounts which engage in malicious / scam behaviour are tracked in centralized databases at government / financial institution association levels. I wouldn't be surprised if Interpol has a database like that but highly doubt it is used extensively.

Is there a decentralized blacklist that has been built? If not, what would something like this look like?

- Attestation - submit claim or accusation about a particular address
- Validation - confirmation or contestation of claim?

I see a bit of this functionality already existing in the comments section of different block explorers. 

Caveat: I do see that most scammers will just generate a new address for each target, but this would still be useful for local fiat exchange KYC or community investigation &amp; research efforts. "

The idea is there are multiple voice channels, for people that want to focus on different areas and with different levels of expertise.

The main areas are Technology, FinTech, Game Theory, &amp; Memetics/Politics.

"Hi, everything basically in the title. I've bought ETH recently, and I dont understand it much yet, do I have to do anything with the upcoming forks ? I hold my ETH on mew via trezor"

"There has been recent confusion over #ProgPoW and whether or not it is going to be implemented in a future Ethereum hard fork. Here is my understanding of the situation as it stands. I consider myself a liaison to the Ethereum core developers and facilitate the Ethereum Core Dev meetings that happen every other Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when we were deciding the issuance reduction at the end of 2018, ProgPoW was brought up a lot. Some considered it a ""bargaining chip"" for miners to accept the issuance reduction. Some miners believe that it was agreed upon that we would put ProgPoW in a hard fork in exchange for an issuance reduction. In reality it was decided at the time that we would investigate ProgPoW to the fullest extent that we could but made no promises of implementation. Here is the relevant clip from our discussions at the time: https://youtu.be/mAs3JZHroKM?t=2386

&amp;#x200B;

In Core Devs Meeting #52 (January 4, 2019) it was decided we would go ahead with ProgPoW. It was decided by me asking the group if anyone had any opposition to moving forward with ProgPoW and no one speaking up. It's sort of like accepting a proposal by silence. To be clear, there were some core devs who were in favor of ProgPoW and had been for a long time so there was no need to reiterate their support at that moment. We were only looking for dissenting opinions and otherwise we would go forward with it. The exact quote from me is: 

&gt;So not to get too much in the weeds. It sounds like what we've come to is that we are going to tentatively go ahead with ProgPoW and by tentatively what we mean is we're going ahead with it unless there's a major problem found within the testing or things of that nature. Is anyone feeling like that's not the case or if there's different feelings? Okay great. Then we will be going forward with ProgPoW.

From 1:24:59 in the video - https://youtu.be/iSc3TbjZu1k?t=5099

Meeting #52 Notes: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2052.md

&amp;#x200B;

In a later meeting (#54), it was decided that

1. The community (via the Ethereum Cat Herders) is forming a 3rd party audit.

2. Miners should start vote signaling using extraData field.

3. The Ethereum Cat Herders are going to investigate other ways to help parse community sentiment and help find a way to make a decision.

See tweet: https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/1091358335960535040

There is also a video and notes for that meeting (#54) located here: https://github.com/ethereum/pm

&amp;#x200B;

Since then the Ethereum Cat Herders have been working hard on finding the appropriate auditor and raising funds for the audit. Audits of this kind are expensive. The Cat Herders will be releasing a full blog post early next week with more details, including

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, a decision was made to move forward with ProgPoW, but no timeline was given as to when it would be activated in a hard fork. It may be activated in its own fork or with Istanbul. If an issue is found by the ProgPoW audit, we may not go forward with implementing and activating ProgPoW. The process to come to a consensus on ProgPoW has been messy and not ideal. I personally believe that we are currently operating primarily under a technocracy due to the fact that there is not a governance infrastructure in place for the community to voice their decisions without the signals for such decisions being gamed. It is unfortunate, and I think **we can all work together to make our decision-making processes better as we grow as a community.**"

"Hello. This probably gets asked frequently, but here goes anyway.

Could someone ELI5 to me what one needs to do to stake ethereum in the future? I'm aware of the 32ETH number that's being tossed around but otherwise I'm pretty clueless.

Would one have to run a node or can the 32ETH just be in a wallet? Also, how much is the initial cost/internet bandwith/electricity for running a node? Assumingly not nearly as much as mining

I've seen an internet video of making a btc node with a raspberry pi awhile ago but don't remember much from it. Thanks "

"One thing that has frustrated about the ProgPoW discussion is just the pure apathy we're seeing from some leaders and devs on the topic. If it goes through, it may be because not enough cared enough to stop it. If it fails, it's because the few voices that do oppose overpowered the majority who mostly don't seem to care at all. Ask a dev about most other EIPs and most will take a stand one way or another (because many of them impact their dApps). Ask a dev about EIP-1057 and frequently you'll get a ""meh, I'll go along with the consensus.""

Look--I get it. We've finally gotten to a place where the DeFi ecosystem and other projects have matured and become pretty damn usable, and we've all seen a ton of potential finally come together into real projects in some really great ways over the past few months. As long as that functionality is working and secure and with room to grow, many of us simply don't care much about the underlying PoW algorithm that drives us until PoS.

ProgPoW pro or con aside, this saddens me. I think it's a shame that so few people care about the distribution mechanism that we'll be pretty dependent on for probably another 2 years minimum. Beacon chain will take at least a year or 2 to mature, ballpark minimum another 5-8% of total supply or so will probably come from 1.0 before we can genuinely start to move off of it, and nobody gives a shit about how that happens, who that supply goes to and why?

Part of me is pro ProgPoW simply because it seems to be our last hope at at least fucking *trying* to improve our distribution mechanism that we're still going to be dependent on for a couple of years. If it fails to pass, I'm pretty sure it will be our last attempt ever, barring any emergency.

And I acknowledge that realistically, there probably won't be an emergency if it fails. ASIC miners will most likely behave and not stir the pot causing us to question their dominance. I still don't think that we should necessarily be OK with them dominating field though. Those with access to cheap production (primarily those in China) and insiders close to ASIC manufacturers will always have a leg up, and I'm surprised so many are okay with this type of industry being the main beneficiaries in core economic distribution.

I realize GPU mining is always going to be flawed as well, but at least we can fucking attempt to be generalized with it. I'd rather give *at least a small shot* for a user with a couple of 1070s and cheap energy who actually cares about Ethereum to mine blocks than let it become a exclusive to specialized fucking milking factories. It‚Äôs not that GPU farms aren't bad in their own way, *it‚Äôs the order of magnitude difference ASICs can allow the manufacture to have over time.*

And maybe I'm wrong! Maybe the the risk is just too high, and it's right thing is to just stick the path for the benefit of not shaking the boat and go with what's working. We've seen Monero have successful ASIC resisting forks a couple of times without any significant security events occurring, but that doesn't mean ours will work without incident. But even if I'm wrong at least I fucking care about it, unlike some of you who won't even take a stand.

I'm sorry for sounding harsh, and likewise sorry for continuing to stir the pot on this issue which I'm sure many of you are tired of hearing about. I just find it genuinely sad that there is that much apathy for something that I personally believe is still pretty important. Some of the apathy is bear market driven I know, but I also get the sense that dApp devs are complacent in functionality to the point that they don't give a shit about the vision anymore. 

Or worse, they *say* they care about the vision while simultaneously ignoring the problems with the underlying tech they build on. ""Look--my dApp has potential to open up financial opportunities to communities around the world! Oh, the underlying protocol it's built on has fundamentally flawed distribution and will for at least another 2 years? Never mind that, we don't care about that anymore."" 

It just feels like we've lost something.

"Last year at Devcon4 in Prague, Aya Miyaguchi (Executive Director for the Ethereum Foundation) shared the values and organizational philosophy of the Ethereum Foundation. She told us the Foundation had embraced a Japanese business management practice known as ""*kaizen*"" (""improvement""). This refers to an industrial-style production regime or process that seeks to continuously improve an organization's tools, techniques, and labor force by cutting down all work-related functions to their bare essence. It's basically a form of Zen Buddhism as applied to lean manufacturing. This involves an aesthetics of spiritual purity which aims to create a kind of formal beauty out of a state of emptiness. Aya explained her understanding of this organizational philosophy in the following way:

&gt;""In today's society we're programmed to value addition; and society has trained us to believe more is better, the bigger is better. But this addition has a dark side. More people comes at the cost of more resources. More money comes at the cost of more human exploitation. And more power comes at the cost of more human inequality. When we add thoughtlessly we create embarrassments in the world. This is why we have to increasingly think about this philosophy of subtraction \[...\] This philosophy isn't really new to me. In Japan we have this expression, 'beauty in subtraction' and it's deeply rooted in Zen Buddhism. It's similar to minimalism, but not quite the same. Subtraction allows ideas, tastes, and strengths to exist in their purest form.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""At the Ethereum Foundation we actually aim to grow small. That doesn't mean we're not hiring. But hiring should only be for what the Foundation can do and we try to minimize our power wherever we can (as much as possible) because what we want to grow is the entire ecosystem, not just the Ethereum Foundation. So, as the community grows and the industry grows, we'd like to be a tiny part of it.

I should begin by saying I have the utmost respect for Japanese culture. I'm acquainted with the Kyoto School and have learned a great deal from various Buddhist traditions. I don't wish to dismiss the wisdom of the East. I commend Aya for guiding the Foundation in this direction and wish no insult upon her. She strikes me as a wonderful strategic mind and a very effective coordinator. With that said, I have the distinct impression she has misinterpreted the spirit of this doctrine. I'd like to look at the ""dark side"" of her interpretation (as I interpret it) and offer a more balanced point of view. 

My primary concern is that beauty in subtraction (improperly implied) will in fact lead to ""corruption in subjection"". The Foundation shouldn't be ceding more and more of its publicly-endorsed authority without first finding suitable publicly-endorsed replacements, which is close to impossible given the immature and chaotic state of the ecosystem. It's critical to bare in mind that the public trust was vested in the Foundation itself. By cutting down their strategic leadership to its bare essence the Foundation has in reality created a power vacuum, which causes other interests to rush in to seize the reigns. Generally speaking, the majority of these interests are unlikely to be committed to the public interest. They won't be sharing the Foundation's benevolent ideas or values or philosophy. By permitting this void in the power structure to exist, the Foundation has invited a reckless struggle for control between the technical elite. This kind of competition will lead to a scenario where the strongest players subject everyone else to their preferred regime. The end result is that the line of succession will be broken and all legitimate power therewith will evaporate in the eyes of the global community. 

One can just as easily behave thoughtlessly through subtraction as through addition. In aiming for ""purity"" we also clear the path for impurity. All things are inverted by their opposites and *kaizen* is not exempt from this philosophical fact. With more people comes the ability to generate more resources. With more money comes the ability to relieve more suffering. With more power comes the ability to rectify more inequality. A strong vision and sense of leadership is what safeguards the integrity of the ecosystem and keeps it in a healthy state (as we all move forward to a far more publicly-viable kind of decentralization, i.e. with reasonable checks and balances to prevent abuses). This is why we should recognize both ends of the spectrum. Each side has a critical role to play. Only through the measured balancing of both do we achieve things in their highest form. The Foundation shouldn't aim to be ""small"" in the near-term (in the long-term perhaps, but now is not that time). Instead, the Foundation should expand and contract organically to reach our collective purposes. I would strongly advise them to assert their power, which is actually a prism for our collective power, to whatever extent is most reasonable and necessary to support the public good above all (you make a profound error in creating a ""devocracy""). 

It's an existential risk of very great consequence to undermine the community and the ecosystem itself by undermining the very basis which grounds them both. My concerns are shared by many others in this community and they shouldn't be dismissed just because a few people in strategic decision-making positions have embraced a spirit of techno-magical escapism, ethico-political denialism, and cynical compromise. I don't believe these ""stars"" fully grasp the implications of their ideology. They're leading a great many of us astray and I fear no one will be left with the power to stop them."

"We coin the term ‚Äúsecurity economics‚Äù¬†to mean the system of economic incentives designed to guarantee the security required for a public chain to operate. For example, with PoW (proof of work), honest miners are incentivized to contribute compute power for mining reward. The higher aggregate hash rate of a network, the more difficult it will be to perform a 51% attack. We will introduce a new framework¬†to analyze this relationship, and study the limiting cases where the current security economic relationship might breakdown. 

In a given period T, the blockchain network will release n coins according to its predetermined mining schedule. For example, bitcoin currently reward 12.5 coins per block. Its mining difficulty is adaptively set so it produces 144 blocks per day, with a very small margin of error. Whether total network hashpower is 50 ExH/s or 5 ExH/s, total reward per day is always 1800 bitcoins. Only difference is that the expected reward per hash diminishes when total network hash increases. But hashpower cost money, 50 ExH/s will cost 10 times as much as 5 ExH/s, assuming they‚Äôre running on the same kind of hardware. The economic equilibrium¬†is arrived when **reward per day (RPD) = cost per day (CPD)**. 

We further breakdown CPD to its components: sunk cost (e.g. cost of the miner) and **operating cost per day (OCPD)**. We make the following postulates about the mining process and miner‚Äôs behavior. 

1, When price of a coin goes up, temporarily RPD &gt; CPD, new hash power will be introduced as it will be profitable. 

2, When price of a coin goes down, but RPD &gt; OCPD, then nothing will happen. 

3, When price of a coin goes down so much, that RPD &lt; OCPD, some miners will stop mining, total network hash will fall, until RPD &gt; OCPD again. ¬†

4, Mining hardware have a useful life of approximately 2 years, miners would only deploy new hardware if they can cover cost within 1 year of mining. 

Assuming the above behavior of miners, in the equilibrium state, the total hash power (per second) of a network is bounded above by the market value of expected reward (per second). To stage a 51% attack on the network, the adversary will need to match all of the existing hashpower on the network. The required investment is approximately equal to the market value of minable coins in 1 year. Take bitcoin for example, a total of 52560 BTC are released to miners a year, which equate to about $189m, assuming $3600 / BTC. The total hashpower of the bitcoin network is about 42 ExH/s, which equates to about 3 million Antminer S9‚Äôs. This is what it takes to stage a 51% attack, the cost of staging such an attack is a good measure of how safe a network is. 

Would anyone do it? Perhaps not, which is the ingenuity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Assume you did invest $189m, and compromised the bitcoin network. What returns will you get? Sure, you double spend bitcoins, but bitcoins will be worthless when people find out its security is being compromised. The delicate game theoretic equilibrium, which we shall call the Nakamoto equilibrium, is just as important as all the cryptographic wizardry in keeping a blockchain safe. 

The Nakamoto equilibrium design has a number of drawbacks, although none of them were of interest for Nakamoto to consider, they do not apply to bitcoin. 

1, Nakamoto equilibrium only guarantees the security of the public chain itself, and not the smart contract tokens which runs on it. 

2, Out of all the blockchains that use the same hash algorithm, only the one with the most honest hashpower is safe. 

We will focus the remainder of this paper elaborating point number 1, and leave 2 to another article. 

The utility tokens created in the ICO hype, were predominately ERC 20 contracts executed on the ethereum network. Despite of their huge speculative value, these tokens do not have much intrinsic value right now. They simply represent the access right to a particular utility, which will be built (if ever) far into the future. The aggregate market value of all ERC 20 tokens, have never exceeded that of ethereum. Hence, the hashpower required to guarantee the safety of ethereum is automatically extended to the ERC 20 tokens running on the network. 

We now consider a scenario with securities tokens produced from STO‚Äôs. A security token represent a share of a securitized asset. These could be company stocks, bonds, buildings, infrastructure etc, indeed everything in the world could be securitized and tokenized on a blockchain. The fundamental difference between securities token and utility token is that securities token have an intrinsic value attached to it. The intrinsic value of a securitized asset could be several times the market cap of the public chain it‚Äôs running on. 

For example, as of Feb 2019, ethereum have a market share of about $8 - $10 billion dollars. About 7 million ETH is minable a year (before the Constantinople fork), the total value at current market price of $120/ETH is about $840 million. The total network hashpower is 140 TH/s. A Bitmain E3 miner has an advertised performance of 180 MH/s, so total network hashpower is equivalent to about 777777 E3 miners, which would cost roughly $800 million (though the exact cost could be quite volatile). This is how much one would have to invest to stage a 51% attack on ethereum network. If the network consists of only ETH and utility tokens, whose value would plummet if such an attack were to be successful, nobody is incentivized to do so. But (imagine sometime in the future), if the ethereum network has securities token contracts, whose underlying asset worth a total of a trillion dollars, then carrying out such an attack would seem quite profitable. ¬†

A new security economic model is clearly required for any public chain to run securities token. The biggest problem with ethereum, is that miners are not incentivized to contribute hashpower, as a function of total market cap of tokens running on ethereum. This is not a problem in the era of utility tokens, when they are worth significantly less than the main ethereum network. In the era of securities tokens however, this will become a significant risk, as securities tokens can easily worth several folds more than the public chain itself. We need to figure out a new economic model, where the public chain‚Äôs hashpower is a direct function of total token value running on the public chain. "

"The DutchX 2.0 smart contracts have been deployed in preparation for dxDAO governance. Once the dxDAO launches, it will control the DutchX trading protocol‚Äôs ‚Äòauctioneer‚Äô powers‚Äîthe ability to alter the contracts‚Äô parameters or logic.

"I know this is an ethereum subreddit but I think this is on topic as a decentralized browser discussion. It doesnt use any blockchain but more of a BitTorrent like way of sharing files.

Has anyone else messed around with this? Compared to like status browser etc... They are alot different. 

Anyways just wondering if anyone thinks this could be a ""competitor"" or if ethereum wallets such as meta mask could be integrated into this. I think it could be very cool. However I am also somewhat of a cynic and I dont think people actually want a decentralized web but just want crypto integrated into our pre existing infrastructure for many reasons, one of the main ones would be there own monetary gain.

Tldr: beaker browser... Any thoughts?"






"There appears to be a [leaked document](https://coinspice.io/news/leaked-ethereum-foundation-documents-show-growing-rift-before-pending-fork/) in the works (signed by 97 devs) which could ignite our very first class struggle: a veritable ""devs versus plebs"" scenario, as /u/DCinvestor phrased it.

Basically, the enlightened hardworking devs are pulling together in defense of Afri against the big bad social media troll army with their crazy false narratives. Let me give you a flavor of the language in this document. ""\[They\], the contributors and workers behind the projects"" intend ""to grow awareness by educating the community"" and cleanse us of ""the kind of toxicity that \[they\] as a community should avoid"". Apparently, a trifling number of complaints were valid and respectful, while the vast majority of plebs have been ""asserting \[Afri's\] involvement in wild conspiracies, issuing personal threats"", and have gone ""far beyond acceptable standards of debate"". Apparently, a nebulous sense of ""humanity and better systems"" takes precedence over free speech. Apparently, the plebs are so crazy and destructive that it's the devs ""responsibility to protect each other"". They ask how they can ""move past this \[incident\], as humans""; and whether or not we ""realize how much this intimidates"" them. Apparently... we're just a cruel mob who ""mass downvote them on Reddit"". Apparently... they ""reject this mob mentality"". Apparently, poor old Afri was ""just speaking his mind"". He didn't deserve to be drowned ""under a sea of hatred"", they say. Because, of course, our meaningless ""internet trolling"" is ""rooted in frustration or a sense of powerlessness"". 

Well then, the ""voices behind Ethereum"" have spoken. Our ""campaign of hate"" must not prevail. They ""will not accept, nor look away"", but ""will stand up against it"". Because at the end of the day it's all about preserving ""the mental and emotional health"" of fragile humans, isn't it? 

I don't know if I'm being polemical or if I'm just rephrasing things into more objective language, but this seems to be quite literally what this document is saying. I doubt it's fake because it really does sound like the kind of response we've been hearing back from Hudson, Maria, and their friends on Twitter. 

I don't speak for anyone but myself when I say this, but I'm very disappointed that these individuals are here to ""manifest the mission and vision of Ethereum"". Their general grasp of the events over the past few days is comically disconnected from the actual facts and concerns raised by many thoughtful voices in this vast and largely non-dev-oriented community. They're trivializing the discussion. I'm pained to say it but these devs look tone deaf and cowardly. Even worse, they look like a sectarian mob in their own right; one with a dangerous superiority complex.

To re-iterate a comment I made earlier: There are insidious in-group/out-group biases forming in Ethereum. The ""Ethereum community"" isn't just about the devs and their everyday relationships. It dwarfs that; and extends far and wide into a complex social movement encompassing an extremely diverse crowd of people. It's quite disrespectful and irresponsible to reduce ""us"" to a mere mob or whatever on the internet. You can't just pretend that everyone outside your filter bubble is somehow hostile or irrelevant. At the end of the day we're all here to support Ethereum in one way or another. It would be wise not to draw too many sharp lines between us.

I'd like to open this up to discussion and hear everyone's thoughts, thank you."
There's been a lot of controversy lately over who should be a moderator. It should be simple: people who's #1 priority is Ethereum. If people have moved on to other projects that's ok. It's a big world. The people who moderate a community though should be those who make it their #1 priority.

"Ethereum community, brothers and sisters, devs and investors, builders and trolls, users and newbies, can we move on?

This is getting old!

Community: ""Can we talk economics?""

Devs: ""Hell no, go pump your bag elsewhere!""

Community: ""Can we talk transparence and ethics?""

Devs"" ""The hell with that!, we don't owe you anything!""

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, devs will dev, investors will invest, builders will build, but to make a real functioning family, we need to come to terms with opening our minds to other people's interests and skills. Yes, Economics, Transparency and Ethics are extremely important for the growth of this platform. Devs are not qualified to handle these and ignoring them will have consequences. These are not sub-topics, they are an integral part to the success of Ethereum and what it aims to achieve.

Either deal with it now, or bear the consequences, because, trust me, they will come!!"









"Big parts of the augur community are currently pulling off this scam:

\-Create market with very subtle mistake in the description (like non native english language) 

\-Scammers bet on the outcomes that will not win

\-Scammers stake REP on the market being invalid

\-All staked funds will be distributed equally. So scammers that bet on the wrong outcome will profit.

This makes Augur unusable at this point since basically every single character in the market description can be used to render it invalid. The staking model doesn't work because the majority of REP holders doesn't participate. 

Pretty sad :("

I can‚Äôt really seem to find a conclusive answer on this if there‚Äôs a direct relation between greater adoption of ethereum blockchain projects to the demand for ethereum? 

"[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/avuqn8/i\_am\_andrew\_yang\_us\_2020\_democratic\_presidential/ehhy88k](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/avuqn8/i_am_andrew_yang_us_2020_democratic_presidential/ehhy88k)

&gt;**1.** Given that experts have recommended [paper ballots](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=25120) as the most secure form of voting, and arguments that [electronic voting is always a bad idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI), **what evidence has lead you to support online voting as a secure election method?**  
&gt;  
&gt;AY - Right now it would not be a secure method. I agree that paper ballots are currently the most secure, and even during the transition you would want to have paper ballots as a backup. I believe in the vision of online voting but would not rely upon it 100% until the tech is ready for primetime.  
&gt;  
&gt;**2.** Blockchain technology seems to be key to your voting proposal, and I've seen my fair share of justified skepticism surrounding this concept to cast doubts around its effectiveness in solving this problem. **How could a blockchain be implemented in a way that could solve any concerns with electronic election fraud or interference?**  
&gt;  
&gt;AY - The potential of blockchain is vast. Theoretically a public ledger could allow for us to be 100% secure that our votes are cast without fraud or interference. The tech is not there yet for nation-scale elections but it could be in time. That is the goal.  
&gt;  
&gt;**3.** Convenience of online voting seems to be a driving factor in your support of these changes, but voting from anywhere with no physical trail seems to open massive opportunity for foreign interference in our elections, which is a concern for many after 2016. **How exactly would your mobile device voting be verified to only come from US citizens?**  
&gt;  
&gt;AY - There would be a registration process analogous to what is currently done where one can verify one‚Äôs citizenship and address. We have public records of most voters and verifying citizenship would be straightforward. With the proper safeguards in place, it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to have a foreign power interfere without our knowing about it ‚Äì if the tech is ready. Again, it‚Äôs something we need to move toward to achieve a more powerful, flexible and genuine democracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.** *Bonus question also about voting:* Do you support alternatives to first-past-the-post voting (such as ranked-choice voting, instant-runoff, or single transferable vote, among others), which would fix many issues in our democracy (like being stuck in a 2-party system, a natural result of FPTP voting)? **How would you work to get superior alternative voting systems implemented around the nation?**  
&gt;  
&gt;AY - I am for ranked-choice voting ‚Äì our current first-past-the-post system tends to help incumbents and discourage voters from ‚Äòwasting their vote‚Äô even if a certain candidate is their true preference. Some have suggested that Trump would not have won the Republican nomination last time with a ranked-choice system as other candidates could have built more support as the 2nd and 3rd choice of many others. The process matters. I would champion ranked-choice voting as President. It would improve our democracy.

Awesome to see some insights around future potential"
"There has been a lot of talk lately about how our community interacts with other projects in the space.  Some have reduced people's legitimate concerns to simple narratives like ""the Ethereum community has become maximalist and intolerant.""

I reject this notion and I feel that this is an unfair maligning of a broad and diverse community.

What some may miss that there are many here who are in favor of multiple types of chains and approaches, but *just because they may not be in favor of the same chains that you are doesn't make them intolerant ""maximalists.""*  I own quite a bit of Bitcoin, for example.  I also own tokens from other projects.  But I am not in favor of chains like EOS for many reasons- does that make me an Ethereum maximalist?

Ethereum is more than a technology- it's an economic and social revolution.  For many of us who believe in the value proposition of Ethereum, the origins and goals of other projects (both stated and unstated), are of paramount importance when evaluating them.  I realize that for others, Ethereum is more of a technology revolution.  I believe it is both.

And for some of us, we find certain approaches in the open source blockchain space to be particularly objectionable (e.g., combining lucrative token sales raising funds beyond what is needed for development, benefiting a narrow group of stakeholders like VC's and hedge funds, and combining those things with on-chain governance for an L1).  For the record, those are the very reasons I rejected EOS.  And perhaps even more importantly, we also pay close attention to how your project leaders and team members interact with those in the Ethereum community.  Is it productive and does it engage teh whole community?  Is it demeaning?  Is it manipulative?  EOS burned many bridges when they launched themselves as an ""Ethereum killer.""  Other projects are now making similarly foolish mistakes, possibly in more insidious ways.

**I have a message for those projects, from one small piece of that community:**

*It is not incumbent upon the Ethereum community to just accept such alternative approaches (be they technical, fundraising, governance, engagement, communication, etc.) and be labeled as ""maximalists"" when we reject them, or reject tacit endorsement of them by others-* it is incumbent upon those projects / communities to properly articulate their value, as well as any additional value they may create for Ethereum.  *That's* how you gain the support of the Ethereum community- not forcing it down our throats and calling us intolerant when we question it.

I have long said that if I find a project which can decentralize the world better than Ethereum, I will sell all of my ETH and support said project.  I look for that project regularly, and so far, despite all of the marketing narratives from competing (or complementary) projects, I still haven't found it."

Gods Unchained is a TCG game based on the Ethereum blockchain, which draws some of the best from games such as Hearthstone, MTG and Fearia. Experience and turn them into truly community-centric games. At the heart of Gods Unchained is an advanced blockchain-based game that gives users the freedom to trade and sell their cards and own the ownership of cards, just as they are in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the game background

&amp;#x200B;

1. Temple

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""The Great Temple... is both the arena of the gods and their playground.""

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/kfeyghjs69j21.jpg

Every 1000 years, the gods wake up and play great games. Mortal people flock to cater to their favorite gods. Choosing a God and guaranteeing your loyalty, winning the game will bring eternal glory, if failure will be despised at the same time, but in the end, it means you will be forgotten.

&amp;#x200B;

2, the god of light

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""In the temple, we must trust. It provides order and law for all of us.""

*Processing img jjjlsg1u69j21...*

Samuel is a kind and kind God, and his heart softens because of the goddess of life, Marissus. They lived in harmony in nine mortal fields until Ludia - Â´âÂ¶í their public worship and power - developed a plan. She disguised herself as Marissus, calming the real goddess and fighting fiercely with Salar. What is distracting is that Sidid turns his sword to himself - this is the only weapon that can hurt him. When the real Marissus woke up, the dying God, she found that her power did not help; he had surpassed the veil, and life had no authority. Turning to the only way she left, Malissus looked for him in death: violating the sanctity she brought back from the underworld. When life returns to God, he finds himself staring at the cold eyes of the goddess of death. Now, his old love is completely contrary to what he represents, and they are committed to restoring purity and justice to these areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Use spells to restore justice to the battlefield: a card that determines what the player can or cannot do. Call on loyal followers and followers to execute a quick hand of justice. Force your opponent to fight in accordance with the terms of justice.

3, goddess of death

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""For my followers, death is just the beginning...""

*Processing img 9b9vqs6y69j21...*

Once a goddess of life, she was Samuel's lover until Ludia separated them and forced her into the void. There, her heart burned with resentment, and the long, unowned night of the underworld ended. The spirit of forgetting lives in her kingdom and promises their immortal worship. The new ruler blessed these subjects to the deadly kingdom, where they caused serious damage to her dissidents. The cost of this magic made her appearance imitate, turning her into something completely inhuman and demonic - a mirror of the internal torture landscape.

&amp;#x200B;

Death does not always end. For those who master it, forgetting is only the second deck. Take creatures from the void and send them back to the board, eager for revenge. Use the power of resurrection to build an undead servant army, eager to please your violent goals. But fans should pay attention: everything comes at a price.

4, the god of war

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""...Your crown will add a beautiful power to my collection.""

*Processing img xet8wml079j21...*

Some people say that if you listen carefully, you can hear his name echoing in the ruins of the castle ruled by his enemies. He endlessly bloodthirsty through the realm of nine mortals: killing those who oppose him and turning any survivor into an assistant of fear. He reminded him of the terrible power with the crown of the king and queen who had stood by him.

&amp;#x200B;

Oros was eclipsed by death and chaos. Those who assure him should expect to play quickly and loosely with their creatures - some lives are more valuable in death than on the battlefield. Enjoy powerful weapons and spells, instigating all direct, bloody battles on the board. Join his conquest, or his collection... The choice is yours.

A free-spirited witch who rules everything that grows up. Iona was a resident of the temple, but soon after her brother and the only confidant Elyrian disappeared into the sky, Iona retired to the wilderness. Inspired by the song of desire, the animals came to her side along the river bank and dedicated their dedication. There, she built a home in the forest to understand the original and unaffected beauty of life. But even for its goddess, such beauty will not be thornless. These nights are a bitter and sweet reminder of the lost Irian. Her brother is there, in the huge star network. Now the servant with wings sings his return. Iona wakes up the forest and embarks on a journey to the temple. This is not only the pursuit of victory, but also the pursuit of answers.

&amp;#x200B;

Witness the power of eternal untamed...Build a flock of beasts on your deck, a habitat that has never been touched. Sing a spell against the wind and release a devastating elemental spell on your opponent.

6, the magic god

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""Traveler, my potion is too strong for you.""

*Processing img a4kfwk2c79j21...*

Elyrian found that he was always nosy, and this habit made his peers uneasy, stingy and unsatisfied. Instead, he began collecting 12 ancient masterpieces‚Äîthe remains of a forgotten Titan race. For thousands of years, he has been exploring, hoarding these works in covert research and pouring their wisdom. Iona became anxious and worried that this trouble would ruin her brother. Despite this, he continued his work to decipher the riddles and hymns of primitive creatures. The text whispers a ruined temple, shrouded in a misty fog, and the Titans unveiled the chain for the first time there. At night, he sneaked out and sailed deep into the universe. He reluctantly returned to the castle, hoping that the castle would provide more keys to his research.

&amp;#x200B;

Your mastery of matter is the key to casting magic, manipulating your deck for perfect drawing, and blowing up your opponent with explosive spells. The possibilities are as rich as the universe. The disciples of Illyria did not know the boundaries of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9xuclzle79j21...*

Ludia is a master of chaos and tricks. She smiles with warmth and innocence, her hands crossed behind her back, adding a lot to the castle. Nothing is more interesting than the empire's ups and downs in your name, and the castle's precious tournament is just another chance of mischief. Join her evil followers and find happiness in the chaos of your own Machiavelli design.

&amp;#x200B;

Skilled Ludia players will enjoy powerful tools that will allow them to disrupt the enemy at any time. Steal cards from their decks and set up destructive traps as long as they keep 2 steps forward. Those who follow Lucia's footsteps know that life is a game, and rules are as easy to change as players.

Third, the gameplay

&amp;#x200B;

1, the basic gameplay

&amp;#x200B;

For those who have never participated in a trading card game, and want to learn the basic mechanism and gameplay of this type.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Basic knowledge

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4639h7ah79j21...*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Gods Unchained is a turn-based competitive trading card game. Every game is a 1v1 battle, and the opponent is another player (or computer). The goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's life to zero. Players use their collections to make decks of cards and choose a god to play at the beginning of each game. There are exactly 30 cards on the deck.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a free game, unlocked with a core set of non-tradable cards, and access to weekly free rotations. You won't lose any cards when you play this game.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Card type

&amp;#x200B;

In the game, each player moves in turn, first gaining magic (a kind of renewable resource) and drawing cards, then using magic to play those cards.

&amp;#x200B;

The card can be a creature, a spell, a weapon or a special god card. Players can also gain the power of God, which can be used once a time, except for the ultimatum, which can only be used once per game.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Card use

&amp;#x200B;

In the upper left corner of each card is its mana cost. If the card is a creature, it will have yellow and green gems in the lower corner. The number on the yellow jewel is its attack, showing the damage it hits. The number on the green gem is the health of the creature, which shows how much damage it can take before it is destroyed and enters this space. Most creatures also have text, and they also define special rules related to the card.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Spells and weapons

&amp;#x200B;

Cards without yellow or green gems are spells or weapons. When a spell is played, its effect takes effect immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

When you play cards, your god will equip the weapon. They allow your God attack attacks to deal damage until the weapon's durability is zero and it is destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

2, advanced gameplay

&amp;#x200B;

Learn the complex things that make God different, and get some insight into the key decisions of game designers and balancers. Start preparing for early access to the beta version.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ The power of God

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the Gods Unchained game, each player can choose the power of God. Each God has three routines and one ultimate power to choose from. Ultimate power is a single-use ability with powerful effects.

&amp;#x200B;

These abilities help the player to be more flexible when building the deck. They also reduce the frustration of building decks, specifically designed to counter the annoying decks of the meta (and never really match it). Choosing power can increase the strategic depth of each deck.

&amp;#x200B;

E.g. When playing a combination-focused magic card, you can choose to use a defensive strategy and divine power if you match the armor. Or, if you want to play against a dead opponent, you can turn to a more aggressive game style.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to your god's excellency, there is also the potential to build a deck of games. You can make a very slow and controlled armor, not their typical aggressive style. Your opponent may choose the wrong power for the game and give you an advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Void

In Gods Unchained, when a creature dies, it moves to the void. This includes labeled creatures and creatures that you discard. The only exception is the creature that was ""destroyed"".

&amp;#x200B;

The soul of the destroyed creature will be destroyed and removed from the game. This is an important consideration when faced with some decks, using the advantage of creatures in the void. Cards like Half-Life and Gatekeeper allow creatures to come back from the void, giving insightful players the ability to stop their opponent's plans.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Keywords

&amp;#x200B;

The effects of keywords are very specific and designed to promote attraction and strategy games.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Big escape mode

&amp;#x200B;

The Battle Royale mode in Gods Unchained is our limited format, and the Royal Card game begins with many players choosing 15 cards for their deck, from their deck, free spins, and randomly selected decks. The winner of the game can grab a few cards from the opponent's deck to cope with the next game.

&amp;#x200B;

As you enter the 16th and 8th rounds, more twists are waiting for you. You need to add extra skills, so think carefully about your choices. This situation continues until there is only one player left. The awards are based on your achievements, and even the top 8 can make a difference. Each account has free access to Royale every day.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Trading on Ethereum

&amp;#x200B;

Each pack contains five Gods Unchained Genesis cards, each with a unique Ethereum ERC721 token and an encrypted collection card. This means that you have full ownership of every card you have, just as it is actually printed.

&amp;#x200B;

After the balance test, all cards will be permanently locked and can be traded unrestricted between players in any market.Genesis cards will only be created during the pre-sale period and will not be available in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Rareness

&amp;#x200B;

Rarity is a rough measure of card scarcity and is inevitably recorded on the blockchain. Rarer cards are not necessarily more powerful, but given their novelty, they offer a unique game strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, we can prove the accuracy and quantity of each card's circulation. Myth cards are the rarest, with only one card per card. We limit the creation of myths to four times a year. Two mysterious Titans are hidden in the pre-sale card package, and one will be auctioned shortly after the release.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ limited edition

&amp;#x200B;

The Genesis set has 380 cards. Genesis cards can only be cast by opening the package during the pre-sale period. After the pre-sale, the public market is the only destination for your creation of cards - they will never be cast again.

&amp;#x200B;

Genesis cards can be used in ranking games, big escape modes and world championships.

&amp;#x200B;

The cool thing is that they can be used in any game built on the Gods Unchained token.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Presale

&amp;#x200B;

If you purchased a card pack during the pre-sale period, you will also be allowed to enter our beta version in advance. This will give you some extra time to prepare for the World Championships and give us important feedback to the better God.

&amp;#x200B;

We listen very closely to our community. We are working with game design experts, game economists and legendary streaming media to make the game as balanced, competitive and fun as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Tournament tickets

&amp;#x200B;

Gods Unchained will host our first World Championships in the first quarter of 2019. We donate 10% of the card package sales to the bonus. To participate in the competition you need a Champions Ticket, which is a fully tradable ERC20 token.

&amp;#x200B;

The legendary and shining legendary card pack comes with tournament tickets and is finally available. Alternatively, you can purchase 0.2ETH or other players directly from us. A cap of 20k tickets will be created.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¢ Shiny card

&amp;#x200B;

Each single card can also be a shadow card (5%), a gold card (1%) or a diamond card (0.2%). These effects are only superficial, but significantly affect scarcity.

&amp;#x200B;

You can create a lower layer card with a combination of shadow, gold, and diamond cards. Five standard cards can be combined into one shadow card, five shadows become a gold coin, and five gold coins become a diamond.

&amp;#x200B;

Five, the game FAQ

&amp;#x200B;

Some answers to common questions about the game, so that players can master the game better and faster.

&amp;#x200B;

1. General questions

&amp;#x200B;

What value does the blockchain bring to the game?

&amp;#x200B;

A lot! Traditionally, the items in the game are directly owned by the company that created the game. When you buy items in the game, such as your character's favorite skin, you don't own it - the game company licenses you. By using blockchain technology, we can change this so that players actually have the items they buy or earn in the game. They can sell items for real money if they no longer want it, they can use it from the game to use other games, and the best game developers can't destroy the value or power under the item DLC forces players to buy. But that's not all; through the blockchain, we can prove the history of individual assets! Imagine that in the final round of the World Championships, an incredible game came from an unanticipated card. Now imagine that the player auctions the card to a charity by digital signature. Because its trading history is in the blockchain, any future owner can perform digital proofs anywhere, including in the final round of the tournament, as it was created.

&amp;#x200B;

Will there be a free version?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes! There will be a set of non-tradable cards that all players can use.

&amp;#x200B;

When can I play this game?

&amp;#x200B;

Our beta will be released in Q3 and the full game will be released Q4.

&amp;#x200B;

What devices can Gods Unchained use?

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, we only used it on laptops or desktops. We plan to integrate with mobile devices, tablets and VR in the future when technology is available.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a browser-based game?

&amp;#x200B;

Although our creative sales are entirely in the browser, the game itself will be released as a desktop application.

&amp;#x200B;

2, about the card

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get a card?

&amp;#x200B;

There are three main ways

&amp;#x200B;

Free set: Everyone can play a game with a basic set of cards that cannot be used.

Card Pack: You can purchase a card pack to unlock a limited edition card.

Trading: When the game starts, you will be able to buy and sell cards with other players in the secondary market.

&amp;#x200B;

What is a balance test?

&amp;#x200B;

Card games are hard to balance. Even the most talented team in the world, with decades of experience, will make mistakes from time to time. In a centralized game, this means that the card becomes boring. In physics games, this means that cards will be banned from use in the game. While playing cards and forbidding playing cards are not good for anyone, it is sometimes important to stay entertained and energized. So when something inevitably passes our testing process, we plan to capture it as our balance beta. The balanced beta will be a new listing after a month. During this time, cards can be collected from the package, but transactions cannot be made. This will give us enough time to understand how the best platforms are running, make any changes, and then tap the switch that allows them to be swapped. This way we can have a balanced game instead of punishing players who trade with expensive cards early on.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is the card not initially tradeable?

&amp;#x200B;

Cards that have recently been introduced to the game, such as cards in the card package, will be locked into the transaction during the balance test (we will explain this in a later FAQ). This lock-up period helps us ensure that each card is well balanced before trading in the secondary market, making it easy for players to understand that the cards they buy alone can no longer be leveled or weakened by us, and their scarcity is fixed. . The lock-in cycle also ensures that we will never compete directly with the secondary market, achieving a healthy separation by minimizing the relationship between trusting players and us.

&amp;#x200B;

3. About the game

&amp;#x200B;

What is the Gods Unchained World Championship?

&amp;#x200B;

Every year we hold a World Championship for Gods Unchained. In our first game, we will sell for $100,000 plus 10% of the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

How to enter?

&amp;#x200B;

We will print up to 20,000 championship tickets (one ERC20 token) for admission. Buy any legendary or shiny legendary package and you will receive a free ticket. You can also buy a ticket from other players or buy it through us. Tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis, and registration begins immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

When will the World Championships be held?

&amp;#x200B;

We have not yet determined the exact date, but we are planning the first quarter of 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have other games?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, a lot. We are studying something interesting. In the near future, we will make a statement on this.

&amp;#x200B;

4, about game trading

&amp;#x200B;

What is Genesis sales?

&amp;#x200B;

Now we are holding a Genesis sale, players can buy the first card before the game is released. These cards will only be produced during the sales period and will not end until the end of the game release, or until we reach the $15 million sales limit.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I need to participate in Genesis sales?

&amp;#x200B;

\- A laptop or desktop computer with Chrome or Firefox installed.

\- MetaMask, a browser extension that acts as a digital wallet that allows you to interact with our games.

\- Ether, a form of digital payment that powers the gods.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I buy a card pack after the pre-sale?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, but they will be different cards. Each season we release about 100 new cards that can be found in the bag. Once the season is over, we remove the card for that season from the package, which means that the only way you can get a special card from the past is to buy it from another player.

"Web3 does not currently return the bloom filter for each transaction when getting a block.

Is there a reason for this?

We can use the bloom filter in a dapp to determine if a block contains transactions that might be of interest to a user, but it's not possible to figure out exactly which transaction without checking each one individually. 

Including the transaction bloom filter in the transaction objects returned from web3.eth.getBlock would allow this.

Filters are currently very unreliable for detecting contract events when using public Ethereum infrastructure.

Thanks.

" *Collectibles are a common use for non-fungible tokens.*

One early pioneer of non-fungible tokens was¬†CryptoKitties, a blockchain-driven platform where players have the chance to collect and breed digital cats.

If you‚Äôve ever owned a cat, you‚Äôll know that they are not easy to replace, as their appearance and personality make them unique. In this case, CryptoKitties replicated this concept in the crypto world ‚Äì with each cat‚Äôs digital genetic material being stored on the blockchain. They can be bought and sold using Ethereum, and some are rarer than others. Indeed,¬†as reported by Cointelegraph, sales hit $12 million last year ‚Äì with the most expensive CryptoKitty reportedly going for $120,000.

Other games have promptly followed, such as fantasy titles where fighters are collected for battles. And in another apt development (almost like we planned it,) Major League Baseball in the US is planning to launch a game where baseball cards can be exchanged on blockchain.

"Open question: Where are we in determining viable USD Stablecoins?

I was writing a blog post explaining the basics of ""stable"" cryptocurrency for our startup's blog and realized I haven't even dove into the latest on these, so I can only speak at the surface right now. My partner sent me [this article](https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484) a while back which questioned DAI's ability to actually scale. I ask because our application, [Zabo](https://zabo.com), is aiming to pay/stream income as a digital banking app and we'll onboard one of these to the platform down the road.

Probably the **biggest mid-year conference** (over 250 speakers ? 1500 attendees ? wtf?) is coming up in literally **two weeks** in Paris, and I don't see anyone talking about it [*(again?)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/82n6eg/115_speakers_at_ethcc_and_no_one_is_talking_about/]).

&amp;nbsp;

It's free for students [(apply here)](https://goo.gl/forms/Bx4AHC1XiU5vBYxF2), free for volunteers [(apply here)](https://goo.gl/forms/YvIlO18YdVSASiTP2).  
Tickets are [240euros](https://ethcc.io), sold at cost (they even published [last years' budget](https://medium.com/@jdetychey/ethcc-balancing-the-budget-of-a-community-conference-ae68198c2eeb)).  
Pretty low fare compared to other events...

&amp;nbsp;

Right before the conference there's the [**Ethereum Magician Council**](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/council-of-paris-2019-announcement/2438) (it was actually founded during last EthCC if I recall correctly). Right after EthCC there's the first [**ETHParis**](https://ethparis.com) hackathon.

Free transactions. That's the main reason. Money needs to be frictionless to be useable. 



"*This essay is an excerpt from* [*#cryptospring*](https://pages.consensys.net/cryptospring_is_here)*, a series of behind-the-scenes stories about the state of the Ethereum ecosystem from dapp founders, security engineers, data scientists, and more.*

Every time the Ethereum protocol improves, more people enter the ecosystem. The design goals for Ethereum 2.0 are as meaningful for the protocol as for the community. Decentralization, resilience, security, simplicity, longevity. As PegaSys‚Äô applied researcher Ben Edgington recently [wrote](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwtv0) about Ethereum 2.0, ‚Äúno participants will be required to have big-iron in order to be full participants of the system.‚Äù Ben was talking about hardware, but this vision is for the people behind the machines, too.

Anyone can participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. It doesn‚Äôt matter what country or college or company or codebase you come from. You can build dapps. You can build deep down in the stack. Who are the core developers? Whoever wants to commit to Ethereum. Look at the contributors on GitHub and find out. If you can commit, you can build.

Building on the Ethereum blockchain is only getting easier and more secure. Anyone who‚Äôs ready can get a world-class DevOps experience through a suite like [Truffle](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwtX0). [MetaMask](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwv40) and [Infura](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwhW0) make it easy to manage accounts and connect to Ethereum without syncing a full node. Light clients are emerging. Every day, more plugins and APIs are available. The [EthStats](http://net.ethstats.io/) API helps you monitor the health of your node or network. [MythX](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwjH0)‚Äôs security analysis API helps you verify your smart contract code. These tools make us faster, safer, more confident builders.

The Ethereum ecosystem is also striving toward simplicity, which‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas developers and designers know‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis difficult to achieve. Gavin Wood and Andreas Antonopoulos‚Äôs [*Mastering Ethereum*](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) is a public good for the entire ecosystem. It explains Ethereum in the simplest terms possible, while also doing justice to the wonder and complexity of the system. [ConsenSys Academy](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwjX0) is not only bridging the Ethereum knowledge gap but using Ethereum to secure and streamline accreditation. The [Kauri knowledge network](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwpT0) is simplifying content hosting, distribution, and discovery for anyone creating or looking for technical documentation about Ethereum. In terms of UX, Austin Griffith‚Äôs [burner wallets](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwBL0) have made onboarding and transacting astoundingly simple for new users.

### Ground Reports from the Ethereum Ecosystem

During all this talk of crypto winter, I believe we have already turned the corner into spring. Everyone wants to know what the signs are. Making blockchain predictions isn‚Äôt all too different from making weather predictions. The best practice is to forecast according to surface reports upwind. This is what I know is happening on the ground in the Ethereum ecosystem:

* **The dxDAO is a next-generation decentralized autonomous organization for community governance of software protocol.** Gnosis is ceding full control of the DutchX trading protocol to the community via the [dxDAO](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwBS0). Martin KoÃàppelmann of Gnosis [predicts](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwq40) that the dxDAO, which is 100% community-owned, has the potential to become one of the largest organizations on the planet. As outlandish as that sounds, it is never a good idea to bet against Martin.
* **Digital publishers now have an open source option to archive their content in decentralized environments and deploy token-based business models.** [Civil](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwqc0) will soon be natively integrated into Newspack, WordPress‚Äôs new publishing platform. This is how quality online journalistic content becomes censorship-resistant and financially sustainable.
* **Crowdfunding is evolving.** Gitcoin‚Äôs recent experiments in [CLR donation matching](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwqj0) are helping projects with many contributors get an exponentially larger match.
* **The backbone of Ethereum 2.0 will soon be operating on testnet.**Various teams that are building 2.0 Beacon chains are planning to sync on a testnet in coming months. Ethereum 2.0 is a thoughtful and elegant system that will usher in scalability at layer one, the base trust layer of Ethereum, even as many technologies come online to enable scalability in transactional throughput at layer two. 2019 will be a breakthrough year for Ethereum scalability. It has already begun.

Crypto winter was a phenomenon experienced mostly by those who pay attention to token prices rather than the exponential surge of development we saw in 2018 that continues unabated. I am fortunate enough to spend my days with people who are close to the machine and they continue to enjoy the balmy weather. For most buidlers, Ethereum public chain and application layer development has barely skipped a beat. And while some in the public blockchain ecosystem were fretting about token prices, [enterprise blockchain development](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/) has done nothing but accelerate. At [ConsenSys](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwgt0), we expect to do at least five times more work on the enterprise side in 2019 as in 2018.

### 4 Tips for¬†BUIDLers

If I could tell buidlers a few things, I would say:

* **Commit to infrastructure.** Because blockchain technology rapidly unlocked liquidity, it is not likely to obey [the usual hype cycles](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwCn0): they will be compressed and there will be a series of them as we have already seen since 2009. Commitment to infrastructure will help the ecosystem weather turbulence ahead and reach the real blockchain golden age.
* **Explore future business models.** Groups like EthMagicians Business Models Ring are thinking hard about token use cases and the market economies of Web 3.0. I agree with Kevin Owocki that [utility tokens are just the tip of the iceberg](https://medium.com/gitcoin/the-web-3-0-universe-is-expanding-4792ace15cb6).
* **Prize decentralization.** As Ethereum 2.0 shapes up and Plasma goes to mainnet, we will witness the emergence of a network of stateful networks. The real measure of a blockchain is not just transactions per second but decentralized transactions per second and the cumulative decentralization of the network.
* **Have fun.** Ethereum was built by developers for developers. And we are still somewhat in the [hobbyist](https://hubs.ly/H0gCwCH0) era for blockchain. Build what you want. Experiment. Think way outside the box. Don‚Äôt do radio plays on television. Figure out what this new medium is really going to be all about. Build blockchain games. Play blockchain games. Games will be a great way for us to learn how blockchain-based mechanism design and cryptoeconomics enable new approaches to system-building. These new approaches will usher in an era of pervasive gamification within the systems of our societal infrastructure going forward.

When exactly will all the technologies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe core protocol, the layer 2 solutions, the token models, the UX, the public chain, the permissioned chains‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcombine and connect to hurl us beyond the blockchain turning point? They already have. Entrepreneurs and technologists are pouring into the ecosystem to build out the decentralized world wide web, Web 3.0. Once you‚Äôve seen the profound implications of blockchain, you can‚Äôt unsee it. Each new wave of the hype cycle will bring larger and larger cohorts of builders and users. For these people, there is no turning back.

"Okay with Proof of Stake nearing, do we have details on how similar it will be with other proof of stake coins that started out as PoW and then went full PoS like Blackcoin and Vericoin?

Will offline staking be possible or encouraged at all like what was accomplished with Novacoin?

Do we know if it will be a PoW/PoS hybrid at first and for how long before a full transition?

It's really exciting to have a green solution around the corner."

**Cryptocoin Wallet that pays profits if you stock coins. Earn profits each hour.**  
*Why use another wallet if we pay you to use MyCoins?*  
Use  6 Cryptocoins in our wallet (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Futurocoin,  Dash and QTUM) and you will receive profits each hour in your  CryptoWallet. Use our wallet to receive and send your favorites coins.  

 **Enjoy a trade bonus of 1.30% from your  total Trades. We will pay back 1.30% from your total Trade Balance on  01/08/2019. So dont lose time and start trade now. - &gt;** [**https://mycoins.global/?friend/89251757563909**](https://mycoins.global/?friend/89251757563909)

**How it Works?**  
It's very  simple. Just use our wallet to receive/send BTC,DOGE,LTC,FTO,DASH or  QTUM. When you receive the coins and hold them in your balance, you will  receive the profit from your total balance every hour. If you spend  your coins and if your balance reaches below 0.000001, you will not  receive any more profits until you have more than 0.000001 in your  wallet again. The balance of profits will be managed on a separate  balance and you can withdraw when you reach the minimum allowed for  withdraw (each coin have the mininum and you can check on your Office).

Vitalik had a video a while ago (can't find the link) that showed efficiency vs. feesability for blockchains. At the lease efficient end you had people who needed things like privacy, sensorship resistance and immutability (basically criminals) Where on the more efficient end, the platform would become feesabel for people who just benefit from these things.

"This proof-of-storage is based on a simple asymmetric signature function \`signature(segment)\`, and a symmetric key one-way function (not a hash function, rather one that produces a ciphertext with the same file size as the preimage. )

  
The proof-of-storage is based on that every server stores a unique encrypted version of the file, without access to symmetric key. The file is encrypted with a symmetric key one-way function.   


The client can choose exactly how many copies of the file they want to store, by paying for exactly \_n\_ number of encrypted versions of the file (only client has access to symmetric keys. )  


Periodically, for example each month, the client publishes private keys that servers use to generate ‚Äúproof-of-storage‚Äù, signatures of the file they host. The signature (proof-of-storage) uploaded to the smart contract decrypts the segment of the encrypted file that was used to generate signature (new segment each month incentivizes server to store whole encrypted file), and validates the proof-of-storage if \`proofOfStorage == signature(segment)\`. The signature is also used to select the next segment.  


A commit-reveal scheme is used to prevent stealing of proof-of-storage signatures.  


\# Economic incentives  


The client deposits a payment to the smart contract. The server also deposits a sum equal to the payment. The server also commits \`signature(segment)\`, with a private key they choose. This prevents the client from claiming the reward (only they and the server have knowledge to claim reward. ) Removes uncertainty. The server uploads that private key together with their proof-of-storage, and both are validated. If verified, payment is automatic."

"*Full disclosure - Verity is a blockchain oracle.*  


There's been a lot of talk about blockchain oracles recently - being able to increase the adoption of smart contracts and make them more applicable for real-world scenarios. There's already quite a lot of talk about various companies and how they are building oracle solutions - for example Chainlink, Witnet, Rhombus - as well as projects that require an oracle - eg for prediction markets like Augur and Gnosis.  


We ([Verity](https://verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=ethereum_sub)) are also working on an oracle product - although have taken a different approach - using the wisdom of crowds - focusing on the hard-to-get or unstructured data, rather than data that is already available.  If you're interested in seeing how it works or helping us test it to earn some rewards - you can join a test event here: [https://alpha.verity.network](https://alpha.verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=ethereum_sub).  


We think it's a really fascinating area, and with a number of companies focusing on it - hopefully we'll begin to see a range of solutions that will start to enable wider-spread use of smart contracts.   


Any feedback or suggestions much appreciated.  


PS: below as a screenshot of a test event.

"As far as I know, Ethereum does not have a decreasing supply inflation mechanism like Bitcoin (whose supply inflation decreases by half every 4 years). There were talks about a thirdening in ETH though (not sure what the consensus on that is).

I'm interested in knowing why such an inflation model was chosen for ETH?"

"I'm not really a casual when it comes to crypto, so I can only assume how the average person would feel about this.

I initiated a transaction with 5 WEI txfee (average confirmation speed)

After submitting it, the average increased and the Estimated Confirmation Duration is almost 20 hours.

So I thought, ok I just initiate a new payment with more for the fee (40 sec estimated conf).

That tx is in limbo because the other one is still stuck (lower nonce).

So I thought I cancel the first which then should push the second one through.

Nope! Nothing happens at all now. Ethereum cut me off of all my funds for an estimated 19+ hours. Now imagine your bank tells you: sorry man, you got all this money in your bankaccount, but that $5 transfer you initiated 6 hours ago is still not through - can't help you mate.

I know this will get downvoted because it's not positive but seriously think about it how a normie would feel in this situation. I'm frustrated because I couldn't sell the pump, I would be pissed if I had to pay something really important like groceries, taxi or the bill after going out. Gotta have some FIAT as back up always because you may have a tx stuck."

"Since we made our beta available to the public, we've received an eye-opening feedback from the community. We want to thank the whole community for that. It's your feedback that keeps us moving toward our goal which is making ETH the common medium of exchange in everyday shopping. As a payment processor, there are some differences between our users. The first type is Ethereum veterans who have been in the community for very long. The 2nd type is the new adopters who use our system as their second point of interaction with Ethereum after an exchange.

   
 1- The veterans have expressed to us that they dislike a custodial wallet and they want to pay online using the wallets they already use.

   
 2- Our growing new adopters love the fact that they can put some ETH in their wallet and shop online without using any browser plugins and enjoy buyer protection.

   
 At this split road we want to do the right thing. Unlike many of the actors in crypto ecosystem, we don't want to cater our system only to the needs of the new adopter of ETH even if they are our growing userbase. We want our system to be useful for the old veterans in Ethereum community as well.

So, we‚Äôre working on making our system work for anyone who want to pay when they shop online using their own wallet. We‚Äôre doing that by making our payment plugin supports payments coming from any wallet instead of only supporting payment made through our custodial wallet. This allows everyone to be able to pay for their purchases using their own wallet, while our early users can still pay using our own wallet.

There is whole host of tweets from Mr. Jameson attacking the community. One I find particularly damaging is a GIF of a man coming back from a 10 day internet break (assumingly Mr. Schoedon) and the house is on fire and everyone is beating up on everyone else (assumingly the Ethereum community). Mr. Jameson is now using his twitter as an attack vector against the grass-roots Ethereum community. I'd say if anything, considering the situation at this stage, Mr. Jameson's tweets may be worse and more inflammatory than Mr. Schoedon's tweets. 

I don't think  Mr. Jameson has handled this very well. He is letting emotion getting the best of him and blaming the community for a situation that he had ample time to solve himself a long time ago. "

More often than not reddit vocally supports the exact opposite of what is a good idea. So here is my proposal to the Eth devs: 


**Quit supporting reddit as a means of communication and serious discussion. The vocal crowd does not represent anyone I know in the industry, nor has it been proven to have the best interest of Ethereum in mind.**

I will do my part by continuing to ignore reddit in forming intelligent and researched positions. If I somehow fail to do this by visiting some shit thread saying Vlad is betraying the world and he should be exiled because ""blah blah my money"" I promise to sell some of my Eth and buy a ""competing"" project. 

Additionally I will work to ensure every company I work for currently and in the future will invest time and effort in whichever projects listen least to anonymous crowd thought idiots."

As far as my research goes, I found to ways to ""Interact"" with an Ethereum Blockchain from an android app we have:

* [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mobile-Clients:-Libraries-and-Inproc-Ethereum-Nodes) :  Which seems quite complete implementation of a light client but people report that it can take many minutes to sync with the blockchain.
* [kethereum](https://github.com/walleth/kethereum) : Which is a library ""Currently it is not a full featured Ethereum implementation"". But contains enough code to allow the /r/walleth app to work.
* [Status](https://status.im/) : Which seems to offer to run web3js based DApps but the experience seems far from straighforward as a native app.

So status seems not really an option for Native Dapps, Going with Geth would make the app slow to start which will be of course unacceptable for end users, would going with kethereum be enough secure and enough to interact with custom smart contracts ?

# What's u/cryptochecker?

It's a bot designed to provide information and transparency to the communities across Reddit that are interested in cryptocurrencies. It offers 2 services:

1. Providing short summaries of the cryptocurrency subreddits in which a user has been most active, in order to help other users estimate where their biases may lie.

2. Providing information and links to CoinMarketCap for any token requested.

# What's in a user summary?

This bot provides a quick overview of the crypto subreddits that a user posts in the most often, as well as their total and average karma for those posts. It will also show the average sentiment of those posts (more explanation of ""sentiment"" [here](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html)). It also links to a longer more detailed summary in its own subreddit, r/cryptochecker. This is to avoid taking up too much space in comments sections with the full results.

# What coin info can the bot get?

This bot provides a table of key data on cryptocurrencies when their symbols are supplied. This table can be sorted by any column, like any other Reddit table.

# Usage:

**To request a user check:** reply to any comment or post they the user has made with `u/cryptochecker` and nothing else. Alternatively, in the body of a comment replying to the user's comment or post, include `u/cryptochecker check`.

**To request coin info:** put `u/cryptochecker info` somewhere in your comment, followed by some coin names, e.g. `u/cryptochecker info BTC eth BCH` will give information on BTC, ETH and BCH.

I feel like the technology might actually be catching up to the hype too. With the tech now allowing near instantaneous payments at nearly 0 cost. Improvements are being made daily to accessibility too, the new Samsung phone supports crypto out of the box now!

**Brief:**  The topic falls under ""Security"". Smart contract users and security auditors can benefit from a mechanism to recover the original structure of Ethereum contracts, as evident from

past work: most security analyses of smart contracts begin with a decompilation step. Here, he presents contract library, a portal containing a high-level decompiled representation of all Ethereum smart contracts. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a high-level representation, ameanable to analysis. Its internal intermediate representation of smart contracts  makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit.

**Speaker:** Steffen Kux @slock.it

**Topic:** Incubed Client - The Smallest Minimal Verification Client

**Brief:**  Connecting small IoT devices to the blockchain is a real challenge because they are usually not nearly able to run a full node or even a light client. The connection via a remote client is neither secure nor really decentralized. With the Incubed Client, a stateless minimal verification client is available, which can verify all information from the blockchain on its own and enables decentralized access - and this with such a minimal resource requirement that this client can easily run on a small microcontroller. The presentation shows how the client works and short examples show the integration in Javascript/Typescript and C.

**Speaker:** Edmund Edgar @KK Social Minds (Reality Keys / Realitio)

**Topic:** Using Realitio: The crowd-sourced smart contract oracle

**Brief:**  Realitio lets your contracts find information about the real world, outsourcing information gathering directly from your contract to humans. Edmun will tell you how it works and how to use it.

The next announcement of this series is coming soon. Please stay tuned! Write your comments below if you have any thoughts, questions or doubts.

Eth Madness is the answer to the question 'How do I combine college basketball and decentralized technology, the two most important things in life?' 
Eth Madness is a smart contract based NCAA bracket challenge. We know we're not the first to do something like this, but we happen to be big college basketball fans at [Nodesmith](https://nodesmith.io) and wanted to try our hand at building a March Madness dApp.
You'll have to look elsewhere for your gambling fix - there is no entry fee - but we have funded the contract with a **500 DAI** prize pool.

&amp;nbsp;

How it works:

1. Go to [https://ethmadness.com](https://ethmadness.com) and fill out your bracket.
2. Submit your bracket via an Ethereum transaction - all your picks and the final tiebreaker score will be stored as a 256 bit value in the smart contract.
3. Watch all the games and root for your picks.
4. After the games have finalized, a handful of selected oracles will submit the correct 256 bit string representing which teams won each game (hopefully next year we'll use ChainLink for this!).
5. 350, 100, and 50 Dai will be distributed to the top three brackets!

&amp;nbsp;

Note: you won't be able to submit the exact same bracket (final tiebreaker score included) as another person.

&amp;nbsp;

---- 

&amp;nbsp;

Our expertise is on the infrastructure side, so it's always really fun for us take a break from that and build some dApps. But it's quite 
likely there are some bugs in the app or contract. Let us know what you find! The code
is all open source and available here: [https://github.com/nodesmith/eth-madness](https://github.com/nodesmith/eth-madness).

&amp;nbsp;

The contract itself can be found here: [0x10e612F9c80ed35D74a6B34aAeb18Db881cCB51E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10e612F9c80ed35D74a6B34aAeb18Db881cCB51E)f

&amp;nbsp;

We're still looking for a few oracles to help us out with the submitting of final results! If you're interested in helping out, 
let us know. u/jep37 or u/Souptacular any interest again this year?"

"Dear Ethereum enthusiasts,

&amp;#x200B;

**Please share with anyone that you know that does Ethereum. This is the mother of all Crypto lawsuits.**

The twitter account to follow: [https://twitter.com/A78gnstNYDFS](https://twitter.com/A78gnstNYDFS). *You can join the telegram group* ***AbolishTheBitlicense*** *for live updates that that.*

If that is the case and you know someone in New York City, let them know to show up at the courthouse **on March 28, 2019 at 1pm**. *(I posted the wrong date earlier.)*

&amp;#x200B;

I  was in Queens the other day and a business was advertising their online  Blockchain course. I went in while talking to the organizers, I realized that **their news came from Bangladesh** and they had no idea what is happening across the river. They were versed in Bangladeshi regulations but not in the New York one. I see the  same thing with communities from Africa, Latin America, Central Asia. 

![img](106njaveqln21 "" Queens, NY store front teaching Blockchain to the Bangladeshi community in NYC."")

I  am sure that no matter where you are, you talk with friends in the Ethereum space in New York City that don't participate in the Manhattan Etehereum scene.

We need the judges to see that the room is full of people concerned about  the legal future of cryptos in general. The message is to tell them to  pause and thing about the case.

The court room cannot be empty like what happened in Florida in the Espinoza case. **We need the court room full of people!**

"Centralization occurs when a minority have sufficient power to act against, or at least without regards to, the will of the majority.   

Leadership is not the same as centralization.  Leadership is what people voluntarily follow to places they wouldn't ordinarily go by themselves.   Real leadership is not anointed, or appointed.  It is voluntarily conferred upon individuals who stand forth and whom people voluntarily follow.

Sure... we can get this wrong.  We can create a position of unbalanced power, and give it the label ""leader"", and then let this position determine the direction of the community regardless of what the majority desires.   But this is no more ""leadership"" than painting a pig black and white and calling it a cow makes it a cow. It's just applying the wrong label.

What a distributed decentralized community demands of its leadership are people who understand leadership and demonstrate leadership.  When they cease to be heading in the direction that people will follow, they cease to be leaders of the community.     

It's an emergent position, not a position of appointment.  Indeed, if we make the mistake of putting the badge ""leader"" on an individual, we fail to recognize the importance of the position as one that must be continuously earned. 

So let's not be looking to appoint leaders.  Let's look to see who the leaders deserve to be.  And follow them.  

But only for as long as they truly lead where we are willing to go.

"A couple of weeks ago we posted for the first time, but here's a quick recap:

---

The dapp environment is in its infancy, and so, the UI and UX models are also developing. I've teamed up with a senior QA to analyse and give feedback regarding dapp usability, while I assist as an translator to speed up the process, with 2 years of web3 stack experience.

Let us know if you're interested in a feedback demo for your dapp's website! Drop a DM or reach out to cehhiro@cehhiro.com.

Last week we had our first crypto QA job with LocalEthereum. Everything went smoothly, and they were very pleased with our work. Shoutout to Michael for being an amazing employer.

We are eager to hearing for you!

TL;DR: QA for dapps. Reach out to cehhiro@cehhiro.com. Sample feedback before you decide if you need us (and probably will)."

**#39**

**Speaker:** Lisa Chu	@HTC Exodus

**Topic:** Rebuilding Trust and Security with Zion

**Brief:** EXODUS 1 is the first native web 3.0 blockchain phone with Zion Vault protecting your keys. Join us to find out how you can rebuild trust and security with us!

&amp;#x200B;

**#40**

**Speaker:** Roberto Saltini @PegaSys

**Topic:** IBFT 2.0: a robust PoA BFT consensus protocol for Ethereum

**Brief:** In this session Roberto will present IBFT 2.0 which is a Proof-of-Authority Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus protocol for Ethereum that ensures immediate finality, is robust in an eventually synchronous network model and features a dynamic validator set.

He will discuss the journey and motivations behind IBFT 2.0 together with its properties, use cases and a couple of very interesting performance improvements that we are planning to implement in a future version of the protocol. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#41**

**Speaker:** Gregory Markou	@ChainSafe Systems

**Topic:** How Open Source Collaboration is Building ETH2.0

**Brief:** The importance of collaboration and communication amongst different projects in Ethereum, and other networks, while building ETH2.0

&amp;#x200B;

**#42**

**Speaker:**James Waugh	@Axia Labs

**Topic:** Token Restructuring - Liquid Token Design, Governance &amp; Incentives vs Trade-offs

**Brief:** Token design has shifted vastly since the first tokens launched on top of Etheruem (Maker, Augur, Digix) into fluffy payment tokens that provide very little true utility - Looking into the future a number of these projects are deploying different methods to change, remove and rebuild these tokens into new and more equitable models.

&amp;#x200B;

**#43**

**Speaker:** Shashank Tiwari @Cryptin &amp; Gluon-Plasma

**Topic:** Scalable Account Based Systems on Ethereum

**Brief:** Plasma is soon becoming the most viable way to scale decentralized applications on the Ethereum network. Gluon-plasma (https://ethresear.ch/t/gluon-plasma-full-spec-for-non-custodial-exchanges/3931) is an open protocol that builds on the fundamentals of Plasma and extends it to provide additional capabilities for scalable and elastic systems. Provably secure and non-custodial in nature, it aims to realize the dream of a high speed decentralized future.

&amp;#x200B;

**#44**

**Speaker:** Tomasz Kolinko @Eveem.org

**Topic:** All the things we can do with decompiled smart contracts

**Brief:** A well decompiled contract can be as readable, if not more, as the original source code. Not just for humans, but for machines as well. This in turn allows for all kinds of interesting tools to be built on top of it. The talk will be a brief overview of these possible use cases, and of some things that we learned already by analysing smart contracts at scale.

&amp;#x200B;

**#45**

**Speaker:** Liam Horne	@L4

**Topic:** Counterfactual: State Channels Made Simple

**Brief:** Building state channel applications has historically been complicated. Counterfactual has taken the best research and translated it into an easy-to-use developer framework to help developers make decentralized applications that benefit from zero-fees and instant response times easy. Liam will explain how state channels work briefly and then show the framework.

&amp;#x200B;

**#46**

**Speaker:** Kain Warwick @Synthetix

**Topic:** Rethinking Finance for a Decentralized World

**Brief:** The first wave of decentralised platforms built on Ethereum usually tried to replicate the functionality of centralised systems directly often with poor trade-offs. We are now seeing solutions that take advantage of decentralisation. Just as we had to evolve solutions to legacy problems for the web and for mobile, we need to rethink how to solve legacy finance problems that leverage the unique properties of decentralisation. Looking at solutions like Uniswap vs Order book based DEX's may provide a path forward.

&amp;#x200B;

**#47**

**Speaker:** Zak Cole	@Whiteblock

**Topic:** ETH2.0 networking

**Brief:** Zak will be running a demo of the Lodestar and Artemis ETH2.0 clients communicating within a functional network using the Hobbits wire protocol that we developed for 2.0 testing purposes. He will also present the Bacon Vision beacon chain visualizer. These projects were developed in collaboration with the Artemis team (ConsenSys), Lodestar team (ChainSafe) and yeeth team (Dean Eigenmann).

&amp;#x200B;

**#48**

**Speaker:** Matthew Slipper@Kyokan

**Topic:** Building Production L2 Systems

**Brief:** There are lots of L2 protocols, but fewer production L2 systems. Through our work with SpankChain and our grant-funded Plasma MVP implementation, Kyokan has launched L2 systems on mainnet that transfer real value. This talk focuses on what we‚Äôve learned along the way, and presents a set of best practices and patterns to make building production L2 systems safer and easier.

"I usually hold back any complaints about Ethereum leadership because of the potential political fallout. However, I‚Äôm posting this anyway because I‚Äôm concerned that the core ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù might be beginning to devolve into what Bitcoin Core is today.

The potential conflict of interest is an issue in its own right, however the response to those concerns is a larger issue. The criticism of Afri‚Äôs provocative Tweet in the last week has been met with little-to-no response, and now Afri has ‚Äúgone dark‚Äù by wiping his Twitter account and [posting](https://twitter.com/5chdn/status/1097228987871436800) ‚ÄúI will no longer respond on Gitter, Skype, Discord, Slack, Wire, Twitter, and Reddit‚Äù.

Regardless of whether the initial concerns had merit, the response to them is irresponsible ‚Äî especially considering a huge fork is less than two weeks away. The decision of the Parity release manager to wipe his Twitter account and go dark 11 days before the Constantinople fork is a bad one. It‚Äôs a bad look for Parity, and it‚Äôs a bad look for Ethereum.

The voices of the community shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. We are the miners who support the network, we are the developers who give Ethereum its usefulness, we are the businesses who bring commerce to the public blockchain, and we are the investors who contributed money and time to make Ethereum possible. Without the community, Ethereum is nothing.

This isn‚Äôt a one-off event; it resembles the earlier EIP-999 mess (for those that don‚Äôt remember, EIP-999 was another proposal to unfreeze the Parity multisig-bug wallets). Afri‚Äôs [unexpected pull request to change the EIP‚Äôs state to ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù over a technicality, despite heated disagreement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8z0w0x/proposal_to_move_eip_999_to_accepted_state/), was widely criticised by the community. Similarly, it was never met with any public comment and I‚Äôm not aware of any response to date (except perhaps in private).

I believe the Ethereum leadership team should be held accountable to the community, and I don‚Äôt think this is a big ask. Ethereum is a multi-billion-dollar project to change the world, and it should be treated as such.

I'm looking forward to healthy disagreements and discussion.

Final notes:

1. Parity has done a great deal of good for Ethereum. I'm sure neither Afri or Parity are bad actors. I‚Äôm an active user of Parity, currently running eight full nodes. 
2. It would be fantastic if more people followed Bob Summerwill in his [approach](https://bobsummerwill.com/conflict-of-interests-statement/) to absolute transparency, especially if they‚Äôre involved in two possibly competing initiatives. I have always admired this approach.
3. As with any team working on promoting decentralization and/or free trade, I wish Polkadot success.
4. I have a financial and ideological interest in Ethereum succeeding."

I'm bit concerned that each time somebody accesses my page I'm calling my smart contract to get a list of created NFTs. I'm wondering if it is a proper way to go.

This bot automates making markets on Binance.

Where  other market making bots fail (ie. BitMex, Deribit, other attempts I've  made in the past) is by counting on the market to not be volatile.  Where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits  in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself, where  on BitMex and Deribit these spreads ar 0.25$ of a BTC, some smaller  markets on Binance have 1%.. 2%... 5% spreads, and greater-than-average  volumes.

You'll  want to have about $20 per market pair it's looking to trade, in the  base asset (BTC, BNB, ETH, etc...). It will look to trade more markets  if the targetSpread, targetVolDiv, targetVolMult are higher. The more  total funds in a particular base asset there are, the higher value the  orders will have.

If  for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of  considered pairs, it will continue selling that asset with the same sell  logic (on the quoteAsset+BNB market), while pausing buying it.

I  don't have enough personal funds available to run the bot, but I can  get a good amount of income if I share it and people use my ref link.  targetOrderSizeMult exists so that people can compete using the same bot  on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot  constantly, as you can set a % of your order size to ignore when there's  a bid or ask better than yours. When the volume that beats your price  is higher than the order size \* this multiplier, it'll re-enter the  market.

\--note  that you should never trust your API keys to a bot without proper code  review. Nefarious people out there will use your balance to manipulate  the price of very low liquid markets and pick up a huge amount of cheap  tokens from your hard-earned crypto--

'At the current time Binance rate limits are: 1200 requests per minute. 10 orders per second. 100,000 orders per 24hrs.'

There are no limits for unfilled orders, and at most it'll make about 6x 20 or so pairs x 2 orders, 1 cancel and 1 re-port a minute, along with checking balance and getting order books so a total of about \~500 a minute - not close to 1200 :)

On that note I've only been trading one pair, averaging 42 orders an hour or \~1000 per day, again by about 20 pairs would be 20 000 orders per day - a bit shy of 100k.

"First of all, congratulations to everyone who has contributed to the now successful fork. I recall this being answered a few times vaguely by Vitalik and some others, but is there a set plan to slowly increase gas limit from 8m to 10m and then to 12m since we are at historic lows on # of uncle blocks and have had a successful fork?"

"Hey all. I am the Co-Founder of [Zabo](https://zabo.com/index). We are releasing an app this year that lets you allocate a portion of your paycheck (direct deposit, paper check) between cash and crypto. 

Before working on Zabo our team did smart contract dev and auditing (as Modular). Our CEO Christopher Brown created the [EthPM Golang](https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-go) implementation and we also have some open-source [Ethereum libraries](https://github.com/Modular-Network/ethereum-libraries) as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question is: **how many of you would opt to split a portion of your pay into ETH automatically?** If the answer is ""Yes"", what type of custody would you prefer?

&amp;#x200B;

We are trying to get a sense of how many people / teams would want something like this and how many would want self-custody vs custodial wallets. We currently pay 40% our team 100% in ETH (both international) and the process is not ideal - it's manual and involves more steps than it should.

"Hey all!  
So, I recently stumbled upon [Verity](https://alpha.verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum), a smart contract oracle that boasts to be fully decentralized.

&amp;#x200B;

They seem to be still on the Ropsten test network with a fully working product already - [Verity Alpha](https://alpha.verity.network/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit%20posts&amp;utm_campaign=ethereum) on which they reward you with ETH and their own VTY token. So, I assume they should be going to the main net soon?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have just found out that they also got a $150k investment from some fund in San Francisco which includes Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and others. :O So it seems they are actually legit.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm still new to it, so I was wondering if anyone heard of it yet and what have your experiences been with them so far?"

"Hey everybody, looking for a few answers on Ethereum PoS.. I'm familiar with the difference between PoW and PoS, but what I'm not sure about is: a) Aside from owning 32 ETH or pooling my 3/6/12 ETH, how would I participate in the PoS process and generate income from it? b) It is my understanding that those who chose to stake their ETH will be given a weighted vote to validate new transactions, and if they vote to validate a transaction that is found invalid they lose their staked ETH. If this is the case, how much technical expertise would be needed to vote?

I apologize if my questions/ general understanding of this concept is rudimentary, if I'm missing anything else please lmk. Thanks fam!"



"I apologise for the fairly silly question, but I am less familiar with account based chains.

In BTC, SPV can be done easily because verifying a tx exists in a block guarantees the tx has completed successfully.

In ETH, verifying a tx is included in a block does NOT guarantee the actual value was transferred, because you can run out of gas or fail for other reasons.

So how does SPV actually with in ETH?"

"I'd like to present my simple-minded analysis (and critique) of a recent article by Kent Barton, titled ""[Scaling Civility: How to Preserve Ethereum's Most Crucial Strength](https://blog.goodaudience.com/scaling-civility-how-to-preserve-ethereums-most-crucial-strength-439e227e3091)"". I'm doing this not to offend or insult but because I believe it showcases a pathological sentiment among a radical subset of developers and points to a deeper socio-systemic issue.

The article begins with a rather deceptive platitude to get everyone on the same page:

&gt;Throughout most of its existence, Ethereum has been a place where crypto adventurers of all stripes can explore, build, debate, and learn within the confines of a friendly, respectful, and non-judgemental community.

I called it deceptive because it appears to be a safe space fantasy born from someone with a conference-going sense of identity. Kent is the founder of Ethereum Denver. He has a rather peculiar, interpersonal, perspective of a certain part of the ""Ethereum developer community in Denver"" (and one might assume on GitHub and other similar online dev circles). And yes, perhaps, his view of the ""community"" is more expansive than that, but I strongly doubt it, for all the reasons I'll elaborate in this response. 

For one thing, Someone with a genuine sense of the scope of the Ethereum community would understand it's a diverse global movement embracing various subcultures with their own distinct ideologies and preferences. To be a member of the Ethereum community isn't to abandon your own cultural identity. There's no reason to think someone's membership in the community is contingent on being a developer or being a person who is uncritically ""friendly, respectful, and non-judgmental"" (and frankly, it should go without saying that one shouldn't have to be). If some part of the community has an issue with another person or company, it's their natural civil right to express it (whenever and wherever they please). Shaming, silencing, or ostracizing them by labeling them as a non-dev or as ""unfriendly, disrespectful, or judgmental"" is most definitely counter-productive to the kind of culture I understand the Ethereum community to be aspiring.

Kent is most certainly speaking about a highly narrow subset of the development community when he talks about the ""fertile ground for innovation"" and ""salubrious climate"", which he reduces quite casually and without thought to things like: ""the relatively massive number of active developers on github and at conferences/hackathons""; or once again the ""proliferation of projects and emergence of entirely new proto-industries"". This is Kent's rather distorted context.

From the community from this twisted lens, it's clear to see why Kent can't grok the events of the past few weeks (with regard to the Afri debacle, conflict of interest debate, Ryan Zurrer issue, and ensuing moderation discussion. He speaks of these events as ""ugly"" and a ""very different picture"" (comparing it to his own ""awesome and enjoyable"" atmosphere). Perhaps Kent wasn't here for the DAO fork debate, which was far worse by practically all standards. Anyway, bewildered by these differences, Kent wondered about the cause and what he (and presumably other developers) can do about it.

He cites the [Status survey on ""Ethereum values""](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nmWZKJq-ndF0uZGnHgQZq7Lm2_0xJbYWxmQTOrgIFfg/edit#gid=840981558) to articulate his explanation. Kent claims one of the key takeaways from this survey ""was a strong sense that Reddit is no longer a place for positive and constructive discussion"". He then tries to summarize this supposed sentiment by cherry picking an anonymous responder, who said:

&gt;The online community is beset by trolls who I feel manage to have an outsized impact on the community. We need tools that can represent stakeholders better than whoever posts most frequently on Reddit.

This is a very misleading statement for at least 3 important reasons: 1) the majority of respondents who bothered to fill out the survey were members of the development community, 2) the survey only covered about 200 people (not at all a representative sample), and 3) contrary to what Kent says the survey is very much undecided about Reddit.

There is a total of 26 instances of the keyword ""Reddit"" in the survey. After parsing these results for sentiment, I found 9 negative, 8 positive, and 9 neutral/ambiguous. In the negative set, there were a few common sense concerns about trolls, 1 person complained about a toxic reaction on Reddit over the Parity fund recovery issue, 2 people had something bad to say about the Reddit user Deviatefish (they gave him as an example of a bad community member), 1 person felt unhappy about the original community losing their sense of group identity to the newcomers, 1 person claimed the threads were manipulated, with the very last person (Taylor Monahan as it turns out), gracing us with the following in response to the question ""Is there anything in the community that exhausts or tires you?"":

&gt;""Going on reddit. Literally. I'm a fucking reddit moderator and opening reddit exhausts me these days. It's so sad. It used to invigorate me to talk and connect with random people but these days theres so much hate. And not hate as in questioning projects or questioning why something is or isn't a certain way, but just straight hate and ulterior motives.""

This is a disturbing statement coming from a community moderator, in my opinion. But regardless, I wouldn't call these negative remarks indicative of the belief that Reddit was ""no longer a place for positive and constructive discussion"". It's my observation rather that discussion simply dissipated when the ""dev community"" decided to jump onto Twitter, where they can just isolate themselves in their little safe space cocoons. That, plus the split into the Ethereum Magicians forum, is what stifled community discourse on Reddit if I'm not mistaken. The community here has very little blame to shoulder.

Moving on to the positive set I found 3 people who cited Reddit as one of the communities related to Ethereum, 1 person had something good to say about the Reddit user DCinvester, 1 person had something good to say about the Reddit user Deviatefish, 1 person talked about how it was nice to put faces to Reddit profiles, 1 person offered participation on Reddit as an example of what a good community member would do, and 1 final person said one of their happiest memories was on Reddit. I'd like to mark out for special attention the person who offered Deviatefish as a good community member (or role model). Here's the reason they gave for choosing this person:

&gt;""His tendency to dissent from the majority opinion using logical arguments is beneficial to avoiding groupthink in our community.""

Groupthink is indeed the right word to describe what many people have observed recently. I think, contrary to the dev's posturing regarding the so-called toxic Reddit mob mentality, it's actually the devs who have fallen prey to this mentality. In their escape into the Twitterverse, insider-hopping conference circuit, magisterial council of the Magicians, and other privileged zones, the devs have forgotten all about the unsung forces who made Ethereum a global phenomenon. Many devs indeed have forgotten who this infrastructure was meant to serve. It's very likely many of these devs just cashed in on the crypto bubble and had a nice laugh building their ""start ups"" or whatever it was they thought they were doing by breaking people's trust and taking the public for granted. Many of these devs have simply assumed we would have their back, but it need not be that way if we all decide it to be otherwise. It's time you recognize the extent of your self-serving insulation and mean-spirited aversion toward the very people who make up the lifeblood of this ecosystem.

Never assume Ethereum is so glorious and self-sufficient that it can't be reduced to a momentary craze; a nowhere cult with no real destination. Never assume you're a protected class with a higher calling or status than the rest of us.

Continuing my analysis (or is it a critique at this point?), the article doesn't aspire to a cohesive global community identity. It actually praises the opposite: a proliferation of communication mediums and fracturing of all discourse. Kent seems to think everyone gets a bubble of their choosing: Twitter for some folks, Magicians and Ethresear.ch for others, or why not just keep all the ""meaningful discussion"" in back channels or private rooms? Where the big bad mob can't hear you? That seems to be where this line of thinking is going, I believe. The social ""vacuum"" Kent speaks about is actually populated by more than mere ""newcomers"", ""people who are simply in it for the money"", and rancid ""trolls""... My goodness Kent, don't you realize the ""community"" is larger than your imaginary technocratic bubble of crypto-nobles? Many of us know exactly what's going on and we don't care to be your serfs in the New Kingdom you're building. Don't pretend to speak for ""us"".

At this point, I'd like to simply solve the puzzle and offer this rather unsurprising possibility. Kent (whether consciously or unconsciously) wishes to disempower and marginalize the community voice because he's: 1) good friends with people at Parity (or the Web3 Foundation), 2) biased about Parity's multisig fund recovery efforts, and/or 3) invested in the Polkadot Network in some manner. Before you go off saying, ""that's his choice"", understand that I know it's his choice. It's perfectly fine if he's ""diversified"", but then he shouldn't be pretending to speak about what's best for the Ethereum community and rallying the troops against people who have no interest whatsoever in supporting the Parity trifecta of doom. You see, it's also my choice to view this as a threat (and have good reason to view it as a threat) and then also alert people to the best of my ability that it is in fact a threat. My hopes and dreams and fears (and those of countless others) can't just be wished away just because Kent is a reputable figure in the community and I'm not; or because there might be rampant infidelity in this ecosystem and people need to cover their asses by shutting everyone up. Please assess the content of what's said (and the larger context in which it is being communicated) rather than the person saying it.

Allow me to elaborate a bit more. On Twitter, Kent introduced his article with [this statement](https://twitter.com/crn_maximizer/status/1105907959920582656):

&gt;""Occasional community drama is inevitable. A steady decline into maximalism, personal attacks, trolling, and dogmatism is not.""

Sound familiar? This is the confused anti-maximalist Parity narrative I mentioned in another thread. Thankfully, a user by the name of ""CRN"" caught on to this disturbing statement and questioned Kent further to find out what he meant by the ""strong hints of tribalism and maximalism"", arguing ""You give no support for this as a root cause. If you provided some, we could argue them. Without any there's nothing to rebut. Remember Hitchens's razor: that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.""

In response to this, Kent said:

&gt;I was thinking specifically about the ""PARITY BAD! PARITY EVIL!"" knee-jerk reaction (by some) that led to the Afri situation. \[we might reasonably assume all other negative sentiment regarding Parity, past and present, is also presupposed by this remark\]

And in the article itself, he says:

&gt;Newcomers who are less informed, have no idea about the context and history regarding something like Parity and their plans, and are easily swayed by vocal, noisy shrill opinions. \[are we starting to see the pattern here? the plebs just don't get the grande design, you feel me?; we're uninformed bag holding idiots according to this fellow\]

Followed by this:

&gt;""Anything that feeds that narrative (You can‚Äôt sync a full node! Sharding will never work! **Polkadot will replace Ethereum!**"" \[my emphasis; again, he's trying to gaslight us, as if there's no competition to speak of\]

And then this:

&gt;""Most relevant for our current problem are **the zero-sum fallacy (Polkadot‚Äôs gains are Ethereum‚Äôs losses),** and the echo chamber created by shrill trolls on reddit."" \[again, my emphasis; more condescension and gaslighting\]

And why not throw this one in too (because we're being so ""friendly, respectful and non-judgmental"", right Kent?):

&gt;We should remind people not to conflate the assholes who post on /r/ethereum with the broader Ethereum community.

I don't think my blood is the only thing boiling when remarks like this get flung about so carelessly by such a ""high ranking and trusted"" figure. It boils all the more when I think about how this kind of sentiment has likely already taken root in the mind's of other impressionable devs in the community. There's so much venom in this man's words you'd be forgiven for thinking you were engaging with one of the fabled Reddit trolls he hates so much. Seriously, please do read the entire article. This man is absolutely livid. His ""polite"" discourse conceals nothing.

If you can't smell something is rotten with this Parity/Polkdaot/Web3 drama, you're really not paying attention. There are many conflicted devs working in this space right now who seem completely oblivious to the perverse incentives to which they're exposed and are actively trying to create this silly narrative about how the ignorant masses just don't get how cool life will be with Polkadot and company running the show. We're all just newcomers, get-rich-quick nutters, and idiot trolls with no context, remember? Only the crypto-nobles understand the ""master plan"", you see?; the plan that was supposed to make them a fucking fortune. So you better fall in line and drink the Polkadot Kool-Aid.

Honestly, I've been in this space way longer than most of these self-righteous devs and I can say without a doubt there's some trippy brainwashing/propaganda going on here. It's like Invasion of the Blockchain Body Snatchers out there.

Don't say I didn't warn you."

I'm asking a question. Is there any opinions on the subject? thank you
"12/24 word seeds (paper key) are used to back-up and secure a variety of wallets. Lots of apps/ledger/trezor have multiple cryptocurrency types secured with a SINGLE seed phrase. Are these seeds transferable into any other wallet of the particular currency individually? So if on my ledger I have ethereum can i use my 24 word LEDGER private seed phrase in a coinbase ios ethereum wallet? The reason I ask is I have successfully used the same 12 word seed phrase on cipher app ios, metamask chrome, and coinbase wallet ios.  But there is clearly a difference between the 12 and 24 words, I haven't seen a space for 24 words of a ledger wallet.

do all ethereum app wallets have universally transferable 12 word seeds?

thanks"

"Let's say I have a collection of media I want to preserve.

My ideal system would have as many of these attributes as possible:

**Censorship resistance.** Uploaded files should be as difficult or cost-prohibitive to remove from the backend as possible. File removal should be unfeasible for bad actors, hackers, DDoS attackers, and dapp developers. It should not be trivial for governments and should withstand lawyers or legal letters as there should be no centralized point for them to attack.

**Internet frontends.** There should be a simple mechanism to download these files from a normal browser like Google Chrome. If frontend A censors the content, it should still be available from frontends B, C, and D. Rolling out your own frontend should be trivial. Think something like The Pirate Bay.

**Upload permanence.** Once a file uploads, it should stay uploaded for as long as possible. There should be no expiration. At the least, there should be a reasonable expectation the file will remain on the backend for 5 years or more.

**Hash-based searches.** If you know the hash of a file, you should be able to use that hash to find and download the file through one of the frontends.

**Large file sizes.** You should be able to upload files around 10 GB in size. If there is a cost associated with this, then the lower the better.

**Upload it and forget it.** After I upload it, I shouldn't need to remain online for other people to download it.

What most meets these criteria right now? Is there anything coming down the pipeline that meets more of these criteria?

I already have some ideas, but I'm looking for suggestion from someone with more experience with Ethereum than I have."

"I'm a random guy who has managed to accumulate enough ETH to be a validator (assuming Vitalik is right - 32ETH). This bag is a substantial share of my net worth.

My question is, does anybody actually recommend that I and people like me make the effort to become a validator? 

I would need to buy the hardware and learn everything I would need to know to set up a node.

I don't foresee myself being able to learn enough to confidently start staking with my own validator. As much as I read about crypto stuff (a lot) I still don't fully understand Blockchain technology enough to confidently talk about it and answer any skepticism in the tech let alone have enough knowledge of the mechanics and code behind staking to give myself confidence in setting up a validator.

I could instead join a staking pool but then I'm giving custody of my ETH to somebody else and doesn't that defeat the whole point of staking?

I feel like for me to have enough confidence to become a validator would require studying the tech full time in a classroom environment being taught by an expert."

"I stumbled upon a podcast with Andreas Antanopoulos where at a certain moment he talks about ETH and the speculative value it has been given by the market. I forgot at what timestamp so I have to listen to it all over again but I put the link of the podcast below :

https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/andreas-m-antonopoulos-on-what-happens-when-bitcoin-takes-over

As far as I understand he says that for the Ethereum network to work properly the price of ETH must only reflect the demand for people using it to pay for uncensorable computation. Essentially what he was saying is that if you hold ETH with the intention of selling it at a higher price you are negatively effecting the network. So if the cost of gas (ETH) is a fortune because people use ETH (the fuel) it as a store of value, it makes it harder and harder to for many DAPP projects to operate?

This would mean ethereum is doomed to fail. Which I don't believe. So probably I missed something?

"The online mode of payment has enabled people across the world to pay and transfer funds easily, without the barrier of any geographical restriction. Within a digital transaction, consumers merely have to confirm the purchase and the payment is processed in no time. However, there are some critical pitfalls that keep people from harnessing optimum benefits out of electronic means of payment transfer.

## Essential Setbacks Associated with Fiat Currency Transfers

* **Instability in Value of Fund**

With passing years, the value of fiat money tends to depreciate, leading to inflation pressure because of higher import prices and increased export demands. It generates a critical issue for businesses with small capital and restricts them to be a part of the global market.

* **Lack of Exposure to Banking System**

Even in this era of globalisation, merely 41% of the global population own bank accounts. More than half of the world population still cannot transact or trade beyond their physical boundaries.

* **Lack of Security**

Fiat money transactions are always vulnerable to online fraud as the same card (debit or credit) can be used by anyone to make payment without adequate authorisation. Additionally, to complete an online transaction, users have to submit their personal information, thereby increasing the chances of identity theft."

"*This post was written and approved by the following moderators (in alphabetical order): Heliumcraft, insomniasexx, nickjohnson, rzurrer, Souptacular, Twigwam*

*Not everyone was able to weigh in at the time of posting, and individual mods may weigh in with their personal views in the comments of this post.*

# Purpose

The goal of this post is to communicate why the recent thread calling for the removal of rzurrer was removed by moderators and open a discussion about what we want this subreddit to be moving forward and what moderators should be and do. 

# Why remove the thread?

A number of the moderators who were online at the time of the removal agreed that the post was in violation of one of our most important subreddit rules:

&gt; No inappropriate behavior. This includes, but is not limited to: personal attacks, threats of violence, gossip, slurs of any kind, posting people's private information.

While not all comments were in violation, the collective nature of the thead, including the title of the original post, and tone of subsequent conversation was focused largely on attacking a single person, rather than having a healthy debate regarding the subject at hand.

For this reason, those around at the time agreed collectively to remove the post.

Upon further discussion and as more moderators came online, it became apparent that not all moderators were in agreement about the decision. We have been discussing internally what actions moderators should take, shouldn't take, and how we reach consensus, especially when those decisions are subjective and in regards to polarizing posts. 

# Will we remove any of the current moderators?

Not at this time.

### Right now:

We remove moderators when and if they are a not upholding their duty as a moderator.

We are all very sensitive to the potential for moderators to act as censors. For this reason, our role as a moderator is primarily to:

- Prevent spam or scams.

- Approve valid posts that were caught by the automoderator.

- Take action on posts that violate our rules.

- Internally discuss posts that fall into a gray area before taking action.

We typically have a discussion internally on posts or comments that require subjective decision-making or fall into a ‚Äúgray area‚Äù in terms of the rules. This includes things like ‚Äúpersonal attack‚Äù posts, ‚Äúis ProgPow mining discussion or technical discussion?‚Äù, etc. We rely on one another to ensure a single person‚Äôs views aren‚Äôt controlling what is seen, or not seen, in the subreddit. 

None of the mods have moderated a post regarding themselves. Furthermore, his moderation actions, especially in the past week, have been to approve valuable posts that were improperly removed by the automoderator.

### Moving Forward:

We want to open a discussion here on what moderators should be, what actions moderators should take, and how they should make those decisions. With this information, we will make a decision on what moderators will remain, which will leave, and potentially who would be good people to add to the moderation team.

This will also guide moderations decisions moving forward and give us all (community member and moderators) a more tangible understanding of the role of moderators in /r/ethereum. We hope to add a transparent post summarizing this information which can be helpful for community members, current moderators, and to onboard new moderators. 

# What we hope this subreddit is

As the community grows, the attitudes, goals, and views of community members become more diverse. This is a huge positive, but comes with some growing pains. While having disagreements and differing viewpoints is valuable and makes the ecosystem more robust, the way those disagreements are communicated and discussed can lead to toxicity and tribalism, rather than the aforementioned robustness.

We will not tolerate personal attacks or ‚Äòwitch hunts‚Äô. 

We support healthy discussion regarding the role of moderators. We do not discourage the questioning of what we do, or don‚Äôt do, or why we do it.

We encourage conversations regarding Ethereum‚Äôs role in the larger ecosystem and how Ethereum and the community continue to grow and evolve. 

We would especially encourage conversations that have a wider impact on Ethereum and the community. For example: discussing conflict of interests, how it‚Äôs handled in the traditional world, how you think it should be handled in this decentralized ecosystem are all incredibly valuable. Accusing someone of having a conflict of interest and calling for their head is not.

We do not expect, nor desire, a community that is in perfect agreement all the time.  A healthy community should be diverse, containing a lot of people with a lot of different backgrounds and world views.

We do not aim to limit or remove discussions that debate polarizing topics. We should be encouraging discourse, controversial debates, and talking about problems openly.

We do hope that this community will continue to be welcoming, inclusive, diverse, and respectful of one another, especially during times of disagreement. 

# Open for discussion 

We would like the discussion on this post to revolve around the aforementioned topics. We are especially interested in hearing what **you** hope this subreddit is, what types of content and discussions should be encouraged, and how we all can encourage those types of conversations.

We would also like to discuss what role moderators should play in this community. How should posts like the aforementioned post be handled? What makes someone a good moderator?

We are looking forward to having a healthy, open discussion here that will lead to a more positive environment for the progression of Ethereum and a more transparent process for moderators of this subreddit.

Thank you.

"Hey all, so I recently returned to the world of crypto after taking a \~6month hiatus for unrelated reasons.  Anyways, I had some ETC in EtherWallet that I had bookmarked here: [https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet](https://ethereumproject.github.io/etherwallet)

The site now seems all but shut down.  Am I screwed or is there any way to recover the ETC i had there?

&amp;#x200B;

TIA"

"First off I'd like to say that I appreciate the work of the developers and researchers in Ethereum. It's specifically because **I want to support them** that I am forced to ask these difficult questions from the ""leadership"" of Ethereum.

The facts seem to be as follows (please correct me if I'm mistaken):

* Polkadot has a different technical implementation but will be competing for the same market share as ethereum's beacon chain/ sharding implementation.

* Polkadot (via Parity) was given 5mm by the EF

* Afri, who works on Parity, Polkadot and Ethereum makes a snide tweet about ETH's roadmap/ future being futile because of Polkadot's superior launch timeline (and... he is the one in charge of ethereum's launch timeline and has called for delays in the face of significant resistance in the recent past).
* In response the community receives full silence from all of the explicit leadership of Ethereum and from Afri himself.
* In the place of a strategic direction/ vision/ response to this bomb, we get an AMA from Ethereum's Santa where no one asks any tough questions (because they know it's not his job to answer them), they smile and thanks him for being awesome (which he is) and it's all OK. 

**wat**

All of this is in the wake of a fairly recent change to the development schedule and timeline whereby we find out we are still 2+ years away from a full implementation of POS and sharding (assuming they get it right the first time). I swallowed my tongue in the wake of this in good faith - but I can't or won't keep quiet until the elephants in the room are addressed...

* Is Afri still working on ETH?
* Why is the beacon chain vision/ timeline still a viable option if polkadot will be live a full year earlier?
* Why have all of the implicit ""leadership"" of Ethereum been so quiet up until now? 
* If the Ethereum foundation doesn't provide a structure for guidance/ damage control in situations like this, what exactly is it's function?
* What is the harm in making this implicit leadership more explicit? Or are we reinventing that too? "
